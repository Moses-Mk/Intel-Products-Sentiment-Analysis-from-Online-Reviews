2,Works flawlessly! Allows 2 unique displays with 2018 MacBook Pro (Intel),"UPDATE (from 5 stars to 2 stars): JAN 2023: One of the HDMI ports stopped working, so now this thing has become pretty useless to me. If it had continued working, this would have been great. But unfortunately it randomly stopped working one day and it hasn't worked since.<br /><br />This little thing has been wonderful. I have a 2018 MacBook Pro (Intel, not M1/M2) and I was looking for a dock that would allow me to use 2 separate monitors with the laptop lid closed, and this one is perfect.<br /><br />It is pretty small (5"" x 2"" x 0.5"", smaller than a Pro Max iPhone) and has a premium metal (?) feel to it (all I know is that it isn't plastic). All you need to do is plug it into the MBP and it works from there (side note: you need to install a quick driver before using the dock, but it's very simple)<br /><br />I appreciate that it allows for pass through charging (which also ensures that high-energy USB devices receive ample power). Additionally, it is really nice that this has both DisplayPort AND HDMI, which is not common based on what I've seen.<br /><br />My only gripe with this is that there are only 2x USB ports (which I knew when I bought it). If you're looking for an easy to use Thunderbolt dock for your MacBook Pro, get this one.",0,False
2,"Doesn't support 2 displays, even for Intel Macs","I am quite disappointed in this dock. It had lots of positive reviews, but for my Intel (not M1/M2) Macbook Pro (2018), it only lets you output to 1 unique monitor (if you have more than 1 monitor plugged in, they will all show the same thing), even if your laptop lid is closed.<br /><br />The description said that for M1/M2 Macs, all the external monitors would show the same thing. But this is apparently the case for Intel Macs as well.<br /><br />Would NOT recommend if you have an Intel Mac and want to use 2 unique external monitors.",0,False

5,Such an intelligent watch! Incredible!,"My wife loves this Amazfit Bip Pro 3 Smart Watch! She was using a generic brand before this, so this Bip Pro 3 just blows her old one away! This is seriously such an intelligent watch!<br /><br />First of all, it charges quickly and holds it’s charge for a long time. So you don’t have to charge it often. The charger itself is small and doesn’t take up much space.<br /><br />Second, the band is very comfortable. It is comfortable to even wear while sleeping. Speaking of sleeping, this watch monitors your sleeping habits: When you fall into a deep sleep (REM), light sleep, or if you have difficulties breathing while sleeping. Seeing the results of this after a full nights sleep is amazing! The things you never knew before!<br /><br />It monitors your activities, steps, heart rate, and stress levels. It can even tell if you are in a relaxed mood or not. Impressive!<br /><br />The app is so easy to use and you can control all of the features of the watch directly through the app. The watch even has an alarm clock if you want to use this instead of a traditional alarm clock or a phone. It will vibrate when it is time to wake up!<br /><br />So far, this watch has been my wife’s best friend. Far less expensive than a Fit Bit and well worth the price. It’s fantastic!",2,False

3,i4 Intellicharge universal smart battery Charger from NITECORE,"I ordered this NITECORE i4 Intellicharge universal smart battery Charger to enhance my charging needs, specifically my NCR 18650 batteries.  I also have a Lacrosse BC-700 I use primarily for AA and AAA batteries and I think it has been the best charger I have owned for this use.  I also own a MP-906 for charging my seldom used C, D and 9 volt batteries and I also like it and it does a good job charging these specific batteries for me.  I recently realized the more frequent purchase of the 3.7v Li-ion batteries were being charged with a cheap charger I got with a couple of purchases I made for Led Flashlights and a storage device.  I wanted a smart charger for them and the safe charging that is capable with a microprocessor controlled device for this purpose.  I have already tried it with my rechargeables, AA, C and my Li-ion batteries.  The design of the positive terminal contact for batteries charging is a bump of chromed metal which caused the battery to slide off to the side, an irritant to me and the Li-ion batteries with the flat positive end needs some manipulation and for me, a magnet, to get them to seat for charging.  If this won't bother you, OK.  What I have noticed first was the AA rechargeable Alkaline batteries were charged up to a slightly higher value, 1.5+ as to the 1.35 or so I got with the Lacrosse, Similar results came with the C cells and now the Li-ion batteries. My use of rechargeable alkaline batteries in this charger makes them get hot if they stay in the charger past topping out, so I only charge them while I am right there and I do not leave them in the charger unattended - ever.  If you do this you will most likely have problems.  I should just use the charger that came with them, that I didn't mention before, as they are a special trial battery for me.  They are Igo.  I'm happy at this time and if it holds up and continues to impress me, like my Lacrosse has for many years, I may up the stars given in this review.  Time will tell.  After using this charger now along side other smart chargers I have purchased since purchasing this unit I generally feel this $20 unit is not my best charger, the LittoKala 260 is my most trusted smart charger for several reasons, the least of which is it's ability to discharge and recharge a cylindrical battery of lithium ion type design. This battery charger is now used sparingly and will go the way of chargers that don't do what you want them to and really just disappoints.",3,True
5,Intel 530 Series 240GB 2.5-Inch Internal Solid State Drive (Reseller Kit) SSDSC2BW240A4K5 by Intel,"I had a programming glitch or a virus on my computer that was causing my regular use of a MY.MSN home page and a use of Amazon.com going bonkers and that was causing it to continuously load and reload pages until it drove me crazy and would freeze up my computer.  I did what I could to remove my Internet Explorer and reload it to make my problem go away to no avail and just decided to start over with a fast solid state drive.  I just loaded my programming needs and a couple of games on it and will designate other storage needs to go to my old drives on a standalone enclosure.

4,"Dell i3464-3000BLK-PUS Inspiron AIO, 23.8"" AIO, (7th Gen Core i3 (up to 2.40 GHz), 8GB, 1TB HDD, Intel HD Graphics 620, Black","My daughter and I set this computer up yesterday so my review is not based on weeks/months use of it.  However, I can probably tell you some things that might be good to know.  First of all, I am NOT computer techy and will not delve into the specs.  Besides, all that is already listed in the product description.  It runs on Windows 10, 64-bit. I'm not super-fond of any Windows platform for privacy reasons, but overall it seems to function well with few problems thus far.<br /><br />The set up was very easy.  Actually the most difficult part was clearing away the previous computer and all it's various components.  There is no separate CPU which I find to be absolutely delightful.  I actually have a nice, open space on the floor where the old one sat.  The CPU is inside the monitor, as well as the DVD drive.  It comes with all the cords you need, including a wireless mouse and keypad.  I was surprised that the sound from the monitor was much better than any other monitor with speakers I've ever used. It wasn't nearly what an audiophile would want, but good enough for basic listening needs.  I still attached my separate sound system because I love really good sound.  The Bluetooth function connected quickly to all my devices.<br /><br />The colors are vivid and defined, the monitor can be angled for different views, and everything is adjustable.  The included instruction showed a base plate for the monitor but mine did not have one.  The monitor stands just fine none-the-less.  The DVD drive is mounted on the right-side of the monitor and seems to work very well.  We had this up and running in about 20 minutes and we were moving kind of slowly.<br /><br />What did not work at all was the Netflix app.  It needs to be uninstalled and re-installed from the Google Play Store.  It will give an error code but it was an easy fix.  The Cortana feature on this computer only works when the computer is initially booted.  Afterwards it fails to hear although I have gone through the mike wizard set-up several times.  I don't know what is wrong with that but it might be something most people would like have working well.  Also, the mouse &#34;copy/paste&#34; function doesn't work. It will copy but you have physically hit &#34;control V&#34; to get it to paste.  It seems to be fast - it moves from webpage to webpage rapidly, movies and videos have yet to glitch, and......it' so quiet.  My previous computer was noisy all the time.  This one is so very, quite.....no cpu sounds at all.<br /><br />Overall so far:  I like it, I wish the Cortana worked like it's supposed too, it's fast and the monitor is large and clear.  Also it's touch screen so you can just touch any app on it to open it up. I'm actually to lazy to lean that far and prefer to use my mouse, but it seems to be a reliably working feature.  However, the touch screen makes it really easy and fast to delete a bunch of pictures.  I had a LOT of pictures from my kid's various science projects that I no longer needed and just touching the screen marking them for deletion was about 20x faster than using a mouse. I will definitely update this review as I use this computer more.  If anything malfunctions or is super wonderful I'll report back.  As of this review this computer costs $729.99.  It also has many various ports on the sides and rear and are very easy to access.",20,False

It worked pretty well that this SSD at both 150 GB and 180 GB sizes was pretty reliable and made older laptops to boot up completely in about 15-20 seconds. The overall performance of a laptop also depends on CPU and RAM, but this SSD is the cheapest upgrade to provide significant boost to a laptop's performance.

5,because they beat the hell out of intel's stupid integrated graphics.,"i used to be an intel & nvidia fan until i realized that AMD has a better grip on processing graphics. frankly, intel graphics suck and they should just give up on that. i really don't care what the benchmarks say with regard to speed--what does really matter is how it all works together for a great gaming experience, and that is what i get with AMD.  i have purchased several computers for myself as well as for my family members and I always hold out for AMD processor and graphics.  IT WORKS! i feel sorry sometimes for people who get fooled by intel and their integrated graphics--they have never succeeded in that department but somehow they manage to fool some of the manufacturers. i decided a long time ago i would rather have great graphics than to worry about business apps that carry out to an extra decimal place or two.  a great combination and best bang for the buck is a gateway DX series desktop with an AMD multi-core processor--now that is a real powerhouse that beats the competition for quality function.",0,False
3,(Now Discontinued) Exceptional Android tablet in many ways - but beware of app incompatabilities - Android on Intel issue.,"Summary:  Discontinued model, won’t run all Android apps, no more security updates from Dell – but still has a number of fine qualities.<br /><br />Pros:<br />• Display = Spectacularly gorgeous, 2560 x 1600 OLED<br />• Build quality = High<br />• Networking performance = Superb speed, short range (stay near your wireless access point)<br />• Streaming experience = Excellent<br />• Heat dissipation = What heat? This runs cool<br />• Battery life = Long and efficient, once you tune settings and remove unwanted apps<br />• Ease of use = Ultra light weight, beautiful edge-to-edge display (tip:  I combine mine with a grippy third-party holder for ease of handling)<br /><br />Cons:<br />• Chip architecture runs most, but not all, Android apps.  (Only runs Android apps supported for Intel - but the prominent chip for Android apps is ARM, instead.)  If your favorite app is not supported, it’s probably going to be a deal-breaker for you.<br />• App compatibility can change as publishers add/remove Intel support from their new releases of Android apps.  (First-hand experience with this issue.) Do your own research – then live with (potentially changing) results.<br />• Discontinued model – no new Android versions, no more system security updates – though you can still update individual apps with newer releases, uninstall, and replace apps.  Dell discontinued its entire mobile product line in June 2016.<br /><br />Suggested use:  A fine secondary Android tablet for your home or travel use - if your apps are supported.  Won’t support apps written exclusively for dominant chip architecture for Android (ARM) - and as a discontinued series, there are no more system or security updates pushed by Dell.  Since future use is limited, I’d watch for a low price, before buying.<br /><br />My review here had a long history of changes since first authored in Feb 2015.  As a service to buyers, I’m paring it down to above summary only now, but you’ll detect in the comments history that it raised lots of useful discussion and even some controversy.  My rating for this model has changed radically in response to altered app compatibility and Dell's eventual discontinuance of its mobile line.  When my own favorite app received a mandatory publisher update which could no longer be run on an Intel chip, I ultimately bought a different, ARM-based Android tablet to replace this tablet, well before end of useful life should have occurred for this Dell model, so I felt genuinely burned as a consumer and reflected that into my review history as well.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you know and accept the limitations, this is still an amazing work of engineering.  Assuming you get a good unit, and at a low price, you’ll get some nice, if limited, use from it.  It’s still my own favorite tablet for travel use, for instance.",134,False

5,Intel NUC Mini PC 12th Gen Core i5-1240P 32GB DDR4 RAM 512GB NVm.2 SSD,"Wow!  Where to begin with this thing?  For some background, I'm a PC enthusiast and regularly build my own rigs.  I hadn't seen these Intel NUC PCs before so I jumped on the chance to try one out.<br /><br />Form Factor:<br /><br />There's so much to like here!  First off, the form factor is TINY.  I included a picture; this basically sits in the palm of my hand, and I don't have very big hands.  From a power perspective, this means you're going to get an external power brick with the device, which probably adds 25% more to the size of the package all-in, but this can be stored away under your desk.<br /><br />Hardware:<br /><br />From the headline, you can see you get a Core i5, 32GB of RAM, and a 512 GB SSD.<br /><br />This has Bluetooth and WiFi built in (there's a very small antenna you screw in to enhance reception.), so no need for a CAT3 cable (though it has a port for wired network connections).  The WiFi performance was excellent; I was able to reach the full 400Mbps that internet plan allows for.<br /><br />In addition to the power cord, you get what appears to be a 2"" HDMI cable.  You also get a mounting plate which you can use to mount this thing in an array of other NUC PCs.  That's it - you need to supply all other peripherals, such as the keyboard and mouse.<br /><br />Since these are kit computers in a sense, I opened one up to see inside.  From the included picture you can see everything that can be swapped, specifically the new series of NVm.2 style SSDs.  I didn't realize it at first, but there's an entire tray at the bottom for a SATA SSD, and there's actually a removable slot that allows you to run a SATA cord from an external device IN to this device, so you don't actually physically need to put the drive in.  Very clean and straightforward insides here, they didn't try to cram everything in so there's airflow.<br /><br />Performance:<br /><br />This isn't going to be a performance review - I don't have the testing equipment and such to run any meaningful side-by-side comparisons.<br /><br />However, the Intel iRISx graphics card is decent - to give you a sense of what it has, the Nvidia RTX 3080 with 8GB I have in my gaming rig has about 3x the double precision processing power (among other things).  But that card cost more than this entire computer.<br /><br />From a gaming perspective the performance here is what I would consider to be ""nominal.""  I downloaded the Steam client on this and benchmarked Steel Division 2, which is the sort of game where you can really crank the settings depending on your hardware.  Again on my 3080, I can run the highest settings in every category on an ultrawide 49"" 1440p monitor.  With this PC, I had to run almost all the lowest settings, with several off, to play the same game at 1080p - but it was still completely playable.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a gaming rig, you're probably better off getting an XBox or a PS5.  But those two aren't computers, like this is.<br /><br />Other:<br /><br />Sound-wise, this is quiet but not silent.  My current gaming build - a NZXT 510 Elite with 4 fans and a PSU are actually quieter, but this is just a low-level whir, similar to what you'd get out of a laptop (except with better internal airflow).<br /><br />This PC does generate heat - even with good cool airflow nearby and the fans whirring, you can feel the ports in the back getting hot (indicative of internal temperatures).<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />I continue to be amazed by the offerings out there these days.  When I was younger, you had to have a huge tower to get this level of performance.  This is just like a big Alexa puck.  The form factor gives it all sorts of use potential beyond a simple desktop, while still allowing for plenty of expansion.<br /><br />From a price perspective, you really end up getting a lot (right now this item is listed at $780).  Considering you're getting an i5, plus 32GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, the only thing separating this from a higher end gaming rig is a discrete graphics card.  You also get a paid-up version of Windows 11.<br /><br />Very happy overall I was able to snag this product - I hope you find this review to be helpful!",1,False
4,Be very cautious with Intel's warranty,"This is a great processor when it works, it does run hot, but draws lower power than a non S processor. That being said, because it is an S processor, it is taken from batches that are lower quality than say a K processor, and will likely die shortly after the warranty expires. This is exactly what happened with mine, and Intel doesn't seem like a company that will work with customers a single day past that expiration. Mine was warrantied up to March of 2017, and it failed in June 2017. $300 is a lot to pay for hardware that can't live past 3 years.<br /><br />Update: They were reluctant at first to honor the warranty as it was a few months past...but after explaining the situation they did replace the broken CPU and now my PC works again. I'm very grateful that they did. I changed my rating again because they did that for me, usually big companies like this do not do it, I was very surprised. I will stay with intel for sure.",2,True

Going from 110 FPS to 125 FPS wouldn’t be noticeable for the majority of gamers. AMD still is behind Intel in clock speed and this cpu has virtually no overclock headroom so it cannot compete with the Now equally priced core i5-9600k in gaming. Just as the Ryzen 7 3700 cannot compete with the core i7-9700k. Sorry, but don’t believe the hype train. Facts are facts.

The box does not even tell you that when upgrading like I did, optane will not work if you are transferring your hard drive with Win 10 on it.  That is because Intel requires that CSM be disabled in the BIOS prior to install Win 10 from scratch.  So I have a board that I can't use optane with unless I reinstall windows and days worth of software not to mention a configuration nightmare that took a lot over time to get right.

4,Default Intel Fan MIght Have Surficed,"I bought this CPU fan thinking the boxed i7 ivy bridge CPU wouldn't include a fan.  I was wrong and now I realize the fan boxed with the CPU might have sufficed.  A review of this CPU fan compared with the included Intel fan stated similar.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007SZ0EOW Intel Core i7-3770K Quad-Core Processor 3.5 GHz 8 MB Cache LGA 1155 - BX80637I73770K]]<br />[[ASIN:B007G51UWY ASUS P8Z77-V LGA 1155 Intel Z77 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard]]<br />[[ASIN:B0026FCI2U Cooler Master HAF 922 Mid Tower Computer Case with USB 3.0 Ports (RC-922M-KKN3-GP)]]<br /><br />The fan takes up quite a bit of room on top of the motherboard as well as case space, but it does fit fine including with all memory slots filled.  As to whether it does a better job then the generic fan, I'm not too sure.<br /><br />Compiled a Gentoo system and see absolutely no overheating with this fan.  I think the HD4000 (Intel CPU graphics incl. in CPU) is running at 82F.  Much much cooler then a NVidia chip. As I tinker, I think the reason why I have such a low temperature is because of my very well ventilated case with three large fans.  A review on phoronix.com performing a comparison against AMD's chips using apparently stock fans and those tiny mini cases,reported 100-122F temperatures when rendering high frame rate games and benchmarking.<br /><br />Looking back at my boring non-overclocking past history with chips and hard drives failing every now and then, this fan definitely adds a little extra insurance.

You can buy an add-on fan for this video card as the heat sink only has two snap-pins holding it in place.  Zalman as well as several other manufacturers offer after market fans.  Take note, a Zalman fan might extend over the PCI port nearest the AGP card, preventing you from loading all PCI ports, although rarely done with PCI port #1 as this will share resources with the related AGP port on Intel 440BX boards.<br /><br />No lock-ups yet, but going into Winter here.

Please read the following information carefully as it may save you time and money. I hope the photos I provided make it easier to understand the fitment.<br /><br />My PC is a HP 510-p114 placed in service on 11.21.2016 so it has been running in services for just under 3 years.<br /><br />This CPU Fan was a perfect fit onto my Hamar MOBO which is fitted for the LGA 5100 Socket.  It comes with an adapter bracket which I did not need to attach this directly to my MOBO<br /><br />I have the Intel I7-6700T CPU chipset and the (blue screen) HP Error Code 90B (CPU Fan Problem) kept popping up upon reboot.  I came to Amazon looking for a replacement and found this.<br /><br />In photo 1 you can see the OEM Fan side by side with the new Thermaltake CLP0556-B which is the 4 pin version that my PC was designed to use.  You will note that the fastener layout and dimensions are an identical match to the OEM.  This CPU Fan is taller in height and has more mass to disperse heat from. You must make sure you have enough vertical clearance to accommodate the increased height.  You should also note that the new CPU Fan comes with a layer of Thermal Grease already applied and it is covered with a clear plastic bubble that you are to remove before installation.<br /><br />In photo 2 you can see the Thermaltake CLP0556 as installed in my unit. This took exactly 5 minutes to remove the old fan, clean the existing thermal grease from the CPU and install the new CPU Fan.<br /><br />In photo 3 you can see the cleaned/prepared CPU and its nomenclature.<br /><br />In photo 4 you can see the product details as printed on the box. It clearly states that this product has an expected life expectancy of 30,000 hours which equates to about 3-1/2 years if you run constantly as I do. I strongly suggest you keep that service life in mind so that you can proactively replace the CPU Fan before the end of its service life.<br /><br />After installation, I rebooted immediately and the PC was noticeably faster. I do not have an App to monitor the CPU Fan as some folks do, but I am quite sure that the OEM Fan was on its way out as I had noted a decline in performance for about a week before the 90B error code popped up.<br /><br />As a general suggestion to everyone, it is a very good idea to open your case on a regular basis and use canned air to blow all your fans clean as they do tend to accumulate dust which is counter-productive to long device life.<br /><br />I rate this product with 5 stars for an excellent fit and easy installation.  This vendor could do a much better job of being clear that this ad pertains to more than one CPU Fan. Hopefully the information I shared with you here will guide you to a successful solution.",31,True

No issues.<br /><br />I explored the included mini CD.  It has various tools and software.  I installed the Intel version of the driver and PROSet utility which enables nic teaming.

I just removed two screws, switched the brackets, reinstalled the screws.  I couldn’t use the supplied SATA cables as they were too short for the server in which I was installing the card into.  So I supplied my own extra long SATA cables in various colors.<br /><br />My only minor complaint is the orientation of the SATA ports on the card.  Because they are all oriented in the same direction, SATA connectors with locking tabs will interfere with the adjacent connector.  Not a big deal, it still works.  But this connector could have been engineered a bit better.<br /><br />When installed into a Windows 11 system, it was detected as a “Standard SATA ACHI” controller.  And that may work just fine.  But I wanted to use the vendor driver.  The product did not come with any drivers disk.  But I just Googled “ASM106xV3.3.5.0000_WHQL”.  Found the driver and set it up.

5,"This versitile, high quality charger delivers intelligently!","[[VIDEOID:ea2558c7538ec67768fc64970fab7ec8]] The charger that came with my HP Spectre X-360 13 was the standard HP 65 watt unit.  I added a USB Hub that is quite handy- the hub also carries up to 100 watts of power over USB-C, along with all my USB peripherals (wired internet, 2 USB drives, and HDMI cable to the big screen TV).<br /><br />While the standard power supply did fill all the power requirements, I felt a bit uncomfortable having all those additions powered by the smaller capacity HP supply- watts add up with every device.<br /><br />This ZTHY power supply provides 90 watts, and stays cooler than the original HP supply.  The design and parameters bespeak it's better quality than other less expensive power supplies I looked at, and I'm glad I chose this one.  I've read where others have used supplies that worked, but their HP computer complained ""Use an original HP power supply!""  I'm happy to report this supply caused no complaint from my Spectre at all.<br /><br />This is an intelligent supply!  I read in it's specs that it does 20 volts at 4.5 amps, 15 volts at 5 amps, 12 volts at 5 amps, 10 volts at 5 amps, 9 volts at 3 amps, and 5 volts at 3 amps.<br /><br />So, even though it's a ""20 volt"" charger, I plugged it directly into my Android phone- and it intelligently supplied the proper 5 volts instantly- and, it was ""Fast charging""!  (it didn't do ""super fast"" charging, but I have no complaints there.  The point is, you likely won't make an error no matter what USB device you plug it into- it handles all those voltage ranges properly.  Big plus.<br /><br />Demos of plugging it into both computer and phone are in the video.  One more feature I like very much-- the USB C plug end lights up when the power supply is plugged in... so the indicator light that it is indeed powered up is right in your hand.<br /><br />Lastly, as a laptop owner, it's really nice to have a power supply you can leave plugged into your ""pd power supply USB hub, and have a power supply you don't have to disconnect to take on the road with you.  By chance, that happened the very day it arrived.  Saved me a few minutes of effort I appreciated.<br /><br />With the quality and versatility, I think this power supply has been a good choice- and is likely to last much better than some of the bargain units I've seen.

5,Not just for Apple products and not just for Thunderbolt equipped (i.e. intel) computers.,"Recently purchasing a Windows 10 ultraportable, I was in need of a hub as my laptop does not have ethernet or audio jacks and has only a micro-SD card slot.  Most of the hubs designed specifically for Windows PC's are fairly pricey while most Apple accessories are dirt cheap.  Seeing this Ikling hub and others similar to it I was not sure how well this/they would work with my AMD Ryzen Windows laptop.  Not only is my laptop not iOS, it also does not have Thunderbolt USB-C ports as these are primarily promoted and provided on intel chip motherboards.<br /><br />I'm happy to report that all of the hub functionality I need works flawlessly with my Asus Zenbook.  Ehernet port is true gigabit. USB 3 slots show high speed transfer rates with my external SSD.  Heasdset audio works perfectly both for listening and speech.  SD card slots also seem to be high speed.  I have not tried the VGA connection and have no need for the HDMI since my laptop has an HDMI 2.0 port built in, so I have not attempted to verify those.  Charging with the PD connection also works well though the hub does get quite warm.  My only minor quibble is that I wish the connector was a little longer or ideally detachable<br /><br />So, if you have purchased an AMD powered Windows laptop with USB-C ports, this Ikling hub should work for you.

3,"Distorted, Bassy, Unintelligible Audio Mars Otherwise Excellent Product","Three stars: It's OKAY. I like this unit. It's not perfect. Cumbersome when worn--why does it need to stick out so far from the wearer's head? Why are the electronics located so low instead of integrated higher into the headband. And the big one--audio quality. Most reviewers that rave about the audio quality don't exhibit significant knowledge of this factor and use comparisons. The frequency response has a lot of bass--which contains very little intelligible information when listening to voice communications, books on tape, or using this with a laptop PC. That hump in the bass response results in clipping and distortion well below the maximum volume of this unit, making user have to choose between &#34;not loud enough and bassy&#34; and &#34;loud enough, but distorted and impossible to hear.&#34; For that reason I give it three stars.

5,Dell Optiplex 760 SFF paired with an Intel E6500,"First let me start off with my current PC: Dell Optiplex 760 Small Form Factor (SFF), Windows 7 32 Bit OS, 4GB RAM, Intel Pentium E6500 (Pentium Dual Core Wolfdale), WD Green HDD, stock Dell PSU (235W) and a Asus 24"" LCD running at 1920 X 1080 (native resolution).<br /><br />Originally I was using a Sapphire HD 4550 512GB GPU, would barely handle a lot of games and if I could run them it was at low resolution and lower settings.  So my search for a low-profile GPU began, I was first drawn to this GPU from some of the great reviews on here, saw that other Dell SFF users were using this GPU with success and since I had great luck with Sapphire products in the past and I did not really want to upgrade $$$ to a new PC currently, I decided to try it.<br /><br />GPU arrived, everything was typical Amazon super fast and I had it installed in less than 15 minutes, uninstalled the previous drivers prior to removal of my old GPU then downloaded the latest Catalyst Driver from ATI (AMD) site.  The GPU definatley fits the Dell 760 SFF well, no issues with clearance and it was nearly identical in dimensions to my old fan-less HD 4550.<br /><br />I first tried Crysis 2 and was able to raise the resolution to 1980 x 1080 and left the settings on High, was immediately impressed with the quality, basically night and day from my old GPU.  I did not mess around with lower the resolution and raising the settings (which might have been possible?) but may revisit it again.<br /><br />I then installed Metro 2033, was able to run the same resolution and settings on High, and using Fraps I was able to get around 35-60 FPS, nothing below 30 which is playable for me.  No real issues were noted, the GPU worked flawlessly. Dust particles were visible in Metro, which has quite impressive graphics. As with most cards equipped with fans, there is some fan noise associated with it when running, it does get quite loud but with good speakers or proper placement it's not an issue.<br /><br />Granted my CPU is being bottled-necked and these games are a few years old and whether or not I will be able to run Metro: Last Light or some of the newer games is a big TBD and I will have to update my review accordingly.  I plan on purchasing Last Light soon and will see how it goes.<br /><br />Overall I am impressed with this GPU and the ability of it to keep my dated system still usable for a little longer and saved me a lot of money in the process.  It works great with the 235W PSU, granted it might be at the limit but I have had no real issues to warrant me to be concerned with it.<br /><br />As well the $10 rebate wasn't bad and the process was quite easy, though my barcode on the box came with a sticker on it which partially covered the barcode, not sure why?  I removed it (carefully) and mailed the required documents with the form and etc.  I have not had a problem with rebates, but this is my first with an Amazon purchase.<br /><br />UPDATE 11/9/2013<br /><br />Tried running Metro: Last Light, results were not too great.  FPS dropped horribly down below 20 to as low as 15 in some cases, heavy graphic scenes, like the first chapter were too much even at lower resolution settings, lowering the graphics did not really improve it and quality was not acceptable.  The game is not playable on my system even with this GPU.  I got as high as 30FPS and that's it.  So it appears the older games work okay, but to run anything in the last year or so, a system upgrade will be required.  Does not mean this card is the issue, more of my CPU is so I still recommend this card and will have to start saving up for a new system build if I want to play the latest heavy system load titles.",1,True

The standard USB4 was specified and defined by the USB Implementers Forum in March of 2019 but has only recently seen use by equipment manufacturers. Prices have begun to drop as they are getting manufactured more. This high quality braided cover 4 foot long  cable which looks like a USBC terminated cable at each end except for the official USB4 Logo seen in Picture 2. This indicates a cable which is ""chipped"" to allow data transfer at up to 40 Gbps when it is plugged into equipment with that capability. That actually exceeds Thunderbolt 3 (T3) specifications and is backwards compatible and can be used with T3 equipment as well as all USBC equipment though speeds and capabilities will be dependent on the host.<br /><br />I tested it as the feed cable for my T3 Breakout laptop Hyperdrive Hub and it gave me full compatibility and capability. I also wanted this for the extra bit of length to go from the back of my desktop USB C Gen 3.2 connector to the front. The length was ideal and the cable allowed full speed transfers.<br /><br />This USB 4 to USB 4 cable supports USB-C Power Delivery for up to 100W host charging (Power Delivery 3.0 Standard) so is thicker to allow delivery of up to 5 amps at 20V (100 Watts).

5,Nice looking mid-price tablet with a higher-end Intel CPU,"There are so many tablet choices out there it can be hard to sort through them all.  At the high-end there are the iPads and Surface and at the low end a lot of Android tablets you’ve never heard of.  In this price point I would consider two options: name brand Android vs. Kindle Fire.  For kids I buy Kindle Fires, which have excellent parental controls.  For adults I suggest name-brand Android tablets which provide better performance and more flexibility than a Kindle Fire.<br /><br />Asus isn’t the only choice but it’s a good one.  They have a long term reputation for quality but tend to be a better value than the bigger name brands like Samsung.  I consider their quality on par with Samsung, well above Amazon, and step below Apple.  The quad-core Intel CPU far out performs anything you will find in a Kindle Fire and compares well against higher end Samsung ARM based tablets.  It does this at very low (~1.3GHz) clock speeds keeping leakage power loss to a minimum.  This uses a Moorfield platform SOC which includes the excellent Silvermont cores.  It’s a quad-core single threaded design. For graphics it has a PowerVR G6430 clocked around 450Mhz (same basic graphics found on the Apple A7 but a higher clock).  I would rate this as a “mid-tier” graphics core that will handle anything Android will throw at it, but it would be underpowered if this was a Windows tablet.  It fits with the price point but you will find better cores in higher-end Apple and Samsung products.<br /><br />I personally found the IPS screen to be excellent.  It’s not quite on par with the Apple Retina display but it puts my Kindle Fire HDX to shame.  I gave it to my kids and let them run a couple of their games and they had no issues with performance.  I think for the price you are getting a pretty good tablet from a well know manufacturer.  Minus catching a higher end Samsung on sale, I don’t think you’ll find a much better deal out there.  If you are shopping around for an Android tablet I would not hesitate to buy this one.",5,False

4,"Finally evolved into a top notch video monitoring solution after a year. The ""intelligence"" of its alerts still need development","Update 7/29/16 - The app has gotten better. The playback is much improved and the way motion events are sequenced has improved as well. I can say at this point that the Canary is an excellent device for passive monitoring, this is, if you want to check in on things ad-hoc or look back at what happened earlier in the day/week.<br /><br />As I've mentioned several times below it still is not effective as an active monitoring device, too many false alarms for a house with pets and windows. I took up Matt's (from Canary) recent offer in the manufacturer reply below and had a chat with him about some of my concerns. I learned that effective image recognition requires a tradeoff with security. Canary has chosen not to compromise at all with the latter meaning it is difficult for them to apply an effective 'learning' algorithm to the data available to them. I accept that trade-off, I would rather Canary not have unencrypted video on their servers to process. Still - they initially marketed the product claiming that this would be possible. They still offer functionality in the app where you can &#34;tag&#34; events as pet movements, sunlight etc. to &#34;help improve canary&#34;. This appears to just be a facade.<br /><br />For me this becomes a 5 star product when I can turn on alerts and know that if I receive one it is time to stop whatever I am doing. It needs to have the capability to know, without a doubt, that a person is in my apartment. Perhaps pairing the canary with additional sensors (photoelectric beam, door sensor etc..) could make it a more comprehensive and reliable system.<br /><br />I was encouraged by my chat with Matt, it sounds like they are focused on the right user issues and will continue to make this a better product. Upgrading to 4 stars<br /><br />Update 4/3/16 - There is still zero &#34;learning&#34; associated with this device. It will alert you for any motion like most other wifi cameras. The only &#34;intelligence&#34; they have added is a way to adjust the sensitivity. I guess this might help reduce some false alarms but it is impossible to find the sweet spot where it will always detect a person but not my dog or a moving shadow. And regardless, when there is lightning canary is convinced the whole room is moving and alerts even on the lowest sensitivity setting.<br /><br />The app still is terrible. The playback on Android is flawed and it won't let me fast forward in a clip. Occasionally I have had clips that are an hour long because there are lots of fast moving clouds (creating rapid light transitions) that create a sequence of motion events. It is impossible for me to jump to a point that I care about and I am forced to download the clip (which takes a really long time for an hour long clip) and then use my phones native player. Occasionally even with shorter clips that consist of two motion events it will refuse to ever transition to the play the second event. It is also a huge data hog. It easily chews through several hundred megabytes if you want to playback a couple clips (which you will always need to do to find a specific event since Canary tags so many false movements). I can stream youtube for hours without seeing the same data impact.<br /><br />My wife uses the iphone app. Same data issues and slightly more reliable playback. You can at least jump to a midpoint in the clip but she often runs to random playback errors as well. I can only hope that if there is ever an emergent situation where we need to review Canary footage that the apps will actually work. Keep in mind the apps are the only way to review Canary footage. There is no desktop/web client.<br /><br />To summarize: they seem to be doing very little to improve their product - Their only public release in the past 6 months paraded integration with Wink and Echo. I am sure those features makes their engineers feel warm and fuzzy inside but it does very little to improve their customer experience. See for yourself: [...]<br /><br />Update 9/30/15 - I never ended up returning this device due to the lack of strong alternatives.<br /><br />Original Review:<br /><br />I have had my canary for 2 weeks. I was very excited to have a easy to use and attractive apartment monitoring device. Here are the  issues I ran into.<br /><br />1. False Alarms - pets: I get alerts all day from my dog walking back and forth. I tag all of them as &#34;pet movements&#34; so the canary can &#34;learn&#34; but the frequency of these alerts has not decreased. My dog just does the same walk back and forth so it is not like it is a different movement every time. Somehow canary hasn't been able to learn<br /><br />Update 9/30/15 - The manufacturer has acknowledged that at this point zero device learning is occurring. Their website says &#34;Canary's algorithm-based motion detection learns over time to send you smarter notifications. The longer you have it, the more effective it becomes&#34;. right now that is a complete lie. Currently users are just providing data so Canary can eventually develop a learning algorithm. I am all for being a beta tester when it is presented as such. I've attached a screenshot of what happens to my phone when my Canary is armed on a day that my dog isn't even home. Each alert just shows the brightness shifting in the room.<br /><br />2. False Alarms - switch between infrared and camera: The canary has a great nighttime infrared mode which automatically switches to regular camera mode when the room is light enough, and vice versa. Whenever this switch occurs it will trigger a motion alert. If your device is armed all day you can count on getting at least 2 false alarms<br /><br />update 9/30/15 - this has mostly been fixed but I still get a couple alerts a week that consist of only an infrared mode shift.<br /><br />3. False Alarms - sunlight: Yesterday was a partly cloudy day so the sunlight was variable. my phone was getting alerts all day.<br /><br />4. Unreliable detection: After 10 days of false alarms I was excited to hear that my landlord needed to stop by my apartment while I was away. This was my chance to actually use my Canary! Well he stopped by, left a note on the counter, and left without my Canary sending a single alert. After he texted me that he has left I checked my Canary app and it was still armed and online. I got a dozen false alarms all day but no alert when someone was actually in my apartment.<br /><br />5. Unreliable device  - As I am writing this review I am out of town and my Canary app says &#34;Canary is offline&#34;. I know my internet is up because I can remote access into my home computer. Canary just randomly stopped working and there is nothing I can do about it until I am back home. This seems to be a frequent complaint in other reviews. It is tough to justify an investment in a security device that can just go dormant like this.<br /><br />Update 9/30/15: several times since I got the Canary it has disconnected and failed to reconnect. In these cases I have needed to restart the whole initial setup process to get it back online.<br /><br />6. Terrible App (Android) - air monitoring: The canary has all these great features where it can monitor air quality, temperature, humidity etc... well those features are completely useless because the app UI for it is broken. I emailed their support and they said they are aware of the issue and trying to fix it, but according to Gplay reviews this has been an issue for a while.<br /><br />Update 9/30/15 - The app keeps getting better. This specific issue has been fixed.<br /><br />7. Terrible App (Android) - bugs: overall the app crashes frequently when i try to replay all of my false alarm clips and sometimes loading the live feed just never happens.<br /><br />Update 9/30/15 - The app keeps getting better. The crashes occur much less frequently but the playback functionality is still extremely frustrating.<br /><br />8. No two-way audio - They seem to communicate this as a deliberate product decision to avoid associating any 'creepyness' with their device. It just seems like such a easy feature to add. When I go on the app and see my dog on the couch I would love to be able to yell at him.<br /><br />Overall I am bummed out that this product didn't work for me. The device is great! the camera/audio quality is excellent, the night vision is crystal clear, and the hardware just looks super slick. Unfortunately the intelligence and apps that support the device are half-baked. I would not recommend this to anyone in its current state.",844,True

3,00GHZ 8MB Intel Smart Cache LGA1151 (Skylake) -- 16 gb of DDR4 RAM ...,"I recently bought a $2000 CyberPower PC. I bought it from Cyberpower's Website as a custom build.<br /><br />Here's the specs:<br />-- Intel Core Processor i7-6700K 4.00GHZ 8MB Intel Smart Cache LGA1151 (Skylake)<br />-- 16 gb of DDR4 RAM 2133<br />-- EVGA GTX 1070 SC<br />-- Asus Z170 Pro Gaming Motherboard<br />-- 2 TB hard drive, with an extra 250gb Samsung 850 EVO M.2 SSD<br />-- 850 watt Corsair RMi Series RM850i Gold Power Supply, 10 Year Warranty<br />-- Corsair Hydro Series H60 120mm Liquid CPU Cooling System<br />-- Corsair Carbide 300R Gaming Case<br />-- LG 14X Internal Blu-ray Burner, BD-RE, 3D Playback DVD+RW Combo Drive<br />-- Gigabyte 802.11AC Wi-Fi up to 867 Mbps + Bluetooth 4.0 Combo w/ Dual Antenna PCI-E Adapter<br />-- Cyberpower Scorpion K1 RGB Mechanical Gaming Keyboard with Programmable Backlighting.<br />-- Windows 10 (64 bit)<br /><br />You get the idea. This is a machine that should be able to reliably run developments in technology, like VR, for at least the next five years.<br /><br />In short, from my experience I would say CyberPower offers a superior selection of customizable hardware at some of the most competitive prices, but their technical support is the worse of any company I have ever done business with.<br /><br />The good:<br />CyberPower built my rig with components that were sold out on New Egg, Tiger Direct, and Amazon at prices lower than any of them. Like the EVGA GTX 1070, which is the second most powerful graphics card even made. This was sold out everywhere when CyberPower built my computer with it, and they sold it at an honest low price. They offer all the top PC components for you to make your custom build with. I encourage you to compare their outstanding hardware options and respective prices with the suppliers I mentioned.<br /><br />You should investigate each component in the PC you are buying. Many other companies like Dell, HP, Asus are selling junk components with inadequate power supplies and RAM to increase their profit. Most of the other companies that sell custom built and VR PCs are total ripoffs with low-quality components.<br /><br />CyberPower also offers impressively easy to use customization on its website, which allows you to build your dream machine just the way you want.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />I tried to install an upgrade of 32 gb DDR4 RAM. But the PC would not run over 16gb, like it came, no matter what I tried. I emailed CyberPower tech support, and they didn't reply until three days after I emailed and wrote tickets on their website multiple times. When they did reply they just sent  me a link to some webpage I never heard of, telling me I don't need more RAM -- even though they sell well over 16gb of RAM in their custom builds on their site.<br /><br />I wrote them back asking for help on how to upgrade their PC. I asked if I could send the PC back for an upgrade since they advertise &#34;free upgrades&#34; on their website. It turns out their &#34;upgrades&#34; are just a misleading marketing ploy, and they don't provide upgrade service at all. After waiting almost a week for their next email reply, they actually sent me a link telling me how to determine what kind of motherboard is in the PC they sold me! LIKE I WOULDNT KN0W WHAT I SPENT $2000 ON! I included my order number, but they still didn't even know what hardware they sold me. Three days later they sent me a customer satisfaction survey asking how satisfied I was with their service as if they had resolved my case. I felt so insulted and was very angry at this point.<br /><br />I told them the ASUS Z170 supports up to 256gb of RAM, and asked for help as to if I had to make changes in the BOIS or something to enable the upgrade. I didn't hear back from them for two weeks after that! I was starting to think I was going to need to just send their PC back. But they replied and told me try reseting the motherboard back to the defaults in the BOIS. I was glad they finally said something that wasn't absurdly ignorant and offensive like everything else they told me until then.<br /><br />So I wrote back and asked for instructions on how to reset the BOIS to the defaults. I waited three days, but just gave up on doing the upgrade, and set my RAM chips back for a refund. The PC CyberPower sold me, does work well as it came. But I figure the last thing I need is to reset the BOIS to it's defaults and potentially create new problems, and extend this nightmare with CyberPower tech support.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />If you want to order a custom PC on the Internet, CyberP9wer is a great resource. But order exactly what you plan to use for the life of the computer. Save yourself a lot of trouble and don't even try to contact CyberPower after you get your PC, unless you need to send it back for a refund.<br /><br />Update:<br />I'm changing my rating from one-star to three-star after using my CyberPower PC for few a weeks.  It runs super fast and can handle anything put up to it.  It starts and shutsdown in three or four seconds like no other cumputer I've ever seen.  I'm really impressed with their computer.  I didn't have any of the problems the other reviewers mention.  If you order from their website, they give you a free CyberPower Scorpion keyboard with disco backlighting that is fully customizable, even to select the backlighting color for each individual key.  I'll just say this is by far the best PC I have ever owned.",4,False

4,CyberPower AVRG900LCD Intelligent LCD UPS System Has Saved Me A LOT of Headaches Over the Years.,"Power in my area has always been rather reliable. Unfortunately, I cannot say that for the last few years. Just this morning the power dropped out for a cool minute then flashed back on. One of the photo frames isn't attached to an UPS yet, and though the frame is fine several of the photo files are now corrupt from the sudden power outages and restores. I know this problem of failing power is only going to worsen as time goes by. As we have experiences several more abrupt off and on power issues this year alone. These interruptions can and do reek havoc is why I have been stepping up my purchases for additional UPS around the house.<br /><br />I recently purchased the CyberPower CP825AVRLCD Intelligent LCD UPS System from Amazon for an area where I needed a smaller unit. It now supports digital photo frames, home security cameras and a couple of small lights like the Himalayan Salt light. Of course, I have two of the bigger brothers 1500AVRLCDs which I've had a few years now also acquired from Amazon. The best feature I like about ALL three is the ability to disengage the audible sound. It can be most irritating especially during extended power outages.<br /><br />On the 21st of this near Fall September I ordered the CyberPower AVRG900LCD Intelligent LCD UPS System, 900VA/480W, 12 Outlets, AVR. This time NOT from Amazon because I found a much better price for the exact unit. It was purchased from another trusted company that I've had previous experience with, and I know they stand behind everything they sell, even offering price protection which is very rare these days. (Even if they reduce the price themselves.) Stellar!<br /><br />I was concerned this time buying the CyberPower AVRG900LCD Intelligent LCD UPS System, 900VA/480W, 12 Outlets, AVR because people were stating the alarm couldn't be disengaged or if so you had to perform action via CyberPower software. I never use the software this was disconcerting.<br /><br />As you see I didn't let reviews deter my purchase and now I have the CyberPower AVRG900LCD Intelligent LCD UPS System, 900VA/480W, 12 Outlets, AVR in hand it's been fully charged. On testing unit for setting it up in place the device functions as expected. It appears very solid like its big brothers and little brother. However, the LCD doesn't display alarm. Hmmm. I used the mode button depressing twice as done on previous models to no avail. Looking over the product guide it says to depress the POWER BUTTON TWICE QUICKLY to TURN OFF ALARM, ONE WILL HEAR TWO RAPID BEEPS CONFIRMING ALARM DISENGAGMENT. It works splendidly. Thanks CyberPower. The ALARM is my main reason for this brief review. The ability to disengage is still intact just performed slightly differently.<br /><br />Some reviews were highly obvious the purchaser wasn't informed prior to purchase how an UPS is to be used. Plethora of those individuals were apparently under the impression the UPS would sustain them until power was restored. Sadly this is NOT the case. It's to provide power buying you time to properly shutdown the computer system.<br /><br />Also, you don't buy the cheapest UPS, you buy based on power requirements. A 350 watt UPS will not function for a 700 watt device. If you look at the rear of your items it usually states the wattage needed to have it operate normally.  Always buy your UPS with the highest wattage support that fits your budget but two or three times or more than you think you need.<br /><br />I hope this review helps with your UPS purchase.<br /><br />DIGITAL SIGNATURE<br /><br />I close my reviews with a THANK YOU because I do appreciate you investing precious time in reading my material. We live in a complex complicated world where time is at a premium. I sincerely hope you found this review like my others informative and helpful in aiding your next purchasing decision.

5,Intelligible and crisp sound - look no further,"In the desire to upgrade my home theater on a fairly modest budget, I came across these speakers while looking through all of the available options for the budget I had allocated.  Having fond memories of the massive JBL speakers that cost an arm and a leg in the mid-2000's at a brick and mortar retailer, the inclusion of the same driver technologies in the ES825CBK and positive reviews from those who selected this speaker enticed me to give them a whirl.  I have yet to hear a speaker in this class and price range that exceeds the capabilities and performance of the ES line.  I'm using a 5.1 JBL ES-series setup with a Denon AVR-1612 receiver.  The overall depth of sound after the standard break-in period completely decimates a Jamo 5.1 setup that preceded these speakers. Regardless of source (Apple TV, Blu-Ray, Cable, etc), these speakers delivery clean sound with a very stylish and modern appearance to boot.  The sample images really don't do the design justice.  The capability to modify the angle at which the speaker is directed is included in the design, which really helps to enhance the sound stage if the center channel location sits lower than it optimally should.

4,"Intelligible speech, room filling sound","I bought the Coby CSMP88 in the hopes of significantly improving the ability to understand speech, especially movies, from our 46"" Sharp HD TV in or living room.  The TV sound is so inadequate that we use closed captioning a lot while watching programs.  Switching the sound thru our 14-year old Bose stereo system is also not that good.  Our floor plan complicates things.  It is a very open floor plan with a cathedral ceiling and multiple rooms adjoining with minimal dividing walls.<br /><br />When our middle-aged children were here last Christmas they complained they frequently had trouble distinguishing words.  This was without any prior comment from us.  Until then, we had been putting the problem down to our ageing ears.<br /><br />I thought the Coby unit would be worth trying after hearing Leo Laporte raving about it at the January electronics trade show.  When set to ""3D"", the sound and clarity are a significant improvement.  It fills the room with sound but not like surround sound--nothing sounds like it is coming from behind you.  As others state, when set to the ""Stereo"" setting the sound is flat.  I thought the 3D setting would be mainly for movies.  It is not.  Frankly, I don't know why you would ever set it to ""Stereo"".  Being able to connect an MP3 player or iPod directly to the unit is also a nice touch.<br /><br />The only disappointment involves positioning the unit.  The 21.5"" length and slightly less than 5.5"" height would allow it to fit in the cabinet niche where I intended.  However, two of the speakers are on the sides.  So, you have to place the unit in front of the TV or where nothing is close to the sides.  We find it sounds best by itself.  We have turned off the TV speakers.<br /><br />In summary, we have much more intelligible speech and richer overall sound without spending a lot of money.  It is not home theater level, but our floor plan is not conducive to that.",12,False

4,Practical use in an intelligent form factor.,"The best ideas are often the ones that combine widely used applications with a specific form that could benefit anyone who uses it without them even knowing they actually needed it.. Here we are. This multi-media device is good at everything it does but is most impressive for its brilliant form factor - a single piece, fold over design that clips on to anything you have on your person. HOTT's mp3 player carried my music (which sounded impressively good), pictures (which looked good enough to share in a pinch), and videos (that were acceptable enough quality if you've left your phone behind), all while being clipped onto my shirt, pants, jacket or anything thin enough to put a clip on. It's construction is solid and the built-in clip is flexible enough to accomodate thicker materials while being tight enough to clip a t-shirt without moving or falling off. It uses a simple interface that although basic, is easy to navigate and use on the go, separating all of your media on to individual pages which can be taken from your own SD cards. The process is simple and makes it even easier to use and to recommend. The included earbuds sound surprisingly good with a full stereo sound and rich bass to back it up. Charging was quick and card reading was seamless, making the only real issue the blue tooth pairing. It can be done, and most of the time it will pair easily, unless you've paired to another close device in which case you may need to unpair from your current host to make the connection... Small nitpicks aside, this is one of the smartest and most useful devices I've used in a while and if your a runner, gym goer, active home body, yard worker or participant in any other activity that allows small devices to play your music/pictures/videos through, then you couldn't do much better than this designer media player. Fleeting software issues and some pairing snags mostly won't detract from the suite of useful and well executed features packed into this clip on sidekick!",0,False
3,NOT INTEL BRAND - BRAND NAME = RUNING,"Has not arrived yet, but I have been reviewing my orders with anticipation and foolishly reading the reviews after ordering.  One reviewer mentioned that it is not Intel due to mATX size and checked against intel's documented releases.  However, the answer is more easily found by looking at the photos in the description.  The box displays ""runing"" as the brand name.<br /><br />[update] . Installed macOSX on it.  Runs fine (lol runing just fine).  I don't agree with the other customers who said it doesn't work.  It works fine and is a fun and cheap way to get a Xeon powered personal computer.  Good for mid-high end gaming and video editing.  My specs on my Xeon e5-2680 ($80) with this board are just higher than my i7-7700k ($329), so say what you will, this motherboard has some utility.

5,Great processor but don't shy away from the other Intel CPUs,"Installed the i7-8770K CPU, put the heatsink on, assembled the rest of the computer and loaded Windows 10. Nothing went wrong. Honestly, it is overkill for my use -- basic Internet searches, media server, some programming and desktop software. My motherboard uses the H370M chipset and 2666MHZ memory and Samsung EVO or PRO SSDs. I saw some CPU speed recommendations for a media server and bought this CPU as I didn't want to have to buy something else if a ""lesser"" CPU didn't work out.<br /><br />I used the built in graphics (UHD 630) for a while and it is very good for low-intensive graphics use. Then I added a low profile GTX1050Ti  (was curios) and was impressed and then added a GTX1060 in another computer (still curious) which is even more impressive. With my lack of gaming skills I cannot put any graphics to a test so I downloaded some demos from NVIDIA which allow you to pan and zoom around the scene.<br /><br />I have the i3-8350K in another build and it works great for what I use computers for. So, while this i7-8700K is fantastic and may be what you need for a great media server or workstation I recommend investigating other processors using a User Bench Mark site and see how they stack up for gaming, desktop or workstation use and then decide.  8th generation i3, i5 or i7 are great from bench mark comparisons and two actual purchases.",0,True

4,"Have an 8th/9th gen Intel CPU, a micro atx case and want to overclock? Not many options.","My current PC build is about 15 months old. I wanted something more compact this time around so I went with a mATX case. I got an i7 8700k but ended up getting a Asus B360 gaming motherboard as options were few at the time. This meant no overclocking in me despite having an unlocked CPU. I waited and waited hoping to eventually have a plethora of choices that would allow overclocking. 15 months later the options haven't improved much. So I picked up this MSI motherboard here on Amazon in excellent condition. The details said there was no manual but to my surprise everything was there. I'm now running at 4.9ghz with zero issues. Haven't tried to go beyond that yet. I'm using a thermaltake riing 280 AIO. This is a decent motherboard. It's not what I would call premium though. My biggest complaint is the wifi/bluetooth antenna connections are in the middle of the I/O so if you orient the antennas vertically they block a considerable portion of your I/O ports. Other than that everything seems to work fine. I like the bios better than my Asus board as well. The RGB lighting on this board is negligible and shouldn't be a factor in your purchase. It does however have 4 RGB headers (2 3pin, and 2 4pin) connectors which is excellent. Just remember, if you're going mATX then this board is your best bet.",2,True

Well, I decided to invest in Retro video game systems and here I am writing this review. I'm using this on my hobby desk and I was expecting what you usually get with a product such this. However, what really amazed me is the intelligence of this device. I have my Satelite, 3 gaming consoles, and my Netbook hooked up to this hub. If I'm watching tv but want to play a game on one one of my consoles, all I need to do is turn on the console and this hub picks up what I'm doing and switches it automatically for me to the device I turned on! Then, once I turn my console off the hub switches back to my satellite! How cool is that? It's a simple feature that I didn't know existed. It's like the remote is kind of pointless since does all the changing for you! I am highly impressed by this hub.  Will recommend here and to my friends and family.",55,True

5,"Beautiful Camera, Intelligent and fast","The camera is beautifully constructed. High quality materials with stylish finish, and contours. Attention has been given to make the camera stand out from countless other competitors in this segment. As an example, as you will see in the product photos, the dial button to select different photo modes is at an angle, I really liked this, very ergonomic.<br /><br />I won't again repeat the camera specifications here, that's already given in detail in product description. I will try to say how good the camera really works with those specificatons.<br /><br />The 15x wide angle zoom lens is absolutely working as advertised. There is very low angle distortion on the corners on the 24mm wide angle, and it's amazing how that can be achieved in compact cameras.<br /><br />The EXR technology mode, when selected from the dial button, automatically adjusts all settings by various sensors. I found it really technically amazing to see how the various icons and settings changed when I used camera in different situations and pointed at different places. It is very fast to sense and change. Face detection, red eye reduction, everything works, and is fast. The camera is also very fast to turn on and be ready to take photos. I am using a 4GB SDHC card. Camera focuses very fast.<br /><br />The image stabilization works like any other camera these days, and is good. I did notice high ISO behavior that was not excellent, but for that you need DSLR, from compact camera, this is comparable to other cameras in this segment. The flash works properly, my only gripe is that whenever camera is on, it pops up and cannot be forced down. This may become ok after some usage as you get used to it, not a show stopper for anyone I think.<br /><br />The camera LCD works as advertised, bright in daylight and low light, vibrant, and the icon resolutions are also nice, sometimes manufacturers make really bad icons and UI elements, but this one is good.<br /><br />I am no expert in photography, but it's got all the bells and whistles and all the different modes in all cameras these days. Stand out is the EXR mode which I really like, that auto adjuts all settings and selects different scene modes also. The scene mode selection is really accurate, I was amazed.<br /><br />Low light photography can be better, I have seen Canons and Sonys take better low light photo, in low light I noticed some graininess and less vibrance. But that may also be because I am not using the proper settings. It's not bad, but not the best in the segment. Again, not a show stopper at all.<br /><br />I also liked the Panorama mode to shoot upto 360 degree photo. It worked without much practice, after trying one or two times. Just keep button pressed and move around, trying to keep camera a bit steady along a line it shows on the LCD. Not difficult.<br /><br />I really liked the camera, it is different than others, stands out, people have asked me about it and liked it.

5,MacBook Pro 2019 Intel i7 connectivity in Portrait View,"I just got this Dell monitor to use with my late 2019 MacBook Pro 16 inch and MacOS Monterey, i7 intel, base model computer.  The computer has all USB-C ports so I wanted to see if a USB-C monitor would work..  I unboxed this monitor and attached the stand without tools in 3 minutes.  The stand DOES go to a full portrait view, which Is how I use the monitor.  When in portrait, the plugs for AC, HDMI, USC-C, etc are on the right side as one looks at the monitor.<br /><br />I plugged in the monitor power cord.  I turned on the monitor, and it asked me what language and if I wanted to use the USB-C port as a charging port; I answered ""yes"" by pushing a button on the monitor.  I then plugged the USB-C male-male cable supplied with the monitor into my MacBook Pro, and into new monitor. Immediately I heard the chime that the macbook was charging, and the lightning symbol was over the battery icon. Boom, within 15 seconds the monitor fully recognized the Macbook and displayed it's image..  This is with using only the USB-C to USB-C cable between the Macbook pro and the monitor; I did not use any HDMI input.<br /><br />In System Setting on the Mac, I rotated the image so that I could use the new monitor in portrait view, and then I tested the sound through the monitor's speakers. The Dell speakers are not even close to the exceptional sound of the Macbook Pro, so i do not use the sound through the monitor.  I tested the camera, which is fine, about the same as my MacBook pro.<br /><br />So, bottom line, I like the one cable to monitor from my MacBook pro, and that it charges the MacBook Pro while using it so i dont need a separate charger hooked to the McB Pro.  I like that it was basically plug-n-play for my set-up.

5,"Extreme flexibility, intelligent & efficient choice of functions.","Incredibly, this one small hub provides incredible flexibility. It has 5 USB ports—more than any hub I’ve ever had (2 are USB 3). It has an HDMI port which, while I don’t really need it, is still nice to have. It has a port for those tiny little memory cards inside your phone.<br />But the absolute clincher for me are the two memory card slots. My camera shoots with two memory cards (one for RAW and one for jpgs). I can insert both in and Bridge will access them. I can decide if I need to process the RAW or just go with the jpeg without plugging in and out.<br />I’ve made two observations that differentiate this hub from others I’ve had:<br />1) If I have it plugged in to a/c power, the hub can run my 4TB external hard drive. In the past, I’ve always had to use the USB port in the back of the CPU so that that drive would be directly connected to the motherboard. Otherwise, I’d lose the connection to the drive. Needless to say, it also runs the 40 GB external I use for Photoshop scratch disk.<br />2) While I don’t have a scientific way to measure this, charging of appliances such as phones and i-pads appear to be MUCH faster than when charging from an adapter connected to a/c power. I went from 18% charge on my phone to over 45% in just minutes. Presumably, appliances that don’t have a gauge to tell you percentage would also charge faster.  Given that so many random appliances now come with USB charging, this will be increasingly important and the 5 USB plugs increasingly useful. While I never really noticed a difference between USB 2 & USB 3 I do notice a pick up here.<br />Also, it seems to me that having several of the plugs in use does not slow the hub down. Ex: two 64 GB cards open in Adobe Bridge, the external hard drives, and a couple of the USB plugs charging something—the hub still appears to be working at full capacity. Again, how would I measure this? It’s a purely anecdotal observation but it seems to be true. I have gotten a bit spoiled by this instant gratification.<br />While less expensive options might be available, it would be hard to find the flexibility and dependability of this unit. It doesn’t hurt that it’s all metal, seems extremely well built, is compact, installs instantly, and—let’s face it—it’s downright attractive to boot.",10,False

I can just look in through the side of my case and see if the fans are still running. Runs quiet too!<br /><br />I recommend this cooler for a non-dellidded I9 cpu and whatever else it fits.  It completely cleared my RAM and I have a large case with fans blowing in and sucking out.<br /><br />I thought it might be heavy on my motherboard but running as cool as it does it is not too heavy and the mounting system seems completely stable and solid.<br /><br />I do not plan to overclock my CPU... It is not worth possibly damaging a $1000.00 processor even if it does stay below critical temps.. Lots of RAM and dual (non overclocked) 1080ti graphics cards will provide me with the headroom I need while keeping things cool and stable on the processor end.<br /><br />The performance of this product far surpasses my expectations! Some complain about the look of this cooler but I prefer function over fashion.<br /><br />Buy it, (and the thermal pads) they are worth very single penny.",0,True
4,True bargain performance character in the Intel Core i3 4360 (factory 3.7 GHz) fifth generation Haswell processor.,"The Intel Core i3 4360 is a fifth generation Haswell processor for the Land Grid Array (LGA-1150) socket.  This product requires a main logic board with an Intel Z-97 chipset ""if the user desires to have no compatibility issues.""  There will be surprises because the electrical characteristics are ever so slightly different from the fourth generation Haswell.  Matter of fact-- this processor actual operates slightly cooler and slightly faster than the older Core i3 dual-32bit core processors.<br /><br />  Since last year purchase of laptop with a mobile Core i3 dual-32bit core 4200U (factory de-clocked to provide better power consumption), wanted to test a desktop version to determine whether this would be the price-performance balance for the economy assembly of a ""Reliable Bargain Computer System that can run any computer operating system.""  The power requires for this processor is phenomenal. Though not fast enough for recreational / gaming duties, it will perform well with a dedicated Evga GeForce GTX-770-SC ACX dual cooling fans (4 GigaByte of GDDR-5 dedicated graphics memory, cost US$259 at Amazon.com) video controller allowing a reasonable frame rate with modest game settings.<br /><br />  With the dedicated video controller removed and using just the Intel embedded graphics controller and ""shared"" one Giga Byte of DDR-3 main logic board memory the processor is able to do everything that a normal computer system is used for academia, commerce, internet access terminal, kiosk, etc.  But not PC gaming.  For dual-32bit core (allows running 64bit operating systems) this processor is able everything else quietly and economically.  And with a Corsair Hydro Series H60 single fan sealed Liquid Cooling System a computer system with a Core i3 4360 would run reliably run 24/7/364 all year long.<br /><br />  Did not consider the lessor cost Intel processors as they did not have the price-performance incentive.  As for the ""wee bit faster"" (yeah a 0.1 MHz faster) Core i3 4370 selling for more cost and generating more heat, is not a good cup of tea.  Thus found a happy medium for most computer users-- capable General Use computer processor that is affordable and with a dedicated video graphics controller above, the user would have an economic multimedia player.  An excellent modern ""Thin Client"" running modern 64bit computer operating systems.  Its all about choices and this product contributes the heart of robust processor that does not require any over-clocking.  From the factory its already runs at 3.7 Giga Hertz.  Note: There is little to be gain from 3.7 Giga Hertz to 4.4 Giga Hertz because there are only two 32bit cores and only four threads.<br /><br />  Now at the extreme opposite end... having an 8 x 32bit cores with 16 threads the user begins to see some real life performance gains from 4.0 Giga Hertz to 6.0 Giga Hertz with the typical I/O timing issues, there still would be only a few percent points net gain.  Therefore this processor is a bargain considering that for most users this is an economy product that will perform well with mainstream applications.  Computer games, audio-visual creation, simulation editing are all non mainstream as these kinds of software programs saturates the computer system all around.  Then users should consider purchasing an Intel Core i7 4970K, or AMD FX-8390 processors.",5,False
5,Corsair Hydro Series H110 is  the best two cooling fans Liquid Cooling System for extremely over clocked Intel 4790K processor.,"The Corsair Hydro Series H110 is designed in Denmark and manufactured in China.  This is the best two cooling fans sealed Liquid Cooling System for an extremely over clocked Intel Core i7 4790K processor in the computer market.  It has efficient 90+ cubic feet per meter airflow.  It has appropriate nine centripetal vanes and the obligatory fluid bearing hub for longevity of the fan assembly.  The Corsair Hydro Series H110 and H90 are the only two products available with Fluid Bearing lubricated fans. And Corsair H110 has twice the heat radiator length of the Corsair H90.  The minor wind noise is very acceptable.  Have done the research, testing, and assembly.  If user must push the Intel 4790K beyond 12 Giga Hertz, its possible just not with Liquid Cooling systems.  User shall want the ""Electro-Magnetic Cooling System"" which has no refrigerants, no hoses, no fans, and no heat sinks!  (Warning: That will certainly void the warranty with Intel.)  The Canadiens and Australians (USA lead) are working on that magnetic cooling gizmo, and do not hold your breath.  The Corsair Hydro Series H110 is truly the best cooling option for an extremely overclocked Intel 4790K at 7.3 Giga Hertz (briefly).  Dare not go any higher as the electrical characteristics must support the on board Serial Attached SCSI controller when used as a 24/7/364 Application Server Computer.  May your overclocking be as stable.  Hint:  Its a 60 inch tall tower case with room for 16 x 140mm fans and more.  User shall note that the H110 radiator (280mm length x 140mm width x 25mm depth) requires a 280mm radiator mounting pattern, or a dual 140mm side by side fan pattern to mount the radiator at the top of the ""extra tall"" full tower case.  Remember to add the depth of the cooling fan which is 29mm.  Therefore the necessary distance to clear any obstruction is at least 60mm from obstruction to the surface of the mounting area.  Must use a full tower case where the power supply mounts at the bottom of the case.  The Corsair Hydro Series H110 is compatible, reliable, efficient, and above all simply works.  There are no main logic board UEFI issues, no PWM nonsense, no operating system crippling, and no power supply compatibility problems.  If user must do over clocking, remember only Electro-Magnetic Cooling can respond quickly enough to avert ""cooking"" the silicon during the event.  All other methods of cooling the processor is ""post effect"" and will not address the ""cause"".",0,False

Have done the research, testing, and assembly.  Reliably able to repeat experiment up to 6.3 Giga Hertz, dare not go beyond that as other main logic board components are not designed to operate at that speed.  Remember your basic electronic sinusoids... frequencies added to voltage always affects stabilizing elements and filtering elements on a given circuit.<br />Therefore this is the best single fan Liquid Cooling System for moderate overclocking.  And it also always help to have a 48inch tall tower case with proper ventilation.  Avoid the mid size and smaller sized full tower cases.  User shall note that the radiator will take up all the mounting holes of a 140mm pattern.",5,True

Got it all back together, sat down and pushed power on.  Nothing.  I forgot to turn the power supply back on when I reinserted into the case.  Whew.  Power on again and nothing.  I had knocked the power cable off the internal SSD drive.  Pressed start again and it booted but the graphics were the same.  I had forgotten to boot into BIOS or whatever they call it these days, and select my new video card.  Did that, pressed power on for the fourth time and magic!  I'm so glad I did this.

Some genuine Intel features, but also questions.","There are several of these ""VESA"" (back of monitor) mini PCs on the market and it was interesting to see that Intel was selling their own as well.<br /><br />Or are they?  The text reads ""We are the only Amazon direct store in the world for intel NUC. All products sold from 「Next-Gen PC Shop Store」 will automatically receive a three-year free warranty service from intel's original factory from the date of order.""  So maybe it is a directly authorized reseller.<br /><br />Why does that matter?  (1) Security for BIOS updates.  (2) Testing for power saving, hiberation and sleep modes.  (3) Reliability of USB ports.  (4) Performance of memory staging between the SSD and main memory. (5) Intel drivers for networking - e.g., vs. Realtek<br /><br />There's no guarantee that the Intel unit is better performing, but in my experience their packaged systems tend to be better tested.

5,"Impressive performances, wipe the floor with Intel i9","I have been using AMD in the old days, when I was a student and could not afford to buy Pentium 4, so AMD was my go-to CPU because it was cheaper. Then I moved to Intel and used it for almost a decade, until now.<br /><br />I don't really care about brands; I just buy what is more convenient, so my point of view is purely on the usability, not on the brand-loving fanboy perspective.<br /><br />Got this 3900XT and compared it to my previous 9th gen i7 CPU, and it just smoked it; being a generation behind, the I7 did pay the price of being ""older"" and hotter; also the core count is unfair, being a 4 core vs 12. So I grabbed an i9 I use for work; and the 3900XT smoked that one too.<br /><br />Overall performances are pretty close in most cases with the i9, so it is not a matter of raw power; but the smaller AMD architecture helps a lot with performances since the CPU gets much less hot. Using just a simple Noctua fan+ cooler, so nothing fancy, I get an average of 50-60 Celsius while using the computer (you do not need a liquid cooler, I have this computer on night and day and for the past week it never peaked beyond 88 Celsius, with games or rendering in Blender); it is incredibly quiet and that helps with noise levels too.<br /><br />In some cases, the i9 did score by a 5-7% lead for some tests, but other than that, the 3900XT did match or pass the i9, at a much lower price point and heating up much less than the i9, so that is a win.<br /><br />If you use a computer not only for gaming, but for music production, 3d modeling and rendering, Photoshop, video editing and such; then this CPU is probably the best you can get on the market, without going to a server grade CPU like the threadripper or Xeon. Just remember that the 9 series of Ryzen does not have a Vega GPU integrated, so you must buy a GPU. I have an ATI RX which is a perfect match for it, and can't wait to see what this CPU can do with the new GPU cards coming from Nvidia and ATI.<br /><br />5 out of 5 stars so far; it is worth its price for sure; unless you just play games; in which case, you can get a 5 series or an i5, which are equally fitting for the job, and more useful for just gaming.",8,True

If I did it again, I could do it in about 20 or 25 minutes.  I also bought the ""Kaisi Precision Magnetic Screwdriver Set Electronics Repair Tool Kit"" on Amazon for $20. I used the T5 torx screwdriver, the phillips screwdriver and the plastic pry bar. There were about 10 torx screws on the back of the laptop. I used the plastic pry bar to help pry the top of the back cover.  There was one phillips screw holding the old wifi card. There is 1 black and 1 white antenna wires (remember the wire color order). You pull them up (not slide them out). You slide out the old wifi card and pull up and off the antenna wires. Install the new wifi card. I recommend watching a YouTube video first so you get comfortable with it first.<br />  I also then plugged my laptop into an internet ethernet cable using an adapter into my USB C port on my laptop (to make sure the laptop could go fetch the Intel 8265 drivers). It automatically recognized the new Intel wifi card and installed the drivers. Then I took the internet ethernet cable out and the wifi was working. I had to re-add my bluetooth mouse and my bluetooth intuos wacom tablet.

I was getting some strange things with that external usb wifi like my usb ports would stop working and my laptop would get caught in a boot logo mode in which I had to use system restore to get out of the boot loop frozen logo. Then I decided, it was time to install this $25 interal Inel 8265 wifi card instead. It now works great. This $1,000 Lenovo laptop needed this new $25 Intel wifi card to work properly.

5,Excellent sound...intelligent design.,"I expected good sound from other reviews, but the sound on the included headphones is nothing short of excellent! As good as any phones I currently own, including a pair of in-ear Shures that cost over twice what this whole package cost. And I really like being able to plug in other phones and use them via bluetooth with my Kindle Fire HD. Sometimes I like to use over-ear noise canceling phones (also Sony) when piano practice is going on in the living room, and they work great with this bluetooth receiver.<br /><br />The controls, necessarily tiny on this tiny device, work well. I like the touch-slide volume. It is easy to clip the device securely to a pocket or collar.<br /><br />All in all...just what I was looking for. Actually exceeded my expectations.",1,True
5,Intelligent and quick - simply amazing,"We have owned (and still own) two other Pentax compact cameras: an Optio 60 and an Optio P60. We have fallen in love with the simplicity of the menus, the quality of the photos, and the incredible battery life of the E80. This camera is so intelligent and quick that it is simply amazing. Even low light pictures, macros, and photos of fast objects come out looking spectacular. This camera offers performance which you would have paid $300+ for only a year or two ago. The small size means it fits in shirt pockets or pants pockets easily. We don't even keep track of battery life because basic rechargeable AA batteries last a very long time in this camera. We are so thrilled with the Optio E80 and we can see this coming along on every vacation, to every party, and to every special event where a bulky camera is not needed.",4,False

4,"Great entry Intel CPU - Runs Hot, Costs More",Put this on my wishlist years ago when Intel was still the front runner on cpus and bought a supporting mother board early on in my planning. This locked me into the Intel chipset when I finally bought it this year. While it does great while multitasking - under load it does run hot and having to buy your own cooling unit is a huge downside. If you are looking for cpus in 2020 I would do more research into AMD as they are going toe to toe with Intel now for a much better price point.,0,True

5,"The drive is great, but what's interesting is that Intel is also a price leader.","Intel is now a price leader in the 5-year warranty consumer space. This drive was (at Amazon's introductory price) almost the same price as the Samsung 840 Pro 128GB (before provisioning). Intel was giving 50% more space than the Samsung 840 Pro for nearly the same price. Even with the higher price, it's still a better deal per GB than the Samsung 840 Pro.<br /><br />I have 5 SSDs on my personal computers. 3 of my 5 SSDs are Intel, my other 2 are Samsung 840 (Pro and non-Pro) drives. I have an Intel 330 120GB and 2 of these new 530 180GB drives. Synthetic benchmarks can show the advantages and disadvantages of all my different drives, but for all practical purposes, I can't tell the difference in my daily use. My backups show a small difference, but since my backups are automated weekly, it doesn't make any difference.<br /><br />Both Intel and Samsung have excellent software packages.<br /><br />Reliability and price rule my choices. Since flash drives wear out through the process of programming and erasing cells, and use wear-leveling to make the drives last longer, I did a search for these statistics.<br /><br />A simple search of the reviews of my various drives shows my SSD's different program/erase (p/e) cycles. This is what I found:<br /><br />Samsung 840 ~ 1,000 p/e cycles;<br />Samsung 840 Pro ~ 3,000 - 5,000 p/e cycles;<br /><br />Intel 330 ~ 3,000 p/e cycles;<br />Intel 335 ~ 3,000 p/e cycles (I don't own this drive, but included it for comparative purposes);<br />Intel 520/525 ~ 5,000 p/e cycles (I don't own either of these drives, but included them for comparative purposes);<br />Intel 530 ~ I couldn't find any numbers on p/e cycles, but I would expect the drive to have between 3,000 - 5,000 p/e cycles.<br /><br />I wouldn't be surprised if Intel is having difficulty keeping up their 520/525's 5,000 p/e cycles benchmark on the 530; Intel's 520/525 uses 25nm NAND and the 530 uses 20nm NAND.<br /><br />I haven't seen any reports of Samsung moving to sub-20nm NAND, but Micron (Intel's partner in flash memory) has reported that IMFT (Intel Micron Flash Technologies) is already moving to 16nm production as I write this. I doubt if Samsung can keep up with Intel's semiconductor process technology; the Samsung 840 (non-Pro) uses TLC (triple level cell) NAND, and is already at 1,000 p/e cycles.<br /><br />Although my Samsung 840 and 840 Pro have class leading controllers in the consumer space, the 840's (non-Pro) durability remains hugely questionable given that it's rated at 1,000 p/e cycles; I use this drive on my 85 year old father's computer -- he only uses his computer to browse the internet, and Win8 only uses about 35GB of space.<br /><br />Samsung has a notorious customer service record. Even now, recent reviews on the Samsung 840 Pro show that there are plenty of conflicting reports on whether the 840 Pro has a 3-year or a 5-year warranty -- Caveat Emptor (let the buyer beware), especially on the Samsung 840 (non-Pro) drive.<br /><br />While Samsung may find it difficult to scale it's NAND process technology lower, consumers are benefiting from Intel's lower prices.",178,True

5,Much better than the OEM Intel fan,"Needless to say the originally installed Intel fan started to make noise as the bearings were shot. With that, I looked over a few different fans and besides being more robust with a larger heatsink, it also sports a backplate where the fan screws into. The stock Intel has the worst plastic push and turn pieces imaginable. I know some people have knocked the backplate---- but honestly it is the best way to go--- you know it is attached and tight against the processor. With that said, I only had to remove the top two screws from the motherboard to the case and loosen one more--- I slid in the backplate, and put it back together. Cake to do. What is also a nice touch is the heat transfer compound is already in place and no need to add any more--- this was also well received.<br /><br />As far as sound level, it is fine. About 20-25% quieter than the stock Intel fan and will definitely work better as the heatsink is bigger. Will it make a difference in system performance-- probably not for what we have, but I do have to say that quieter is always better. Other than that it only had three wires versus my motherboards 4-pin connector (and the old fan had 4-pins) and by lining up the tab on the connector--- all works perfectly.<br /><br />For the price, I can never complain as long as it live a respectable life. Would I recommend it? Yes. Am I ready to buy another one for another similar system? Yes I am.<br /><br />12/2012--- I just picked up a second one as I re-purposed the machine. The OEM Intel fan in this machine was in much better shape, but still not perfect. Again, I had to loosen the motherboard screws to slide the backplate in, but overall it was cake to install. I like the design for this particular processor.",0,True

3,ER-X a Good Intellectual Challenge.,"This is a very interesting Advanced router and I mean advanced.  If you're looking for a simple plug 'n play router, this is not for you.  It requires a lot of experience with networks and routers in order to wind your way through the maze of amazing details available to you.  And it appears that the UBNT website has a plethora of documentation and support forums to help somewhat.  The main user manual is over 100 pages for this little device.<br /><br />First off, the item I received was not new!  The box seals were not intact, the power brick cable tie was not in place (but was loose in the box), and there was no quick start guide which is essential for starting this device and learning how to do resets which I needed to do; fortunately the UBNT web site had all the documents I needed.  Otherwise there were no signs of apparent misuse of the device.<br /><br />Initial setup requires a static IP address be set on the computer to talk to the ER-X.  Initially I could still not talk with the ER-X and did several hardware resets.  I even had to tweak the static IP address to finally connect to the ER-X.  Once initially connected but before configuring, I tried to update the firmware to the latest release...and discovering how to do it was a nice learning adventure...but once updated, I had the same problems in connecting to the ER-X as before until I again set a low static IP address needed for initial configuration.<br /><br />The box itself appears well made and it has surface mounting capability...something I very much like and something many routers no longer provide.  The ability to do a lot of tweaking of NAT, DHCP, Firewall, ports, etc. is most powerful and a nice challenge to extend networking experiences; it even provides an option for multiple subnets.  And no wifi, but I don't like router and wifi in the same box...I prefer separate especially for the gateway device which this appears well suited for.<br /><br />Right now it appears to be a good buy - and a good intellectual challenge.",2,True

Asus and EVGA might add a few more features, but I always buy from Intel for one reason:<br /><br />BIOS support.<br /><br />Intel makes the motherboards, reference designs, chips and CPUs that everyone else uses.  Accordingly they write all the BIOS fixes as they come along.... then Asus etc. validate and release those (if they want and have the money available, think about that for a second).  If you are on an Intel branded board, you always get every BIOS fix, everytime, as soon as it comes out.<br /><br />Asus and other brands have outright refused to fix stuff that was fixed on Intel boards many times....  These fixes are there, just Asus hasn't had a big enough customer demand it.  Intel's customers are Dell and HP so they MUST fix ALL problems.<br /><br />Intel boards come out a little earlier, so sometimes you may get a bleeding edge problem if you choose to buy a brand new board.... but the difference with Intel is: you KNOW they will fix it.<br /><br />Since I started buying Intel....  I've seen many noobs complain of no boot on a product that's been out 1 week and they haven't flashed the BIOS or make a pilot error about how to do it (there are 5 ways you can try with this board)...  but I've NEVER had an Intel  board with a problem that didn't get fixed.... which has happened with Taiwan brands many times over the years, and I've been doing this for 20 years.<br /><br />This board is a top of the line choice with 2nd and 3rd gen Core Intel CPUs, its got<br />- a great UEFI BIOS with mouse support and automated overclocking,<br />- onboard hybrid hardware / software RAID,<br />- actual high quality Intel (not cheapo) Gigabit Ethernet,<br />- comes with integrated Motorola Bluetooth and a VERY good RAlink Wifi N adapter,  (these come on a USB adapter pod / antenna you attach to the inside of the case, very smart design and very good performance)<br />- dual USB 3.0, black 3.5 inch external bay adapter with 20 pin motherboard cable<br />- and Dolby surround with every connection you can think of<br /><br />don't listen to fanboys trying to imitate experts and whining about Intel boards because they didn't know what they were doing, Intel doesn't deserve that.... this is a good product. enjoy<br /><br />NOTE:<br />I've loaded UEFI on windows 7 on these boards without a problem many times, but you will need to modify the DVD or USB image you are installing it from as MS did not enable UEFI install by default<br /><br />the easiest way is to use the MS usb install tool with a 4gb or greater USB and make an install USB<br /><br />in the \efi\microsoft\boot directory. Copy this directory one level up so the files also reside under \efi\boot.<br /><br />Copy the bootmgfw.efi file to \efi\boot, and rename it to bootx64.efi.<br /><br />boot the USB and it will install on UEFI fine... of course make sure you have flashed the newest BIOS first.",54,True
5,Excellent budget memory for Intel too!,"Due to having a good friend that is an Intel employee, I decided to go with Intel on my new build since the value is there at the employee discount price, otherwise AMD is awesome right now, and this memory is awesome for either! My z390 board easily recognized these and I just had to change to the XMP profile once for the full 3200 speed, as every setup goes. XMP default settings are excellent and by simply choosing 3467 memory instead of 3200 it runs fast and stable at the XMP default settings for 3200 without changing any voltage or timing, so nice little bump for free although of course YMMV, but reading technical reviews on this shows very similar results, just as good as the more expensive brands for less. So bottom-line highly recommended for not only AMD systems but for Intel as well, heck, they come in Intel blue anyway right? ;)",15,True
4,Good replacement for Intellimouse Explorer 3.0,"As others have said, the form factor between the EC1 and the Intellimouse Explorer 3.0 are very similar. I would agree, they are nearly identical.<br /><br />One shortcoming that will keep it from getting a 5-star review: you cannot customize the buttons. With the Intellimouse Explorer 3.0 and practically every other mouse out there, you can install software that will allow you to customize the functions of the buttons. This one does not come with such software, so the middle mouse click will be for auto-scrolling, the 2 side buttons will be for Forward and Backward in your web browser. You can still customize the buttons in-game, but that's assuming the game you're playing allows it and is able to identify the buttons. Some don't and that's where button customization helps. You can also download 3rd party software to address this, but there's nothing like software that was designed specifically for the mouse.<br /><br />Another issue is the finish of the mouse. The material on either side of the mouse is too smooth, making lifting the mouse difficult, at times. If you have dry hands, you'll definitely notice the issue. Too slippery. If you're having the same issue, look up 'talon grips'. There are guides online that show you how to attach these to your mouse. It's pretty-straightforward, though.",6,True
4,Lots of customization and a good replacement for Intellimouse Explorer 3.0,"I've been using the MS Intellimouse Explorer for roughly the past 15 years. Went through 3 of them in total and when this latest one died on me, I found out MS no longer manufactures them. All the ones you find online are dubious in authenticity.<br /><br />This Logitech mouse is good. The form factor is similar to the Intellimouse, but not quite. The Intellimouse is a bit larger, allowing you to rest most of your palm onto it. You can't really do that with this mouse. It's just not as big. Furthermore, the Intellimouse has a large empty area the left side, allowing you to comfortably grip it with your thumb. This mouse does not have the same amount of space. You can't get a good grip on the mouse with your thumb because of the way the left side is angled and also because you risk pushing up against the two buttons closest to your thumb. That also means if you're the type of user who frequently lifts your mouse, as opposed to moving the mouse across a large area of your mouse pad, you're gonna have a bad time. After a full day of usage, my palm ached. This mouse isn't designed for frequent lifting, so be aware of your usage style.<br /><br />The scroll wheel on this is also not very good. When you put it into smooth scrolling, the slightest touch will make the wheel scroll, so I ran into this every now and then with my index finger rubbing up against it. Also, the wheel has very little friction when put into smooth scrolling mode: this thing will spin forever. That sounds great, but in practice, it's stupid because nobody needs that. The wheel needs more friction so that users don't have to keep their finger on it to keep it from running away as they are scrolling through a page.<br /><br />When you put the scroll wheel into step mode, you run into the issue of it requiring too much force to turn the wheel. Combine that with the fact that the wheel itself is a smooth plastic makes for a very non-user-friendly experience. To reliably get this to spin, you have to apply a lot of force to the wheel to create the friction needed to turn it. That also means you'll occasionally click the wheel when you only wanted to scroll. It wouldn't have killed to make the wheel out of rubber. Smooth plastic was a bad idea.<br /><br />The Logitech software for customizing the mouse is great. Lots of options, no complaints there. The mouse itself is high quality. The USB cable has a nice nylon or some similar material wrapped around it, protecting the wire.<br /><br />In the end, I had to return the mouse after 2 days of use. The form factor didn't suit my usage style and the scroll wheel was driving me nuts. I still think the mouse itself is great and am disappointed things didn't work out.",1,True

The backplate did have very thick insulating bumpers, but I wouldn't trust them.<br />I installed this HSF on an i7-6800K, and I can run all cores at 3800MHz easily, and temp.s don't go above 63ºC.",0,True

3,Would be a really great mouse if you could disable the intelligent sleep function,"I will start by saying that I would have given this mouse at least 4 stars if it didn't have the annoying sleep function.  I have previously had Anker vertical mice and really loved them.  I decided to try the LevKey version since it has the same footprint but is rechargeable.  The texture is much smoother and more slippery than the Anker, which took some getting used to.  It moves very smoothly and is quiet (no click sounds).  I do a lot of work on my computer, from graphic design to spreadsheets and a few games.  This mouse goes to sleep much too quickly, in less than 20 seconds.  You need to click a button to wake it up.  Of course the computer recognizes this as a click, so now I've opened or moved or otherwise done something I didn't want to do in order to wake up the mouse.  And there is a 5-10 second lag between when you click and when it responds, so you're not even sure if it's sleeping or has a more serious issue.  I've tried moving the mouse around the screen to wake it up but the response time is even slower.  When my Anker mice went to sleep, you just barely moved them and they were awake and responsive.  The more I use this mouse, the more I think the sleep function is going to be a deal breaker for me.",0,True

4,Does the job of rack mounting your Intel NUC's,"The rack mount chassis allows you to get your Intel NUC's off of a shelf and rack mount them.<br /><br />Since the NUC is held in place with a single screw at the center, the NUC can pivot side to side when you're connecting the network cable, power or other device. I would have preferred if this chassis was constructed so that it was a little deeper and had a piece metal that ran along either side of each NUC. That would hold the NUC in place more securely.<br /><br />You'll also notice that the NUC can bow up and down if touched even slightly if nothing is mounted immediately below this chassis. For this reason, I moved another server and mounted it right below this chassis.<br /><br />If you want to mount the NUC's with the back of the NUC to the front, as I have, you'll have to route power and the network cable to the front of the rack. One way to do this is with a 1U cable management insert. Given the small number of cables, I didn't want to take up 1U for that purpose. So I ran the power and network cables through the keystone jack insert, as you'll note in the picture. But I may give in and add the 1U cable management insert and route power and network through that opening.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with this rack mount chassis.

It is a wonder how I never came across and never installed a just-above-entry level CPU cooler. I either installed stock CPU fans, or high grade 50$-150$ water and air coolers. This time, I just wanted to go for a little bit better one than stock just for the fun of it. I wish I hadn't. The stock Intel CPU coolers are more compact, feel better quality (really), more durable, and at least cheaper.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Large heat spreader<br />- Not too big and doesn't take up much space<br />- Both AMD and Intel compatible<br />- Comes with low grade thermal paste  in case you don't wanna waste your Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut on a low end CPU that will never get overclocked or expected to work under any serious load<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The fan! It is Cooler Master's cheapest case fan attached to the heat spreader!<br />- The legs are not attached to the intel adapter. Makes it much harder to work with it while installing. What makes it worse is, they are not durable and when clipping them, one of them broke (I did it tens of times with other CPU coolers, and never had this problem)<br />- Noise! You can hear the fan even when the CPU is working under 50% load.",0,True

They said something about it likely being a “passive” adaptor rather than “active” adaptor. Also i have an old Intel HD Graphics 2500, which might not have the bandwith to support 3 monitors. IT department is trying to see if there is anything we can do, but I’ve been working with them for 30 mins now. Likely I’ll return it.

It comes down to the limitation of the CPU. I have a Dell Latitude E6510 and it has an i5 520M CPU which has a limitation of high density ram. You have to buy specific ram that works for the older gen i3, i5, and i7.

5,Great with Intel Rapid Start Technology or just with its own software,"Need a small SSD drive to take advantage of your motherboard's built-in Intel Rapid Start Technology?  This is the drive for you.  You won't find another small SSD drive from a reputable company at around the 50 dollar mark.  For others just looking to speed up their computer a bit without taking the full plunge switching over to a full SSD then this works for you as well.  Plug and play, after installing the software of course.  ;)  If you are tech savvy enough, I recommend installing it without the software and using the IRST capability of your mainboard, if available.  Otherwise, the software works just fine and doesn't seem to strain the machine at all.  I will admit that I haven't tested the drive on a lower powered machine though, so your milage may vary...<br /><br />With the cache drive, windows boot up is quick and app/program launch times are nearly instantaneous.  However, don't expect any difference when transferring/copying files.  That will still be the responsibility of your mechanical drive.  There ARE much faster SSD drives out on the market.  But I give this item 5 stars for what it is meant to do at its given price point.  Again, 50 bucks will allow you to dip your feet into the waters of SSD drives.  Is it worth it to you?  Only you can answer that...  ;)<br /><br />One note of caution:  While installing this drive into a family member's machine, I ran into a problem that seems to be plaguing many others.  That being that the drive would flush itself after rebooting from a full shutdown.  It seems the solution, at least under Windows 8, is to disable the Fast Startup feature under Power Options>System Settings.  Click on ""Choose what the power buttons do"" in Power Options which is found in Control Panel or just search for ""power options"".  You will find the check box there and you might also have to click on ""Change settings that are currently unavailable"" if you find that it is grayed out.  This seems to be a known issue with Windows 8's hybrid Sleep/Hibernate startup feature.  Disable that and you should be fine.  Windows will still swiftly resume from Sleep and boot up fairly quickly so you might not even notice that much of a difference between checked and unchecked since if it isn't working with the ReadyCache drive it probably isn't working as it should without it.<br /><br />Also, although this drive is marketed as a cache drive it can still be used like any normal SSD drive.  It's size is just something to keep in mind if you are trying to build a small inexpensive system.",1,False

2,Not the best choice for Intel builds,"This cooler is a bit more expensive than others but it's clearly also a quality device. There is one problem however - the Intel mounting bracket (for the back side of the motherboard) is a flimsy piece of junk! The AMD brackets are solid metal and will surely work nicely.<br /><br />The Intel bracket is soft plastic. It has captive nuts that receive the standoffs from the front side of the MB. These nuts slide in channels to fit various MBs. The only thing holding the nut into the channel is a tiny ridge molded to the  inside the slot. If you put any torque on the standoff without keeping the bracket absolutely flush, the nut pops through the bracket and now your bracket is only attached at three corners. And once that nut has popped through once, it won't stay put any longer. I eventually used superglue to lock the nut to the bracket.<br /><br />This part should be metal, or at least plastic with metal nuts and washers to attach it. You'll need to be very careful using this for an Intel build. Or you can use the equivalent MSI cooler instead, which is louder but has a rock-solid mounting system.",0,True

3,"Pretty good, but issues with Intel HD graphics","The bios is great. Intend to try the overclock software but it seems easy to use. The connections are ok, although the 24-pin PSU was really difficult to get to fit. Was really worried about damaging the unit but it seems ok.<br /><br />I'll devote most of my review discussing my issues with it since that's what motivated me to review:<br /><br />The community has identified problems with intel HD graphics where the motherboard stops outputting video after the driver is installed. THe screen goes black after loading windows screen immediately after restart from installing driver. Must boot in safe mode to uninstall the driver. Intel has posted (search official intel hd graphics black screen) that they are aware of the problem but can't identify the cause of the issue, and are having issues recreating it as it sporadically happens on some motherboards but not others and not consistently. They were able to obtain one system that had the issue and determined it was a hardware issue however and so I blame MSI, although in practice its probably some chip/part supplier out there selling defective crap to MSI and other board makers since it's not happening consistently across the same suppliers. My motherboard has this issue as well and I am unable to run Intel HD graphics. I'm stuck with generic drivers until I install a graphics card. I am considering returning it but the board is already installed and it would be a bit of a pain and I'm installing a graphics card this weekend..<br /><br />Another issue i have is also not unique to this motherboard, but you will almost certainly run in to this issue if you fit certain criteria. Some older SSDs (Kingston SSDNows in particular) were not fully SATA compliant (there is a Toms hardware post somewhere about it, took me forever to diagnose) and while they work on older motherboards, there's something about the newer motherboards that stops them from recognizing the drive and having all sorts of issues. I moved an SSD from my laptop to this computer and the ssd still works fine on my laptop, but it wont recognize on this motherboard. I read on that TH post that this issue only affects SSDs from 2010 and earlier, but my kingston SSD now is from last year and I had this issue.<br /><br />EDIT<br /><br />I forgot to say anything about the wifi card. I had a lot of problems at first with the wifi card, similar to the problems the other reviewer noted, but these have been resolved after fully running windows update. No problems with it now and get good speed out of it. although I'm relatively unimpressed with the choice as it lacks 5ghz and I'm pretty sure its the same wifi card I have in my Laptop...<br /><br />EDIT 2<br /><br />After painstakingly troubleshooting this problem for hours, I have resolved the HD graphics issue, but I will note that it wasn't easy and I'm maintaining my rating on the product, as the software for updating the system drivers was anything but intuitive. The issue seems to have been linked to not fully updated drivers from other components of the motherboard, but I'm still not sure. in fact i'm worried that once I restart it will stop working... Completely unclear what I did to fix it, but this product should be functional out of the box. I tried to use the live update 5 program that comes with the board to update all the drivers to the newest version. It wouldnt work nad I had to manually install the drivers that it downloaded. Then it wasnt even able to download the drivers and I had to find them on the internet. Very disappointed.<br /><br />EDIT 3<br /><br />Five months in one of the SATA ports unexplainably stopped working.. Very very annoying",2,False

4,ASUS VivoPC VM60-G106M Intel Core i5 Bare Bones,"ASUS VivoPC VM60-G106M Intel Core i5 bare bones was my first experience in setting up a non-tower based system. There are some major differences and limitations. The reason I wanted to go with this system in the first place is I am setting up a smaller cabin cruiser boat as a fully functioning liveaboard with flat panel TV and standalone monitor on a swingarm. SPACE is a MAJOR limitation, and I figured I could attach this to a wall out of the way, saving both floor and counter space, which are both at a premium. My internet is a paid Wi-Fi connection that is available in the marina here, but is VERY SLOW.<br /><br />Because of both motion and mounting vertically I felt I needed to use an SSD, and my research led me to the Samsung EVO 840 250GB drive, reserving 10% for drive longevity (per manufacturers specs). 8GB (4x2) RAM PNY. I didn't know it would need laptop RAM, but it did. I was advised to use two sticks, which went against the grain for me - max out ONE slot and then you can add another, but 8GB should be fine since I'm not planning on doing any video editing. HDMI port for the 32&#34; Samsung LED Smart TV, and video out to my old 15&#34; monitor on the arm.<br /><br />The HARDWARE part was very straightforward and simple. The 2.5&#34; SSD mounted onto the adaptor plate that was included with the screws included as well. My plan was to load the OS from a thumbdrive ISO of Win8.0. That was the plan, anyway. I was able to get it to partially boot up, but it was so unstable that it was useless - crashing into BSOD (blue screen of death). Since I'm older now and not as compelled by my ego to do everything myself, I took a trip to my local computer store. They verified my ISO and even gave me one of theirs that they had used before setting up MANY machines - no good. Called and spoke to Microsoft Tech Support, who eventually bumped me up to a level 2 tech support guru. They thought if we could manage to keep it together long enough to upgrade it to 8.1, that it would stabilize. After MANY hours online, they eventually gave up and offered to send me the Win8.1 disk FREE.<br /><br />Now as we all know, this system doesn't have a CD Rom drive, so now I'm forced to buy more hardware. I went with the Samsung USB 2.0 Ultra Portable External DVD Writer Model SE-218CB/RSBS which worked well and had a relatively small footprint, but only runs via USB 2.0, so it became the slowest link in the chain. Fresh install using the disk STILL left me with an unstable system. Call back to Microsoft Tech Support - level 2 techs. Many more hours online with them trying to troubleshoot the 'problem'. They ended up wanting to blame the hardware for the instability issues, but everything that was testable checked out.<br /><br />Now I'm an old IT guy, and not one to throw in the towel because some kid in the Philippians says to send the system back and buy something else. He said that my only other solution was to install Win7, but that they wouldn't provide me an install disk for it - I was on my own. Did he REALLY think I was going to settle for that after having paid for a full install version of Win8? I told him he could either help me or transfer me to his supervisor. Funny how they don't like to do that! :) He did have a thought that I hadn't attempted - try doing a fresh install but only load the absolute BASIC number of drivers required to reconnect to the internet so they could remote connect. I took it one step further by ONLY installing the Windows Updates that were HANGING and required to install the other upgrades. Also, I installed those updates MANUALLY, directly from the Microsoft website. IT WORKED!<br /><br />So after all that handholding and manually walking things through, I now have a system that seems to be relatively stable. My research has lead me to believe that had I been able to connect directly using a hardwired connection to the internet, that I might not have had these problems. All I can say is, there were a LOT of people posting that were having the same problem, and were unable to get it resolved by Microsoft, and were told &#34;We're waiting on our engineers to release a fix&#34;. Really, for OVER 6 MONTHS?<br /><br />If you want this setup to go easier, you MAY want to just copy or use an already setup hard drive with windows on it and just make the driver changes. If I wasn't set on using the SSD I would have just paid the money for a complete system, since it won't save you any money if you have to buy the other components.

1,Known problem with intel I225-V ethernet chip !  AND Terrible ASUS support,"Updated review::<br /><br />I discovered unfortunately that this motherboard, and many like it with the intel I225-V ethernet chipset have a nasty habit of failing to work properly.  I suppose you'll have to play the lottery with this board.. but what happened to me is that my board worked fine for 3-4 weeks and then one day the ethernet port just stopped working properly at all.. I checked everything, my router, my cables, my power, my internet.. but all the evidence, including the onboard diagnostics, point to a bad ethernet chipset.  This is a known problem too !  Lots of other people with other brands and boards with the I225-V chipset are having these issues... Stay away from boards with the I225-V ethernet controller if you value your time and sanity.. the frusteration is not worth it.<br /><br />On top of all this, ASUS's support has been.. well, pretty terrible.  A revolving door of different people suggesting everything from buying my own ethernet card (they wouldn't give me one of their own branded ones) to suggesting I go weeks without a motherboard while they RMA'd it.  No thanks... if that's how they support their customers i'll take my purchases of motherboards elsewhere.  ASUS: if you're listening, I literally buy hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in computer equipment.. and this crappy experience is putting you on my personal supplier blacklist.<br /><br />Old review:::  If you look at all the available AMD boards, this one has a great featureset, but is also very expensive for a B550 board.

Before I got this I looked at the pictures and saw the echo dot perched on top of this s speaker and was concerned it might fall off.

There is a plastic cover on the back, covering the plugs where you plug in the power for the dot and a plug that connects the audio to the speaker.  Then you put the cover back on.  At the bottom of the speaker you plug in the power.  I shut off the small speaker I was using and the sound automatically started playing through the new speaker.<br /><br />The sound is impressive.  It's far better than what I had.  I also like that you only have to plug in one cord.  Bottom line it's a great way to update your dot.

5,"Finally, a mini PC with the latest gen Intel CPU","[[VIDEOID:88d15f8227ef3bdf6993703f19569554]] I was looking for a mini PC with the latest gen cpu for a special cyber security project when I saw this product.  The small footprint of this mini PC is great for small projects and portability.  I bought it and currently enjoying it.<br /><br />The product packaging is way better than the older mini PCs I bought before, it has a modern look and better branding on it.  Inside the box are the mini PC, a 2.5 inch drive expansion kit, a long and a short HDMI cable, a VESA mounting bracket, and user guide.  The setup was very quick, it was up and running in just a few minutes, including Windows updates.  In comparison with the Celeron cpus, this mini PC feels like 10x faster based on actual user experience.  I was able to run multiple office productivity apps all at the same time without a problem (using 16GB of memory).  I connected this mini PC to my LG 4K monitor, and it plays 4K videos very smoothly, I have another QHD ultrawide monitor and dual display works fine with QHD+UHD monitors.  This mini PC runs cool and quiet even at heavy loads, I tried playing some casual games like Asphalt 9 and CSGO, and they are surprisingly playable.  Upgrade options are easy for this mini PC, just remove the 4 screws at the bottom and you’ll have access to the M.2 drive, memory, and 2.5 inch drive installation.  It’s nice that they included 2 ribbon cables in the HDD expansion kit for the 2.5 inch drive just in case you break one.  Since this is for a special project, I installed Linux (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS) and all the hardware were detected fine, but mileage may vary depending on the distro used.  It feels snappier running Linux than Windows in my opinion.  If there is only one thing, I wish they added another M.2 slot inside as there are enough space for one more slot, but that’s just me for my project, most people won’t need an extra M.2 slot.  So, performance wise, this mini PC ticks the boxes on all my requirements.  One thing I love the most is the small footprint this mini PC has, it is very convenient to move around and stow away if not in use.  The VESA mounting bracket is very useful if ever I will repurpose this as an HTPC and hide it behind my TV.<br /><br />Overall, this mini PC impressed me.  The build quality and performance is perfect for my specific needs.  The size and portability is another selling point, and I wouldn’t hesitate to buy another one if needed.",11,True

2,On board Intel graphics failures,"This is a good computer for the price if the quality control and Acer support was better. I ordered one back in January and it failed within a week - screen was black except when you went into the boot menu. I hadn't installed much so I went along with Acer's solution to everything - reinstall Windows 10.  That didn't solve anything and I sent it back to Amazon for a replacement. This worked fine for over a month until the same problem showed up again. Again Acer's only suggestion was to reinstall windows or send everything back to their service center in Texas so they could reinstall windows. I went through all the suggestions on line about the black screen problem. Probably ended up rebooting about 200 times. If I deleted the video drivers for the Intel 530 onboard graphics, I could sometimes get Windows to come up before the screen went black. Finally went out and bought a cheap video card. This disables the on board graphics and solved the problem.<br />Based on my experience with two computers (manufacture date 9/25/2016) I believe the motherboards were defective or marginal. The Acer support people have a set script for solving problems which basically consists of reinstalling Windows. While this brute force approach might work with driver problems, it does nothing to solve hardware problems. If you decide to send the computer back for repair, they are very clear that you will lose everything on the hard drive.<br /><br />I understand that these are low end computers, but they should be much more reliable on this and there should be better support when there is a hardware problem. A simple 5 minute swap of the motherboard would have solved this without forcing me to go out and get a graphic card. My wife was looking for another computer as well, but it will not be an Acer.",4,True

Intel cards are trash, if I had known this laptop had it, I wouldn't even bought it..<br /><br />But other than that, the laptop is pretty nice once you tweak the settings to your liking. Nice keyboard, good cd/DVD drive and USB on both sides of the laptop. Hdmi input as well.",2,True
2,Less that inthused with Intel,"UPDATE:<br />After 5 years, this computer is no longer usable. It randomly turns off (Black screen of death.) I tried everything; uninstalling software, BIOS updates, older drivers, increased cooling, and finally even a clean install with wiping the hard drive. Still, without warning, the computer turns off, corrupting files and losing data. Since then, I have found that this is a common issue with Intel motherboard's built-in graphics cards, and that the company hasn't addressed it. Perhaps it has been fixed in generation 12 and later, but it appears to still be an issue up to generation 11.<br /><br />IN SUMMARY, THESE MACHINES HAVE A MAX FIVE (5) YEAR LIFE.<br /><br />_______<br />I am less enthused with the Intel NUC.  This replaces an older version that had issues.  I have to say that I'm not nearly as happy with this unit as I'd hoped to be especially considering<br /><br />Pros<br />1. Very fast when combined with top of the line components.  I have a M.2 type M SSD (fastest commercial drive class) with 32gb high speed ram and a second standard high speed 2&#34; SSD.  The system hibernates in less than 10 seconds compared to as long as 2 minutes on the older version.<br />2. It really is small.  I could put it in a coat pocket if necessary.<br />3. Has most basic ports like USB 3, C and charging.  It also has a MicroSD slot and Video.<br />4. The power supply cord isn't too short like some previous models.<br />5. Intel has a web page dedicated to updates (hint, you'll need it!)<br />6. Components snap in very easily; it took just a few minutes to add the drives and memory and then boot up for the first time.<br /><br />Cons<br />1. Buggy!  I've had to update firmware repeatedly as well as downgrade due to major bugs on new drivers and even the BIOS. I've spent several hours going back and forth trying to figure out which driver or firmware is causing hanging, loop booting, video/audio issues or software problems.  I've given up on some of the minor video anomalies as I just can't get it to work. Update have come regularly from Intel, but haven't always worked. VERY Frustrating!<br />2. It's louder that the previous larger model.  The fan goes turbo when I'm doing photo editing.<br />3. The microSD card is a lot less useful that a full SD card slot.  I'd gladly have traded a 1/4 inch taller unit for something that could use the preferred card size.<br />4. Incompatibility issues.  For some reason, this set up will not run some older software even though other Windows10 machines I have do.<br />5. Quality control is questionable.  This is actually the second unit.  I had to return the first one as one of the USB ports broke off on it's second use.",5,True

There was tv flicker of picture only when using PS3, but it is resolved thus far on my tv. Just power off all, follow CNET tv/ps3 settings, use good hdmi cable (read CNET cable reviews - cheap cable ok), plug into hdmi port, then restart tv first, select ps3 hdmi input, then power ps3 - this is the startup order for initial startup only... All other times start as you wish... Flicker gone. All other technology runs very smooth also. Picture is very impressive! 2D blu ray is amazing!!! My 3D glasses on way, testing 3d next week. Will try to update. This tv is an AWESOME DEAL! This is $2000 dollars of technology!  Not sure if blockbuster working fully at moment cuz their agreement with Vizio? Or cuz I am not a member? Did not see Vizio TV on Blockbuster TV list -not sure here yet-, Netflix works great, looks like 720p from Netflix, sometimes looks 1080p.  Was able to look to hulu and Vudu previews, YouTube.  PS3 works and looks amazing! (My lag from LCD 37"" 60hz is gone) - whats left is connection lag now - read ps3 forums for data there - i love ps3 on this tv - Will play COD black ops 3D next week. Flicker bothered me a little at first, BUT IT IS GONE NOW FOR 3 days straight, just follow instructions, you will be fine.  If you are lucky you will buy this AWESOME AMERICAN PRODUCT too!!!

5,Very good cooler. A HUGE improvement on Intel's stock.,"I have a Core i7 4770k running at stock speeds that was overheating with simple Adobe Premiere Pro renders, let alone Prime95 testing. So I replaced the cooler with this one. It's installed using Arctic MX-4 thermal paste. It was very easy to attach to the motherboard as long as you remove the fan first. However, clipping the fan on took a few tries. Nothing too hard though.<br /><br />I ran it right out of the box and the temps at full throttle cpu usage dropped from 80+C to 60C. I run my case fans a bit slower than many to control overall noise so these temps might be a tad higher than others, but they are perfect for me.<br /><br />GEEK NOTE: Because I had a better fan lying around (brand new Noctua NF-F12), I traded the stock fan after about a week. It was a bit quieter and I expect it to last longer. It definitely cools better, but the stock fan wasn't bad. Especially with the case closed and quiet.",0,True
2,Grossly Overpriced Compared to the Competition (Intel NUC),"Despite my star rating, this isn't a bad machine.  Machines of this form factor aren't something I'd recommend for general use - though they seem cheap, once you've spent money for the necessary RAM, SSD hard drive, and OS if you're using Windows (and a wireless card, monitor, keyboard, and mouse if you need them), you're looking at a much more expensive machine than a similarly specced desktop, and a comparable price to a similarly specced laptop.  The processor is a low-voltage laptop processor, so its much less powerful than a desktop and not up to par for any gaming above the most casual level.  Needless to say its also not up to par for CPU-intensive tasks such as advanced multimedia work.<br /><br />What machines of this form factor are great for is uses that require an always-on low voltage solution (to keep the power bill low), such as a home media server.  I'm using my VivoMini as a Plex server, for instance.  They also work great as a media PC hooked up to a TV, and I've read stories of people using them in many creative ways (such as a teacher who brings it from class to class and hooks it up to a projector).<br /><br />I hooked up my machine with 4 gb of RAM I had lying around, and paid $80 for a 250 gb samsung msata drive.  The machine works great, and can transcode a 1080p video for streaming.<br /><br />That said ... this model is grossly overpriced.  It has a 4th gen core i5 processor, and as of this writing is $390. For $380 you can get an Intel Nuc with a 6th generation core i5 processor, which offers significant performance gains across every category while retaining the same low power usage.  With a small barebones model such as this you're essentially just paying for the CPU.  The motherboard, housing, and power supply are almost incidental costs when compared to the cost of the CPU in the machine.  Given that, the VivoMini is a horrendous deal at the current price.  I'll comment with a link to a comparison of the processors (I'm not sure if amazon still cuts links out of reviews).<br /><br />The Intel Nuc also uses much newer components, including DDR4 memory.  For $10 you can get a VESA compatible mount for the Nuc as well (the VivoMini comes packaged with one, which is an absolutely necessary add-on at the ridiculous price-point the machine is set at).<br /><br />To add insult to injury the drivers that this machine comes with are outdated - some aren't even compatible with the latest updates to Windows (I put Windows 7 on the machine - the drivers would be even more outdated when used with Windows 10).  I had to fiddle around a bit to get everything working correctly.  The drivers also come on a CD - meaning you'll need a USB CD drive if you even want to use them.  For the price point they should have been packaged on a USB stick, at the very least.<br /><br />There are a lot of 5 star Vine reviews, which is unfortunate - as I don't believe the reviewers did research on comparable machines and didn't realize what an atrocious value this product is.<br /><br />If the price were to drop to the low $200s ($200-$230 or so) I'd consider it reasonably priced, as that puts it in line with the 4th generation Nuc pricing as of this writing.  But its almost double that.",6,False

4,"It's good, but I went with Intel's 900p SSD instead.","It's great, but I returned it when I saw Intel's 900p 480GB SSD for about the same price as this. Yes it is half the storage as the Samsung, but Intel's 4K speeds are way way faster. Really overall it is faster on sequential speeds too. It is great for boot times, loading games, etc. The one I bought is a PCIe SSD so it will only work in Desktops. If you only have a laptop then this Samsung SSD would be better still.<br /><br />And to those of you thinking I'm crazy saying Intel's 900p is faster even on sequential speeds here is why I say that. The Intel PCIe SSD is basically just a SSD with a big heatsink on it to help dissipate the heat. Samsung's drives are technically faster for sequential reads and writes, but they thermal throttle very quickly. Even though I put the Samsung drive in my desktop motherboard's heatsink m.2 slot it still slowed down below the Intel 900p's speeds because it got too warm too fast. The Intel 900p in my experience is faster in every way because it consistently keeps lower temps to ensure it performs at its max through prolonged use in heavy workloads. None of my Samsung SSDs can do that.",0,True

After I told them never mind, I'll just return it to amazon, they agreed to send the kit to me for free. So, I did get it working in the end and it works well. I feel like it is misleading that they ask you to pay for something which should have been included, and it was a bummer to have my brand new PC in parts for an extra week while I was waiting for the kit to arrive. That said, It does appear that they have since updated their wording to let you know that the AM4 kit is not included. I do think it works well and is priced well so I ordered a second one for a new build.

When I installed the i7 in the new motherboard, the Intel cooler would not go on correctly.  After I finally got it in place, CPU temps were topping 70C degrees during normal use.  I got a few warnings that the CPU temp was hitting 102C! I guess due to not adding more thermal paste.<br /><br />I knew it was time to replace the cooler IMMEDIATELY.  Being a minimalist, and not an overclocker I did not want a huge cooler in my case as everything is very clean and roomy inside.<br /><br />Anyway, I cleaned the processor top with a little alcohol and a clean cloth, got off the remaining thermal paste, and installed this cooler.  It snapped right in place and fits very snugly against the processor.<br /><br />My normal running temps are now between 39C and 42C.

The main reason I upgraded was to get native SATA 6 and USB 3.0 motherboard support. I did not use the supplied CPU cooler. I am using water cooling. The CPU temperature is 36 degrees C normally and 50 degrees C when using Prime 95 to test long term stability.<br /><br />My [[ASIN:B009NHAF5G 250GB - Samsung 840 Series Solid State Drive (SSD) with Desktop and Notebook Installation Kit 250 sata_6_0_gb 2.5-Inch MZ-7TD250KW]] Samsung SSD increased the Windows performance disk index from 7.2 to 7.9 and that is definitely much better. The RAM memory performance index decreased slightly for some strange reason. The best RAM score I've achieved is 7.5 versus 7.6 for my Corsair 1600 MHz Ram with 9-9-9-24 timing. I don't understand that, but it is consistent. I kept my XFX [[ASIN:B0037YOIMC XFX ATI Radeon HD 5850 1 GB DDR5 2DVI/HDMI/DisplayPort PCI-Express Video Card HD585XZAFC]]. My graphics and gaming graphics numbers are still the same at 7.7. But the Windows index for the CPU speed is only 7.4. That's somewhat surprising to me because my old Intel i7 920 came in at 7.1.  The fastest stable overclock I've achieved is 4.572 GHz and yet the Windows performance index stubbornly remains at 7.4. I don't know what it takes to bump the Windows CPU index number any higher.<br /><br />Whatever the case, the next time I upgrade in a few years, I may want to reconsider Intel's i7 product line. I am not saying that the AMD processor won't be a consideration. It really is very fast - and far more economical. This is my fourth computer build in the past five years (three AMD and one Intel). I researched the AMD vs. Intel performance ranking more thoroughly after I bought this system and this CPU barely ranks over the Intel i7 920 CPU, which surprised me. I know that the Intel processors are overpriced, but now after sinking a lot of money into the fastest AMD processor and Asus motherboard, I am becoming to believe that CPU speed isn't the sole factor in performance. I am not going to upgrade again for a few more years, but I will really consider the i7 series with hyper-threading-technology in the future even though it is more than double the cost of AMD.

I have computers from all the top well-known brands.  My HP products have lasted the longest.  I like the HP keyboards and their touchpads.  They seem to have the best &#34;touch&#34; and the right strength for my big hands.  If you want a cool, sexy. thin ultrabook, this is not that type of product.  This is a good, solid, notebook computer to last in a backpack (slightly heavier than a ultrabook), or use at home as your main computer.  It is fast enough with the iCore 5 Intel processor, but an SSD from Intel is a great upgrade.  Mine came with an Intel 520 Series 180GB and it works fantastic.",23,True
4,I have never seen a pair of headphones with a more intelligently designed means of preventing the tangling of left-and-right bud,"Probably the most intelligently-designed headphones I have ever owned. I have never seen a pair of headphones with a more intelligently designed means of preventing the tangling of left-and-right buds, since they clip together, nor the integrated cable tie built into the plug to keep them managed. The plug did not quite seat in the headphone jack of my phone, but a little trimming with an exacto knife solved the connection issues.

5,Intelligent design and well executed,"This is a really smartly designed briefcase that can be converted to a backpack. The straps that make it a backpack clip on at the bottom to a piece sewn onto the corners of the bag, and when not in use, you just unclip them and tuck them into a pocket that then zips up. It's hard to even tell they are in there and the pieces sewn onto the outside don't garner much attention when not in use.<br /><br />This has a dual handle with the velcro piece that goes around it to secure the handles together, and also has a strap that can be adjusted to fit how you want, letting you carry this over your shoulder or across your chest, in addition to simply holding it by the handles like a typical briefcase. Pretty much any way you'd want to hold/carry this bag, you can.<br /><br />There's two pockets on the outside, the larger of which has a few sewn in holders on the inside, and zips securely to hold whatever you put in there. The smaller pocket is ideal for carrying your laptop charger, and unzips across the top and down one entire side to give you easier access to what's in there. This pocket also has a zipper on the outside for small items that you don't want to get lost with everything else.<br /><br />The main area unzips halfway down one side, and completely down the other, which saves you the hassle of trying to finagle your laptop in without having more opening space. There is a large pocket open on the top sewn into the inside, which is padded and has a strap that secures by velcro over the top of it. I put my laptop in this pocket, so I don't have to worry about it shifting around much in the rest of the main area. There is then a smaller pocket sewn on the front of this storage pocket, which is great for a spiral notebook or something similar. The rest of that main pocket can hold binders, or whatever else you need.<br /><br />In terms of overall size, think of this as a briefcase rather than a backpack. You won't get several textbooks in this bag like you would a typical backpack, but it still holds what you need for business type stuff, or just a class or two.<br /><br />The overall look has a professional feel to it. I love the color - it's a dark gray, rather than being black. This is fabric, so it has a slightly more casual look to it than typical briefcases, but it's so well manufactured and smartly designed that it makes up for that in the professional area. There is also black vinyl along the bottom, to give some extra protection on what is otherwise an all cloth product. And to make this even better, it comes with a 5 year warranty on it.",2,False

5,Well engineered hub/power supply/Intel certified TB4 cable...,"Purchase based on numerous reviews from tech blogs and other publications. There are less expensive alternatives but CalDigit seems to be a company that can be trusted to provide well engineered products that perform safely and reliably to spec. This isn't the case with all manufacturers. With potentially thousands of dollars of equipment connected, it's best to steer away from 'low bidder' manufacturers.<br /><br />With the purchase of this hub, you also get a good quality switching power supply and an Intel certified Thunderbolt 4 cable. This is likely where much of the cost is. Currently, Intel certified TB4 cables of this length (0.8m, ~2.6ft) are ~40 dollars or more and comparable power supplies ~80 dollars or more. When buying mission critical power supplies and interconnects, always buy certified (UL, CE, Intel, etc) At the least, buy from a well established and trustworthy manufacturer.<br /><br />While it's capable of charging power hungry laptops, it would be advisable to buy something more evenly matched with the equipment you're using. For example, MacBook Pro's and Windows gaming/workstation laptops  may need a power supply with higher output. This power supply is rated at 150 watts total but the laptop port is limited to 60 watts. The upside is that this is a consistent 60 watts regardless of what the other peripherals are pulling. This hub is perfect for the MacBook Air and Windows/ChromeBook laptops with modest power requirements.<br /><br />I also use a Satechi Aluminum Multi-Port Adapter V2 for travel. It's performed well and is ~1/3 the cost but it's a passive device. Power delivery is pass through provided in my case with the Apple power supply provided with the purchase of the M1 Air. The Satechi and similar products from Anker and others may be the only hub a lot of people will need. That said, when the cost of the CalDigit's power supply and Intel certified cable are deducted, the cost difference between the two is somewhat leveled.<br /><br />The CalDigit Element hub leans more towards being workstation hub. This is due to it needing the included power supply which is larger than the hub it powers. Regardless, it's far from large in absolute terms (6"" x 3"" x1"") and could easily be used for travel sacrificing only some convenience.<br /><br />A nice touch and indicative of a manufacturer that sweats the details is that the hub is reversible. Silicone 'rails' are provided with the purchase. These slide into the grooves which are on the top and bottom of the hub. The power port is located on the side, not the back so if space is tight as it was in my case, this frees up about 4.5 inches. This was just just enough to reach my Mac without having to compromise on placement of the hub or having to move the shelving where the Mac is staged.<br /><br />An alternative is to buy a longer cable but Intel certified TB4 cables from trustworthy companies are expensive currently. As of this writing, 6ft models (apparently the next size up from 0.8m/~2.6ft) seem to start at about 60 dollars. TB4 cables are highly engineered and complex products carrying multiple wires in precise configurations and have tiny circuit boards molded into the connectors. It's unlikely that the cost of these will drop significantly anytime soon. At least not from reliable companies.<br /><br />For those that need a well engineered hub that will safely and reliably provide power, TB4 and USB A connectivity, you can't go wrong with this one. Very nice product, happy customer.",4,True

2,Bare minimum call blocking with no useful presets or intelligence,"FEATURES<br /><br />On the description it says it &#34;recognizes spammers (black list)&#34; which I thought meant it actually did some logic and came preloaded with some intelligence. It does no such thing - it doesn't run phone numbers though an algorithm to likely determine a spammer, so it is relying on YOU to recognize spammers and manually add them to a blacklist.  Of course, spammers are clever and go through numbers like you and I go through toilet paper. There's no way to download a list or update the firmware. This is an 80's era piece of technology. No import, no backup of numbers, nothing. The manuals are also tiny and sparse.<br /><br />Here's the kicker: It doesn't actually appear to spammers unless you manually block them once!  What it does is play a robot voice and asks people to press zero, so its relying on your setup and the caller's ethics to determine if the call goes through. That means that a telemarketer can easily add themselves to your white list.  Read that again: telemarketers can add themselves to your white list without your permission.  NEAT.<br /><br />SETUP:<br /><br />It took me all of 2 hours to manually use the little up and down arrows to get 34 numbers in there and it froze up twice. I had to remove all the cables and batteries to get it going again.  NOT FRIENDLY FOR SENIORS.  I got this for my parents and there is no way they could have endured that interface - the delete key is also the home key, it requires 3 seconds of holding when its in a &#34;restful state&#34; to get into the whitelist, and there is no visual distinction between browsing the white list (which has no caller id, by the way, good luck remembering if someone's in there)<br /><br />If you have family members who don't speak english the pre-recorded voices are going to sound like they dialed the wrong number. There is no way to personalize the greeting or hide the option to press zero. If you are buying this as a &#34;set and forget&#34; thing for seniors imagine what's going to happen when they need a new number to get through and you're not there, or you're traveling.  Basically unless they live with you, forget about it.<br /><br />You also can't wall-mount it, and there's no constant battery indicator. UGH. Our main phone is in the kitchen so I can't set it on the counter.  I had to put it near the internet router where nobody ever is, so that means I'll be using the white/black list buttons after the fact.  On the bright side it does alert you when you've not determined if incoming numbers are white or blacklisted, and those DO show caller IDs.  That's a neat feature.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />This thing is a chore to setup and a small ongoing chore to maintain, but I think will be helpful in stopping the automated pre-recorded spam calls I get that won't press zero to get through. Despite freezing up on setup (it says how to unfreeze it in the manual, they're aware this is a problem) the device has an attractive and solid build quality. It looks like its going to last us for years.  I'm not thrilled with it, but for the price its expected.",3,True

I wanted a Desktop replacement that was also very portable and this is Light and Portable. Battery Life is about 4 hours, but finding a replacement 10.95V 3-cell 2675mAh Battery has been difficult. The i5 Intel processor versions use a 14.75V 4-cell battery and there are lots of those around. Would I buy it again? Yes but the $100 more i5 version for the larger battery and a slightly faster processor.",0,False
5,"Amazingly QUIET. Better than Intel's. Contrary to another review, compatible w i7 of 35 watt",I feel the need to clarify what another reviewer posted re 3vs4 pin connectors. It's clearly stated as 3 pin for CPU with watt&lt;95.  The i7 6700T is 35W so it's compatible. The 4th pin is for adjustable fan speeds.  It's like flipping the lights on or off rather than adjusting the brightness w a rheostat.  This should not be given one star because someone can't read the description.<br /><br />Fan is QUIET and can't be heard within case<br /><br />Requires back plate=better. Replaced my intel setup due to flimsy pushpin break. Screwing the heatsink down=better cooling.  If I use another pushpin it will be too soon.<br /><br />You can't forget the thermal paste because it's pre applied!<br /><br />Better cooling than Intel (tested with HWmonitor and Prime95).  I even can run this at full Prime95 without the cpu fan in the low 70s with i5 2400 (a 95 watt torch).<br /><br />I'm quietly cool and happy.,0,False

5,Intel I5 661 Processor,"This became the processor of choice for an upgrade build for my daughter and son-in-law. We installed this chip on a GIGABYTE GA-H55-USB3 LGA 1156 Intel HDMI USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard, 4 gigs of G-Skill DDR3 1333 ram, Powered by an Antec NEO ECO 520C 520W Continuous Power ATX12V v2.3 / EPS12V 80 PLUS Certified Active PFC Power Supply, and all of it went into a shiny new Thermaltake V3 Black Edition case. The operating system is Windows 7 Professional.  Incidentally, we purchased the processor through Amazon, but the other components were purchased at another retailer. The purchase through Amazon was a little more expensive, but competitive, and they had it in stock for immediate shipping.<br /><br />We built this machine as a versatile daily workhorse in office applications, video editing and music compilations, internet surfing and entertainment.  With hyper-threading and turboboost technology, this processor never gets overworked and operation is smooth whether burning videos, music or watching movies.  Not having to purchase a video card for this build was a plus and since this machine is not a gamer, the on-die HD graphics, rated at 900mhz base frequency, delivers a stunning video experience that does not disappoint.<br /><br />The processor overclocks nicely and I have oc'd it into the 3.8Ghz range, but, again, since it is not a gamer there is no real reason to maintain that level of performance.  The fan and heatsink is included in this purchase and you will sometimes hear how the stock fan and heatsink is sub-par, according to those ""in the know.""  I'm here to tell you that the stock fan and heatsink does a fine job of keeping this processor cool and stable under ""normal"" computing operations.  However, if you are an avid overclocker and are trying to get past that 4 gig barrier, then yes, an aftermarket cooler is a must.<br /><br />Overall, this is processor is fast, runs cool, and brings with it a level of computing satisfaction not before realized.  On-die graphics, rock solid performance and price makes this chip a great choice for  mainstream computing needs.",2,True

Voice recognition was difficult due to an excess of mid frequencies and room reverberation in the 200 to 400 hz range.  I listened to a number of different soundbars for my home and found the JBL's to have the brightest and crispest sound. The sub is a little larger and cleaner than others at this price point. Other reviewers have complained about their lack of mid range, but I found it to be especially beneficial.  My only complaint is its Auto on feature.  My TIVO box has no on-off switch,; it's producing sound all of the time.  The soundbar detects it and turns on. There is no override to this function.

5,Great motherboard and cpu for the price using latest Intel CPUs,"This was a specialized purchase based on features of the CPU. The CPU feature we were interested in was Intel's SHA instruction extensions, which help accelerate cryptographic operations. The extensions are new to the Goldmont micro-architecture, so there's no too much available in selection at the moment. This board/cpu combination is one of three choices on Amazon at the moment (November  2016).<br /><br />The ASUS motherboard and cpu combination is very nice. It was paired with 8 GB of RAM and a 64 GB SSD. The processor is a tad bit slow for a desktop at 1.5 GHz, but we found it bench-marked well given its capabilities. The BIOS (UEFI) is especially nifty with the point-and-click dashboard. It was intuitive and easy to disable Secure Boot so non-Windows OSes could be loaded.<br /><br />I found Ubuntu 14 was a turd due to its down-level kernel. It took 3 minutes for the Ubuntu 14 kernel to boot. The machine really boots quickly under a Ubuntu 16 kernel. The Ubuntu 16 kernel loads in a fraction of a second, and you are ready to login in a few seconds. I was not able to get a Debian 8 ISO to load, and I did not investigate further since I knew Ubuntu would boot the machine.<br /><br />All-in-all, we are happy with the board, processor and its performance. Its a great combination for feature testing the latest Intel CPUs given the price. The board and cpu combination is priced lower than Intel recommends for the CPU alone. It will make a very good machine for cruising the internet and checking email.",3,True

It is well noted that the more expensive cards with the Texas Instrument chip sets have the best compatibility and success rate, but at a premium.<br />I plugged it in, Windows loaded the drivers automatically and it was up and going.<br />I am using an older ADS ADI-550 to convert VHS tapes to digital stream. This works great , having captured some 25 hours of video thus far.<br />I am using Sony Vegas Pro 13 and did this professionally before my retirement.<br />I might note for others seeking this as a solution for VHS and other analog transfers, you will need a TBC (Time Base Corrector) to capture as DV or 8 bit video.  And you need software that will capture the video as proper interlace format. I do not recommend using something like OBS which only captures as progressive scan, unless you are fond of interlace artifacts.<br />So,  if you experience dropped frames and such, it is not the card, but the lack of TBC.<br />Pinnacle's software has time base correction, but only if you capture as MPEG-2. Sadly it reverses the field order and will also result in interlace artifacts.  Again, not the FireWire card's issue.<br />It has been a pleasant experience to use my hardware without issue right out of the box.<br />I highly recommend this card for anyone seeking a low-cost solution to add FireWire to their existing PC tower.",2,True

5,Mini PC Fanless Intel Celeron N4000 (up to 2.6GHz) 4GB DDR/64GB eMMC Mini Desktop Computer,"Mini PC Fan less Intel Celeron N4000 (up to 2.6GHz) 4GB DDR/64GB eMMC Mini Desktop Computer<br />I  bought this mini computer for a couple reasons, I wanted a computer that did not need a fan (which wear out over time) and I wanted to smarten up my DUMB led TV.<br /> - Out of the box, it is PHYSICALLY SMALL., I would guess about 6"" x 6"" x 1"".  It is light so if you need to handle it or change plugs often, you will want to mount it in some manner as it is very light.<br /> - It does include the power supply and hanger bracket for behind the tv.<br /> - It comes with 4gb RAM<br /> - It comes with a small SSD drive.  If you know anything about SSD drives, they have a limited life as everytime you write to them, they lose ability to write to the memory.  Over time this ""resistance"" to be written to builds up and the drive will stop functioning.  This is common with all memory drives.<br />To prolong the drives life, especially if you plan to write to it a great deal, is to get the largest SSD you can afford so it has more memory to share the ""write wear"" over.<br />It appears that an HDD or a conventional hard drive is not an option so be aware of how you plan to use this.<br /> - I have a computer with the Atom processor, and I admit they are a work horse.  I actually ran my netbook with the Atom processor, as a regular computer and it was able to do everything I wanted it to do.  Clearly the Atom is not intended for that kind of work out but it was successful with little problems.  The Atom is a good processor for what it is intended for.<br /> - This unit has the Celeron, another processor I am aware of as I had it in my All in One desk top.  Again, a good processor, works hard as long as it has a good operating system in it, mine had the Win 98 which cause some concerns from time to time.<br /> - If you are used to the INTEL BIOs, the Mini PC Bios is different.  It works about the same, most may not even notice the difference.  But the instructions, which I would say is a hair above minimal information, do not tell you how to get into the BIOS.  During boot up you hold down the ESC key to get into the BIOS screen.<br /> - This machine comes with the Win10 Op Sys ready to be installed.  If you like Win10, this should be no problem.  I wanted to run Linux from the thumb drive which brings on some interesting start ups.<br /> - First, Even with the BIOs changed so it looks at the Thumb drive FIRST, it always attempts to start up the Win10 install on the main drive.<br />IF THERE IS AN ALTERNATE KEY to direct the start up to the Thumb drive, the instructions do not tell you how to do that.  On IBM or LENOVO which use Intel BIOS, hitting Enter when instructed then F12 will direct you to your startup device.  It is still a mystery how to direct it on this machine.<br /> - after you stop the Win10 install, you have to pull the power to erase memory to be able to restart again and it may be directed to the thumb drive, or it may go back to the Win10 install screen again.<br />THIS IS CLEARLY MY BIGGEST GRIPE with this mini computer.<br /><br /> - MY PROS<br />-has 4 gb RAM<br />-It is small in size, about 6"" x 6"" x 1"" and is very light.  You can't depend on the computers weight to hold it in place, even a cord to a keyboard can drag it off the desk.<br />-If you place it flat on the desk top surface, put some rubber feet on the bottom.  There are air vents on top and bottom,  sides so you need to keep this area clear for some air flow.<br />-The Celeron processor runs beautifully.  Once you get your operating system up and running, you will not notice much if any difference from using a regular desk top.<br />-It comes with Win10 ready to be installed by you.  I can't offer any thoughts on this as I don't run Win10.<br />-It runs all the different flavors of  - Linux, - ubuntu and - Debian operating systems that I have tried.  They all run perfectly.<br />- you get 3 USB 3 ports, a power port, VGA and HDMI port, Mic and headphone port.<br />-If you will be using it for a desk top, the 3 usb3 ports should be enough but it will handle a usb Hub if needed.<br />-Big Plus for me was NO FAN NEEDED for cooling.  This means no fans to wear out which allows this to be used for music play, animations, and of course for smartening up your dumb TV.<br /><br />I Recommend this Mini Computer.  OVERLOOKING the USB startup concern for alternate Operating systems, as it may be something I missed, I would recommend this Mini Computer.  I was happy with its small foot print that can fit just about anywhere, the great function of the Celeron Processor and its ability to run LINUX, ubuntu and Debian Distros with no problem it runs and performs almost exactly like your desktop/laptop at home.<br /><br />I do not know the seller and did not receive any money or merchandise for my random review.<br />200628 1318",1,True

5,Crucial MX500 1TB - Worked well and is Faster than my older Intel 180 SSD,"I have always (25 years) bought Crucial memory and storage devices for my PC's and to upgrade for friends.  They make very good and reliable products.  I would pay a bit extra to get this name-brand, tested, quality product.  The drive installed in the bundled bracket easily and the process went well (for an experienced PC person).  I needed to change the BIOS settings to get the drive recognized (Legacy Order of Boot).  I tried to install the Acronis Disk Clone program, but it would not run/install due to this error.  It had an error of ""Already at Latest Level"" and would not continue to load.  Windows did recognize the drive in Disk Manager, and it was ready to be used.  I was lucky to have Acronis 2016 that I could install and use easily.  It installed this drive with Acronis, and it picked MBR as a Format type.  I did want to try GPT, but my PC (HP Z420) might not be capable.  The Cloning went quickly and worked great.  I also used the Crucial Storage Executive and turned on the two features to increase speed (does take about 70 to 100GB).  Drive worked fine and Windows seemed to accept the Clone.  Looking online there are a number of people who had trouble with the Crucial Acronis Software, this seems to be a problem.  This was not an easy swap and it took several hours due to the problems.<br />After install (clone) I started getting a CHKDSK being run automatically.

5,Upgrade from Intel PRO/100 VE Desktop Adapter,"My Dell Dimension E510 desktop had the PRO/100 VE desktop adapter as its NIC, which worked just fine. I was upgrading my E510 from XP to Windows 7 and wanted a new Ethernet card so I chose the Gigabit CT Desktop Adapter. I had PROSet software installed along with the driver for the PRO/100 VE.<br /><br />Some helpful instructions for those that want to upgrade your driver or install a new Ethernet card; With PROSet, you must first remove your current adapter from the PROSet software BEFORE uninstalling PROSet and the current driver. If you don't you may end up with a phantom adapter that causes problems when you try to install a new version of PROSet and an updated driver.<br /><br />I installed the Gigabit CT card while still running XP. I had a free PCI-Express (x1) slot, which made installing the new card easy. During system startup I entered Setup and disabled the PRO/100 VE NIC and then proceeded with the rest of startup. I then installed a new version of PROSet and a new driver that I downloaded from Intel's web site. I didn't have to reboot after installing the software. The card just worked.<br /><br />When I upgraded from XP to Windows 7, the OS recognized the Gigabit CT card and installed drivers automatically so I didn't have to worry about downloading and installing a driver after installing the OS. The only thing is that Windows 7 didn't install PROSet, which is optional software anyway so it's not required.<br /><br />My house is wired with CAT5 instead of CAT5e or CAT6 so I really don't get the benefit of having a Gigabit network adapter. My VPN router is not a Gigabit router. It's only rated at 75Mbps. With my current Comcast service I'm getting about 25Mbps download and 4Mbps upload, which is about the same as I was getting with the PRO/100 VE NIC so having a Gigabit card isn't making any difference for me.<br /><br />However, the card works flawlessly and I'm very pleased with it. If you're wired with CAT5e or CAT6 and have Gigabit network equipment I would highly recommend the CT Desktop Adapter. It's a great Ethernet card, easy to install, works with Windows 7, and it provides great performance even in a non-Gigabit environment. You can download the latest PROSet and driver from Intel's web site.",3,True

5,"Works with MX Duo, MS Ergo Keyboard 4000/Intellimouse Optical","I had my eye on this KVM switch because I saw on the Logitech.com forum that this product worked with the wireless MX Duo keyboard/mouse combo. Now that I have this switch, I can tell you that it works with the MX Duo as a previous reviewer stated, including all extra buttons on the keyboard and mouse. I'm running the video at a resolution of 1024x768 and all is well.<br />As for the audio, it wasn't nearly as bad as I expected it to be based on previous reviews. I suppose it did sound a little thin, but I would've had to be paying close attention to notice. And anyway, I didn't buy this for the audio, because I'd rather have audio from both computers at all times instead of having the audio switch along with the video. For this reason, I don't even use the audio feature of this KVM.<br /><br />UPDATE: 1/2/06<br />I got tired of the MX Duo and ditched it in favor of the new (as if this writing) MS Ergo Keyboard 4000 and the MS Intellimoues Optical. (After using the crappy Logitech MX700 mouse for about a year, I REALLY missed my Intellimouse.) The Intellimouse works great with all buttons functional (though the left thumb button does tend to 'stick' every once in a blue moon).<br />When I hooked up the Ergo 4000 keyboard to my PC (without the KVM), I was dismayed to find that it didn't work during the bootup sequence. But when I hooked it up the KVM, it actually worked as it is supposed to. So in this case, the keyboard worked better connected to the KVM than it did natively .. go figure :) The only caveat is that when you switch from one machine to another using the 4000 keyboard on this KVM, the 'device connect/disconnect' sound goes off in WIndows XP (and maybe other versions too), so if you switch back and forth often, you'll want to disable these two sounds in the Windows control panel.",6,False
2,Intellipoint software takes a step back,"I was about to go out and buy this new keyboard and mouse combo, but I decided to try out the new Intellipoint software version 5.0 before doing so, and I'm glad I did!<br />For those that don't know, Intellipoint is the software the controls MS mice. I am currently using IP v4.2 with my Intellimouse Opitcal and when I 'upgraded' to version 5.0 (which comes with all newere MS mice), I was shocked to find that they REMOVED certain features! First of all, you no longer have the ability to customize the mouse buttons at the application level. This may not seem like a big deal if you've never had this capability, but once you've gotten used to it, it's hard to be without. Another thing is that the scroll wheel no longer works with certain applications (such as Visual Basic 6), even though version 4.2 worked great. I've also had issues trying to map keystrokes to the left and right mouse buttons, and other people have reported some stability issues with the 5.0 version.<br />The only thing I can guess is that somebody at MS was smoking the phatty on this one. And it's really a shame too, because the Intellipoint software was really the only advantage that MS mice had over Logitech's offerings. Basically, I would recommend this package ONLY if they update the intellipoint drivers to add back in the features that they (for whatever reason) removed. I sure hope they do because I really want this keyboard and mouse!<br />(NOTE: I've heard that you can run version 4.2 of Intellipoint with this package, but you can't use the horrizontal scroll. I've personally never tried it.)",5,False
1,Research Intel C2000 bug !!!!,"Bottom Line:  Intel produced defective CPUs -- the entire Intel Atom 2000 lineup.

As this defect is in a CPU soldered onto the board (a SOC), it is not easily fixed by the skilled / informed consumer/owner.  There have been some success stories of users soldering a 100 Ohm resistor onto pins 1 and 6 of the board, and resurrecting their dead NAS, but should a consumer really need to resort to a soldering iron to fix a known manufacturing defect?

5,"Tests show very good signal reception, work with 802.11AC standard and Intel PCIe mini wifi cards.","I tested these antennas against the stock antenna that came with a Gigabyte desktop WIFI kit using an Intel 8260 mini card for 2.4,and  5Ghz and Bluetooth 4.2.  This kit is the new 802.11 AC spec, and needs a 2Rx2T  (two time receive and two times transmit) antenna that also supports bluetooth 4.2 spec.<br /><br />Performance of the Gigabyte antenna is good, it maxes out the 100Mbps Optimum cable service I have over wifi.  Tests with both antennas showed 115Mbps down, 37Mbps up on the 5Ghz connection, and a little less on the 2.4Ghz connection.  The desktop is in the next room from the Optimum router (802.11AC spec) so results are good with both antennas.<br /><br />There is a significant difference in Link Speed,, Signal Strength and DBI between them that makes me think the TECHTOO antennas will perform better when farther away or signal starts to degrade.<br /><br />TECHTOO 5Ghz Link Speed 520 Mbps, Signal Strength 80%, DBI -60. (with DBI lower number is a stronger, better signal)<br />Gigabyte 5Ghz Link Speed 390Mbps, Signal Strength 80%, DBI -65 (still a good signal, but the TECHTOO has better reception)<br /><br />TECHTOO 2.4Ghz Link Speed 144 Mbps, Signal Strength 99%, DBI -39. ( very strong signall)<br />Gigabyte 2.4Ghz Link Speed 144Mbps, Signal Strength 93%, DBI -55 (still a good signal, but the TECHTOO has better reception).<br /><br />So, the TECHTOO signal numbers show that they are pulling in a better quality signal than the stock Gigabyte antenna.  The farther away ore more radio noise there is the TECHTOO should perform better.  And the TECHTOO has 130Mbps faster Link Speed, meaning if I had faster internet service, the TECHTOO antennas would have better/higher speed tests than the Gigabyte.<br /><br />Another very important item was the Bluetooth 4.2 performance.  Photo's loaded faster from my Samsung S5 to the desktop with the TECHTOO antennas through bluetooth.  And there was no problems with the Intel 8260 mini card picking up wifi signals when bluetooth was on (a problem when testing regular dual band 6dbi antennas).  All features of the Gigabyte mini card worked with the TECHTOO antennas.  So if you have 802.11AC spec router and Desktop PCIe wifi cards these antennas are the way to go.",13,True

Third, and most important, it does a fantastic job keeping processors cool in these tiny little cases. I use it for builds in the Realan E-i5 (75mm high) and E-K3 (72mm tall) which are very small mini-ITX cases. For the E-K3, that the cooler uses the standard mounts is very important because the backplate on other coolers interferes with the VESA mount while the T459 does not interfere at all.<br /><br />The only con is the way the fan is mounted. It's screwed into the heatsink from underneath meaning if it does fail and need to be changed, the heatsink will need to be removed.<br /><br />For Intel builds in these mini-ITX cases I will use no other as long as these are available. I've found nothing quieter or better cooling in this size at this price. Perfect!",13,True
5,Perfect 19V adapter for Intel DH61AG,"I bought two of these to use with the [[ASIN:B0057D8DVI Intel DH61AG mini-itx motherboard]] and they are perfect for this. This Intel motherboard has an on-board DC-DC power supply and takes a 7.4mm * 5.0mm plug. Since these computer builds are only using a i3-2120T, 8GB RAM, optical drive and SSD drive, 90W is more than enough. Maximum power draw is around 60W. Unlike a lot of other after-market AC adapters I've used I didn't find this one getting hot, merely warm to the touch. I have also used other Anker AC adapters in the past with picoPSUs so I know this is a good brand and this set continues that trend.<br /><br />This is the mini-ITX HTPC build using these adapters:<br /><br />IWill S197-H80 mini-itx HTPC case<br />Intel DH61AG mini-itx motherboard<br />Intel i3-2120T CPU<br />Dynatron K199 1U CPU cooler<br />8GB (2 x 4GB) G-Skill DDR3-1333 SO-DIMM RAM<br />Crucial mSATA 64GB SSD<br />Sony BC-5600S slot-load blu-ray ODD<br />Anker 19V 90W AC adapter<br /><br />It appears this would also work with the [[ASIN:B00840BACU Intel DQ77KB mini-itx motherboard]].

4,"Good, basic motherboard; Intel HD driver/HDMI issues","I purchased this motherboard as a cheap upgrade to my existing livingroom HTPC which was AMD based and not capable of bitstreaming DTS-MA HD and Dolby True-HD over HDMI.  I was attracted by the price, support for Sandy Bridge processors, HDMI and no frills like USB3.0 and SATA III which I did not want to pay extra for and not use.<br /><br />It was easy to setup, even more so since I also own the very good mini-ITX version and I am familiar with the driver CD. The motherboard is very well laid-out and almost spacious.  I've always liked the ASUS blue color scheme (yes, even though it's hidden away in a case, I liked it).  All the video options are covered: VGA, DVI and HDMI.  This would make a very good inexpensive desktop board.  The included driver disk is necessary and it tries to install some bloatware but if the InstallAll option is selected, on the next screen it's possible to opt-out of things like Norton. There are only 2 USB headers so I have front USB ports that I cannot hook up now -- something I should have research better. Also, like the mini-ITX, there is no way to keep the power LED from blinking when in S3 sleep. That's not so great for an HTPC.<br /><br />The biggest problem I've had with this board is that with using the HDMI port, necessary in my home theater setup (only HDMI supports the HD audio bitstreams), I cannot upgrade the Intel HD video driver past the version downloaded from the ASUS website.  Except for the most recent version from the Intel website, which sticks at 1024x768 no matter what, the Intel driver install BSODs and so do subsequent reboots.  I am able to recover by booting into safe mode and reinstalling the driver from the ASUS website.  Users of other brand boards I've talked to (usually Intel) are not having this issue and some searching via Google shows this to be a common complaint when using HDMI.  My desire to update the video driver is driven by poor deinterlacing performance watching Live TV, especially NFL Football.  My ultimate solution has been to put my HIS HD5670 card back in.  If you don't need HDMI support then this will likely not be an issue for you.  It's something to be aware of for HTPC builders.  I am going to keep taking BIOS updates and trying the Intel HD driver updates hoping at some point this will get fixed.  Maybe ASUS will release an updated video driver.<br /><br />Pros:<br />No issues with install.<br />UEFI bios is nice.<br />Board is simple and well laid out.<br />Excellent price.<br />No frills.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Intel video HD driver issues using HDMI<br />Only two USB headers.<br />No way to disable blinking power LED in sleep<br />ASUS driver CD wants to install Norton and some other bloatware (just use InstallAll and then it'll let you unselect them)<br /><br />Setup:<br />ASUS H61 mobo<br />i3-2100 CPU<br />MicroCenter 64GB SSD<br />WD 40GB SATA drive (Recorded TV buffer)<br />1 x 2GB DDR3 1333 RAM<br />Lite-On Bluray ODD<br />Antec EA380D PSU<br />nMediaPC 1000b case w/ LCD<br />Hauppauge Win-TV 1250 tuner card",3,False

5,One of the best but far from cheap (reviewing the Intel Core i3-5015U model),"[[VIDEOID:f3f275a51f2ee6c1e1523e561ab81d63]] [[VIDEOID:869db9e37839a8f1da377b5c17307965]] NOTE:<br /><br />Please be aware that I am reviewing the Intel Core i3-5015U model which is not the same as the Intel Celeron 3215U. Amazon sometimes bundles reviews for what they believe are similar products into one pile of reviews, probably because they believe that 'more reviews' is better but, in my view, this can be confusing.<br /><br />NOTE ON THE VIDEO:<br /><br />It's probably not the best quality video ever but I am only trying to show how this Chromebook can stream and play videos from 3 different sources simultaneously: Netflix, Yahoo and a news channel without breaking a sweat. The clicks come from the wireless mouse. Also note how quickly it loads my Amazon page while three other videos are running. Quite impressive.<br /><br />By the way, the Octane score for this Chromebook is 21,453 (average of 5 runs)<br />___________________________________________________________<br /><br />I am not in the habit of writing over-enthusiastic reviews and I totally believe that my mission as a Vine reviewer is to help my fellow customers (I don't like the term 'consumers') make better informed decisions by helping them cut through the fog of marketing and presenting a product's qualities and defects as they are. So, these being said, I was a little skeptical when I agreed to review Toshiba's latest Chromebook 2 because 'Chromebooks' to me translate into 'about $200' when it comes to price and this one sells for twice as much but, here I am, absolutely wow'ed if that's a word, by what seems to be one of the most amazing Chromebooks ever or at least the best I've had the opportunity to try so far. But, let me explain why I believe that this Chromebook is worth its high price.<br /><br />MIND-BLOWING:<br />- Backlit keyboard: yes, I place this as the 'number one' feature because I've always wished that my Chromebooks had one so this is a dream come true. I keep a Chromebook on my bedside table and often I work on emails late at night and I just love the ability to simply press Alt+Screen_brightness key to light it up and let me do the work.<br />- The display: yes, it's a true 1920x1080. I was and I still am happy with the standard 1366x768 found on most Chromebooks so the better resolution makes me... more than happy? But it's not just resolution. This is the crispest, most brilliant, color rich screens I've seen in a Chromebook. And that's not all. The viewing angle is close to the perfect 180 degrees. It's probably 170 degrees but, you get the idea. This Chromebook's display is beautiful.<br />- Speed: a 2.1 GHz Intel Core i3-5015U is not the fastest Intel has ever made but on a Chromebook, because of its natively low overhead it translates into satisfyingly 'fast'. It simply runs rings around the other Chromebooks we keep in the house.<br /><br />GREAT:<br />- 802.11ac: if 300Mbps is not fast enough then... 802.11ac can get a little faster, to about 450Mbps. This is our second Chromebook that supports 802.11ac standard and, thanks to the faster processor, it can take better advantage of it.<br />- 13.3&#34; screen: (vs. 11.6&#34; for 'classic' Chromebooks) bigger is not always better but, in this case, given the excellent resolution and display quality, it's just great.<br />- Skin: it's probably plastic but it's good quality, with a titanium-like, rugged finish that's totally fingerprint-proof and looks super-cool.<br /><br />AS EXPECTED:<br />- 4GB or RAM: it's okay and Chromebooks work well with this amount of memory.<br />- I/O: USB 2.0, USB 3.0, HDMI out (full size), headphone jack, memory card reader. No complaints whatsoever.<br />- Keyboard: as expected. Good for doing emails, probably not good enough if you are planning to write a 300-page novel.<br />- Trackpad: is good. Most Chromebooks have good trackpads.<br />- Battery life: 8 hours claimed, more like 5-6 hours in my 'real life' tests and that's good enough.<br />- Camera, internal stereo mic: good, no complaints.<br />- Bluetooth: doesn't everybody?<br />- Weight: at 2.9 lbs is where a 13.3&#34; Chromebook is expected to be.<br />- Google incentives: 100GB in the cloud for 2 years, some complimentary airplane usage deal.<br /><br />DISAPPOINTING:<br />- Dedicated charger: I am still spoiled by that HP Chromebook 11 of a couple of years ago that could be charged through a USB port which, by the way, my wife is still using and she just loves it. This Toshiba, like most other Chromebooks comes with its own, dedicated (little) power brick so it's a small disappointment.<br /><br />As far as my experience with the product, the first adjective that comes to mind is 'flawless'. I didn't time it but I'm sure it took less than 5 minutes between pressing the power button, connecting to Wi-Fi and entering my email address and password for the Chromebook to be activated, fully updated to the latest Chrome OS version and to have all my extensions and shortcuts loaded and ready to go, giving me my full, familiar Chromebook interface, only faster and brighter in this case. It is able to handle Netflix, Youtube and some streaming news channel and it's like is asking for more. The keyboard is what it is: chiclets but well made and the backlit makes all the difference in the world.<br /><br />Without a doubt in my mind, Google's own Pixel aside (which is way overdone) this is the best Chromebook I've ever experienced and this is coming from someone who, if anything, is not a friend of Toshiba as I had some issue with a laptop under warranty a few years ago and I did not appreciate how I was treated. But I have to be objective so, yes, it's a great product.<br /><br />___________________________________________________________<br /><br />THOUGHTS ON CHROMEBOOKS<br /><br />Those who already use Chromebooks probably don't need to read this but for anyone new to Chromebooks, please be aware that this is NOT a Windows laptop. It's probably worth Googling (or Binging) 'Chromebook' before deciding on getting one but, here are some of my thoughts on the matter.<br /><br />Why a Chromebook?<br /><br />There's so much to say here but let me make a quick summary. And never forget that we are talking about a not so expensive device here because, yes, anything that costs 3-4-5 times as much should do SOMETHING better or very few of us would pay more for such devices.<br /><br />' My Chromebooks is by far my most used computers in the house excluding work hours and by 'computer' I mean PCs, laptops and tablets.<br />' They are malware, spyware, adware-free. Since nothing is really 'installed' on a Chromebook and not much is physically stored on it, it would be very hard for one to be infected. It is now my habit to open suspicious emails or click on dubious URLs on Chromebooks only, never on a phone, laptop or tablet.<br />' Extremely safe OS. I don't know if this is common knowledge but Google is constantly challenging hackers to crack their OS. As far as I know, Chrome OS wasn't cracked yet.<br />' Easy to share among any number of users without any concerns of compromising privacy. If you have a Google account, you simply sign in and you are going to be within your own, personal environment in seconds and it all goes away once you sign out or turn your Chromebook off.<br />' Constantly updated and upgraded. Google updates Chrome OS every few weeks and I found my Chromebooks actually getting better all the time rather than slowly fall into obsolescence.<br />' Nearly maintenance free. Whenever I don't use a tablet or even a laptop for a while, they tend to get very busy once I turn them back on, downloading and installing various patches, updates and upgrades. Not the case for Chromebooks. Whatever upgrades may take place they don't hit my Chromebook. Whenever I call up an app, I get it in its latest version.<br />' The attached keyboard helps a lot. Yes, you can pair a keyboard and even a mouse to a tablet but the Chromebook's keyboard is always there, it negates the need of a stand or even some protecting case.<br />' Chrome OS is streamlined and efficiently focused where it matters, on the everyday uses most of us need a 'computer' most of the time.<br />' Chrome OS being such a streamlined one, browsing and running apps on a Chromebook is faster than off a PC/laptop/tablet of equivalent specs.<br />' Relatively low price,  excellent display and lightweight seem to be just about right for something that typically you'd be using to browse the Web while watching TV or take to and from school.<br /><br />Why not a Chromebook?<br /><br />Yes, Chromebooks can't do everything. Google's productivity suites notwithstanding, Chromebooks are best at media consumption rather than production. Nobody should buy a Chromebook and expect to be able to edit video for a living or do some hard-core gaming. There are other machines and devices better suited for such tasks. My experience is that a Chromebook can't do 'everything'. Tablets are more portable, PCs and laptops are more powerful and versatile but, to me, my Chromebook is the most fun to use and it's likely to stay this way. I am not going to call it my 'second' or 'third' or 'first' computer but, objectively, it's the one I most use outside business hours if what we measure is 'hours'.",278,False

5,Intelligently Engineered and Surprisingly Solid,"Just arrived today and I am impressed. First, by the fact that it did arrive today, a mere ten days after ordering from China. I am on the West Coast, but still that's great processing and shipping.<br /><br />More importantly, I'm impressed by the fit and finish. The three parts feel beautifully machined and absolutely solid together. As an example, the L bracket has two protruding short cylinders that fit into receptacles on the bottom plate. They are so precise that the L bracket stays there without using the screw. Of course you still use the screw, but attachment feels really solid and it's really easy to screw on since you can use the other hand to hold the camera, not the bracket.<br /><br />As you can see in the photos, the bottom plate acts as a giant Acra Swiss plate, as does the L-bracket. This is crucial, of course, and makes your rig the tiniest bit lighter, as you don't need a quick release plate. According to my scale, the entire assembly weighs 115.4 grams. Minus the L-bracket and screw, 90.9 grams. Oh, yes, I can confirm the battery comes out easily with the grip on. The mic and HDMI ports are accesible and the screen can articulate out to about 170 degrees (though beyond 90 degrees it cannot articulate up or down) with the L-bracket attached. (But, seriously, I can't foresee needing the screen to articulate in these ways when the camera is attached to a tripod with the L-bracket.)<br /><br />As for feel, here's my only complaint: the gap between the right hand grip and the lens is small. With the 40-150mm lens, there's just enough room for my fingers to clear the lens barrel. With the 12-40mm, there isn't. It's still usable with my ring finger below the widest part of the barrel and my middle finger above it, but just barely and my fingers are not thick. If you don't have relatively narrow fingers, you cannot use this with Olympus's PRO series lenses (or, for sure, 4/3 or APS or FF lenses).<br /><br />Aside from that issue—and it's a big one—this grip is just great. Just be careful about the lens/finger gap: for you it might get one star. I'm giving it five because it works for me. And now I've told *you*, so dont buy it and give it one star! Caveat emptor. For everyone else: this grip is a steal.",13,True
4,"at last, the solution from Intel is here","I bought this drive on july 6  2011 and I still have not dared to install on my laptop. As soon as I ordered it I went to the Intel web site to download the last firmware to have everything ready for the installation. Checking the support forum I read many post written since june 1 2011 about a fatal flaw in this series. By the end of july Intel acknowleged the flaw as ""Bad Context 13x Error"" and today august 5 I still have the drive sealed on its package waiting for the solution from Intel (I don't want to use a SSD with few months of life span). At this point I regret to have sold my Intel X25 drive to buy this one supposedly with an improved reliability.<br /><br />*** UPDATE AUGUST 22 2011 ****<br />Intel finally released the new firmware so I updated my drive, let's hope this solution will be permanent. I give two more stars to the product because this drive is as fast as the X25M that I had but I dont know about its reliability, and so far so good.",6,True
4,Switched over to Kaby Lake Intel from AMD,"Let me start by saying that I like AMD.  I have bought lots of their products over the years-- cpus, gpus, and more recently apus.  They've always had good price to performance ratio.  I want them to succeed; I want healthy competition with Intel.<br /><br />However, when my last PC rig (Phenom II x6 w/ Radeon 6970 from 2011) turned 6 years old this January it was time for an upgrade and Intel Skylake and the brand new Kabylake were the only shows in town.  Though I had bought some great Kaveri apus in recent years for budget 1080p HTPCs, AMD in general felt really stale and my most recent build had actually been an i3  skylake for a pfsense router.  But when the announcement of March release for Ryzen 7 came I certainly felt like I could wait another 60 days to see what the long awaited Ryzen offered.<br /><br />In short, what a disappointment.  My main rig is used for gaming, software development, and light video editing.  AMD kept claiming that Ryzen would go head to head with Intel's best and beat it with its price.  And, that's true if your use cases are multi-core with heavy graphics editing or various academic algorithms.  But it still fell short of the i7-7700k for single-threaded scenarios (which applies to many apps).  Sure, it's great that Ryzen performs as well as and costs half as much as a $1k Haswell but I was never going to spend a $1k on a CPU so that's neither here nor there.  What really bothered me was their highlighting of gaming benchmarks where the CPU wasn't the bottleneck.  Who cares if Ryzen 7 can perform as well as an i7 when the GPU is the bottleneck because you're gaming in 4k or 1440p?  Why would I pay $150 more for an 1800x that was inferior in many scenarios to the best i7?<br /><br />Furthermore, many professional reviewers easily found flaws with the Ryzen 7 (including a bizarre performance drop off at 1080p gaming).  When they brought those to the attention of AMD, they were told to disable features in the bios to improve things.  Disable features in my bios to improve performance?  WTF?  What kind of a weak response is that?  That shows a clear... no disturbing ... lack of preparedness on AMD's part to things that they had to have known professional reviewers were going to test.<br /><br />After having read a dozen or so professional reviews of Ryzen 7 all saying the same thing: 'looks promising but has warts and is clearly inferior to i7 in multiple use cases'.  I just couldn't pull the trigger on AMD.  They weren't ready.<br /><br />So, I took the safe route.  I went i7-7700k.  No regrets ... but godspeed to AMD and here's hoping they can get some real competition against Intel.",4,True

5,Another great Intel processor,"BACKGROUND: I'm a software developer and have built and used many computers.<br /><br />Not sure what to say except that I think this is another great Intel processor. Fast, reliable, and low power.<br /><br />The value of this chip is what stands out to me. I usually prefer (for most of my systems) to by a mid-range processor. I feel you get the best bang for your buck if you stick to the middle, but everyone's needs are different so a slower/cheaper or faster/more expensive CPU may be better for you, but this CPU is a good middle-of-the-road value.<br /><br />I'm using it in a Linux server machine with this motherboard: [[ASIN:B00D12OANW MSI Computer Corp. Motherboard ATX DDR3 1333 LGA 1150 Motherboards H87-G43]]<br /><br />Total power at idle for the ENTIRE SYSTEM is about 30 watts. That includes 4 fans, a PCI network card, a Velociraptor, and an SSD drive. Pretty good for all that if you ask me. Under full CPU load it gets over 100 watts though, but most of the time my server is twiddling its thumbs because the CPU is so fast and the server isn't that busy.<br /><br />If you already have a previous generation processor (like 2nd gen Sandy Bridge or 3rd gen Ivy Bridge), then it may not be worth the upgrade, but I'm not judging this chip on its worthiness as an upgrade but as a standalone CPU.<br /><br />The CPU cooler it comes with is decent, but if you're going to overclock then you may want to buy a 3rd party CPU cooler.<br /><br />Overall 5 stars.",2,False

5,Another great Intel processor,"I'm a software developer and typically enjoy building my own systems. My previous system was an overclocked i7-920.<br /><br />This processor is FAST... though I wish Intel had more competition!<br /><br />This is a very good processor with PCI Express 3.0 support. The matching Z77 chipset also adds features that I didn't have on my previous i7-920 machine, like USB 3.0 and SATA 6Gbps. Most of the Z77 motherboards support up to 32GB of RAM, but, for unknown reasons, I had instability with 32GB of RAM and am now using 16GB and 4x4GB sticks instead of 4x8GB sticks.<br /><br />I easily overclocked this processor (all 4 cores) to 4.4 Ghz using only a +.05 voltage offset in the BIOS on my Asus Z77 Sabertooth motherboard and found it stable with IntelBurnTest and Prime95. I'm sure I could have gone for more, but I like an energy-efficient, conservative overclock. A ""free"" 900 Mhz increase isn't bad and at this voltage with a Cooler Master 212 EVO cooler, the CPU temperatures are well under control. This scores a 7.8 in the Windows 7 Processor performance score (the highest is 7.9 which is hard to obtain unless you have a 6 core+ processor).<br /><br />I always use a 3rd party cooling solution, though I'm sure the provided fan and heatsink is sufficient when not overclocking. The reason I like 3rd party solutions is for greater cooling power (useful when overclocking) and for quieter operation, so consider a better cooler if you want to overclock or want something that might be a little quieter.<br /><br />The non-""K"" version has some additional features, but for 99%+ of people who overclock, I doubt giving up the unlocked multiplier (the ""K"") is worth it.",6,True
5,Top notch drive from Intel,"I bought this drive when it had a good rebate on it. It's nice to see SSD prices come down so much while performance & capacity has gone up.<br /><br />I upgraded from an Intel 160GB G2 SSD drive. My current workhorse computer doesn't support SATA 6 Gbps (yet) but I upgraded for other reasons besides performance (for dual booting actually). Having an Intel G2 SSD already and not having SATA 6 Gbps doesn't result in an obvious speed increase with the 330 series over the G2 for ""normal"" computer usage, but I suspect it's a bit faster even though it's not obvious.<br /><br />As for moving the data over, a restore with Windows Home Server failed because it couldn't find my home server for some reason, so I tried the Intel SSD Data Migration Tool and it worked well. I don't know why it seemed to copy the partition twice though... maybe the second time it was verifying even though it said it was copying. No matter, it worked!<br /><br />So I give an A for the Intel SSD Data Migration Tool and an A+ for the Intel SSD Toolbox Tool. These are good reasons to buy Intel, on top of Intel's name, reliability, and of course the rebate as an added bonus.<br /><br />And performance is quite good! Close to top notch (but not at THE top) for today's SSDs and MUCH faster than any mechanical drive... so A+ for performance.<br /><br />Some people don't like that this has a Sandforce controller, which has had issues in the past, but Intel seems to have gotten it right and fixed the problems by using their own firmware. In fact, most or all current Sandforce drives now should not have the problems of the past.<br /><br />If I have any problems then I'll update this review.<br /><br />UPDATE 2012-08-10: I've updated my development machine and it now supports SATA 6 Gbps. This drive is still working great and is even faster with a 6 Gbps connection. No problems at all.",0,True
4,SANDISK Cache using Intel Rapid Store Technology,"I bought the SanDisk Cache in an attempt to give my four year old MSI GX633 gaming laptop a little boost.

I downloaded the driver and the installation was painless. After a week I am beginning to see reduced boot time and quicker internet browser operation but the jury is still out concerning its value.<br />March 3, 2013: The MSI gaming laptop where the SANDISK Cache was installed has gone to my daughter. I purchased a new HP DV6-7014. Unlike the DV7-7000 I bought last summer, this one did not come with the optional 32 GB cache. In the DV6 I removed the optical drive and installed it in an external enclosure where it works nicely, even the BLURAY function. I installed the SANDISK Cache still mounted in its caddy into the DV6 optical slot. I then used the INTEL Rapid Store Technology software that comes with all recent Intel CPU systems. It likes the SANDISK and seems to be working very nicely. The only issue I have found with these caches is probable trouble during Windows installations.

5,Way cooler and quieter than Intel stock heatsink/fan!,"This big, quiet-running heatsink/fan arrived in good condition one day earlier than expected from the seller Platinum Micro, Inc. It's easy to install; study the diagram carefully or watch a video on YouTube.com. To install the black rectangular frame for an Intel cpu make sure to insert the outer and inner pushpins with rounded edges facing towards the center of the frame (as shown in the diagram!).<br /><br />Install this cooler for an Intel cpu with the fan blowing towards the rear of the case where the exhaust fan is. (Maybe you can install it facing towards the top of the case, but I didn't explore that.)<br /><br />Intel's stock cooler is reasonably quiet when idling (and it has a blue light!). However, when my Core i7-965EE quad-core processor is working hard (playing a game or transcoding video) the Intel cooler becomes really noisy, whereas the Arctic Cool Freezer 13 Pro remains fairly quiet. The difference is very noticeable!<br /><br />Checked cpu temperatures before and after running Prime95 tests which continually stress the processor to 100%.  Ambient room temperature was approximately 20 C.<br />IDLE: Intel-39 C. / Arctic-32 C.  UNDER LOAD: Intel-85 C. / Arctic-69 C.<br /><br />My motherboard software also monitors ""System"" temp. of components clustered around the cpu. When at IDLE the System temp. was about the same for both coolers but the Arctic kept it a good -5 C. cooler under 100% LOAD. Not bad!<br /><br />To sum up the Arctic Cool Freezer 13 Pro:<br /><br />1. It will make your cpu run 6 or 8 degrees C. cooler than the stock Intel or AMD heatsink/fan that came with your cpu (processor). The temperature difference will be even greater when the processor is working hard.<br /><br />2. It will be MUCH quieter when your cpu is working hard!<br /><br />3. It comes with effective, high quality thermal paste already applied. So, no extra cost to you for after-market thermal compound and no need to mess with applying it.<br /><br />4. It does NOT require you to remove the motherboard and fit a backplate in order to secure it. Simple installation is good!<br /><br />5. If your motherboard has other components (northbridge chipset, voltage regulators, etc.) clustered around the cpu location, the small fan at the base of the Freezer 13 Pro will provide extra cooling for those components, especially important for continuous running and for overclocking.<br /><br />6. The dual ball bearing design of the fan is proven and reliable for very long life and constant running.<br /><br />7. Other coolers which rival the Freezer 13 Pro on cooling ability do NOT have most of these advantages, thus making the Freezer 13 Pro a desirable choice for all but the most dedicated tinkerers.<br /><br />8. If you are overclocking a Core i7 cpu then you should seriously consider either a water-cooling kit with a large radiator (not 120mmx120mm) or a really expensive air cooler with more heat pipes and much more fan noise than this Arctic Cooling model.<br /><br />9.

Main base of charger can get extremely hot. Don't remember seeing anything or not in the manual but the base gets very hot when in use to the point it could burn your skin or possible melt flimsy material. This is NOT a health hazard or a major issue, just be careful.<br />2. While there has been no issues, the connection between the cable that going into an outlet and the base of the charge can see kind of loose. If I take the power cord and move it back and forth I can feel it is not 100% completely secured in there. It has never fallen off or stopped charged, guess just kind of nitpicking here.<br /><br />If you need a new charger for your Surface Pro, I absolutely recommend this cable, especially over Microsoft's version. It is nearly identical for a significantly cheaper price. Oh and my original Microsoft cord broken after a few years, so that extra quality you pay for might not be worth it.",2,True
4,Great purchase but the 350 would have been a more fiscally intelligent purchase,"My first foray into GPS navigation.  It is amazing the amount of capability that is packed into a small package.  I was not expecting to actually use the Bluetooth but I do, the only problem is my wife complains about echo when she is on the other end of the call.  Navigating your phone book and placing the call is best done from your handset itself.<br /><br />As good as it is it's not without problems.  The databases are not perfect, telling me to exit the highway to the left where no exit exists, and the business finder is about 2 years old.  Also many of the advanced features either require additional purchases or subscriptions.  These can be expensive.  Somehow I haven't quite figured out how to resume navigation if I get out of the map.  It offers you the option to Stop or Detour, but not Resume.  What am I missing???? (Duhh, I have since figured this out,not difficult but not necessarily intuitive either)<br /><br />Finally I would recommend that anyone who has doubts about the usefulness of the added features(European Database,Bluetooth) jump down to the 350 or  360. The 350 in particular packs a lot for the money and is likely enough for most people.  The Bluetooth(360&370)function does have issues with audio quality in my opinion and is more of a novelty for me at the moment. The European Database(standard on the 370)is of course useful only if you plan on traveling there, and can be added separately to the lesser models at a later date if you change your mind.<br /><br />So the 370 is great but the 350 is probably the route I should have taken, no pun intended.<br /><br />Update:  I have had the unit now for over six months and I still like it although I have learned not to trust it completely.  You should still use some common sense when going somewhere.  It seems to struggle in New Jersey, but I guess everyone does.  Also it has started to get slow when starting up, spending an unusually long time searching for satellites.",4,True

4,Good WiFi 6 adapter for Intel-based PCs,"Having recently upgraded my router to a WiFi 6 model, I was glad to find this FebSmart WiFi adapter to bring my desktop up to date. Like most current WiFi 6 adapters, this one is based on Intel's AX200 which is an excellent WiFi chip.<br /><br />Installation of the adapter was a very straightforward matter of inserting the adapter into an open PCIe slot, connecting the Bluetooth cable to an open USB header on my motherboard, and booting back up. Windows 10 automatically installed a driver, but I downloaded the latest version from Intel to be up to date.<br /><br />Performance wise, this adapter does fairly well, showing typical link rates of 1.3-1.4 Gbps. This is a little lower than the 1.7 Gbps I've seen on another WiFi 6 equipped PC in the same room, and likely explained by the slightly shorter antennas that are included with the FebSmart adapter. The WiFi signal has to get around the PC's metal casing and the mass of cables hooked up the rear of the PC, so every bit of antenna height matters. Regardless, the link on the FebSmart adapter is more than enough to handle every bit of my Internet connection speed.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this FebSmart adapter with a solid 4 stars. It provides excellent WiFi 6 and Bluetooth connectivity at a reasonable price. The antennas are a touch shorter than what some other companies offer, and that seems to slightly limit the typical link rate on this adapter. Antenna length aside, the adapter provides stable and reliable WiFi 6 and Bluetooth 5 connections.",0,False

5,"Well made, fits well, and intelligently designed","[[VIDEOID:30ec18bb53960bb5c629fedec36b63e3]] I typically do not purchase items from Amazon that have no reviews, but this product seemed to be more what I was looking for compared to other options so I bought it.  I've benefited many times from others' reviews, so I also decided I needed to be the first to review this product.<br /><br />I just received this, and overall it is well made, fits well, and it intelligently designed.<br /><br />Well made:  I've seen reviews of similar products where people have described them as flimsy.  The same might be said of this one, but I would the ""flaps"" of these shields have to be made thin in order to work right and close up.  Provided that you are not rough with it or try to open or close it too quickly, I don't see any problem with the thickness or durability of any of the parts.<br /><br />Fits well:  I purchased this for a Nikon D850, and it fits like a glove.<br /><br />Intelligently designed:  One thing that was a nice surprise that is not obvious in the product page pictures is there are TWO parts to the shield.  The first part is like an empty picture frame that clips to the D850's LCD.  The second part is the screen that attaches to the first part - by sliding from left to right and clicking into place.  This gives you the option to only use it when it is bright and sunny, and to view your LCD without having to open the screens.  I also like it because at times I do a focus check by looking at the LCD screen using a Hoodman Loupe.<br /><br />How well does it shade the LCD:  Last, I specifically bought this to more easily use LiveView outdoors for perfect eye-focus accuracy - when shooting shallow depth of field portraits (50mm or longer and F/2.8 or wider).  We haven't had any really bright sunny days here lately, so I am anxious to see just how much this will help me see the LiveView screen under those lighting conditions.",1,True

Some games refuse to start altogether, I'm not sure if it's the 1Gb memory or some other limitation, nothing really tells me.

5,Intel i7 8700 (non k) Stock Cooler vs Hyper T2,"I recently built a new rig mostly for gaming  & decided to skip overclocking to save some money, opting for the i7 8700 (non k). I did not plan on buying an aftermarket cooler, however the 8700 was running too hot for comfort with the stock heat sink.<br /><br />These tests were taken with an ambient temperature of 23c (+/-1c) in an Antec 900 case and medium-low graphics settings.  These were my results, yours may vary depending upon your case & setup.<br /><br /> The i7 8700 peaked at 85C playing Battlefield 5 for 1.5hrs with the stock cooler & stock paste. This is technically safe, but BLAH. Temperatures while playing mostly stayed in the 60s & low 70s. Idle temps with the stock cooler would bounce between 29-32c.<br /><br />With the Hyper T2 and a 10 year old tube of Arctic Silver 5, the temperatures peaked at 70c after playing BF5 for 1hr.  Temperatures while playing mostly stayed in the high 40s to low 60s. Idle temps with the Hyper T2 bounce between 25-30c.<br /><br />The noise level of the included fan is quieter than my case fans until it reaches about 60% speed. When web browsing I can't even hear it. When gaming its pretty noisy, but I don't care. Most of the time when gaming I'm wearing headphones, & the rest of the time the speakers & sub-woofer are blasting & shaking the walls.<br /><br />This cooler is sufficient for my purposes. It's also probably good if you need something compact. If you are overclocking & have the room, invest in a larger cooler.<br /><br />Also as others have said, installing the pins was somewhat tedious, one of them ended up bending & almost breaking. I had to make 3+ attempts to get them all to pop into place. Remove the fan from the heat sink first & put it back on after the sink is installed on the board.

It's sized to fit most 15.4"" laptops or smaller sizes along with the expected accessories, and does its job well, even in inclement weather (as I have already found). Measuring about 10¼"" wide x 14½"" long and 1¾"" thick inside, it's lightweight at about 1¼ pounds. It travels well and fits almost anywhere.<br /><br />The bag is thin and lightweight, and the main compartment is properly padded, though not puffy like some. It has a discrete and professional appearance, providing true functional protection without a lot of excess bulk and clutter. The workmanship is exceptionally good, with metal clips and D-rings for the removable, cushioned shoulder strap. It has premium YKK RC Fuse zippers that move smoothly.<br /><br />Its interior is properly lined, and won't scratch your computer when you're taking it out of this bag. There's an expandable front pocket that opens wide enough for your computer accessories, and there's an organizer inside. You probably won't spill your contents as there are restrictive fabric panels that limit how far it can open. The stitching is tight and the workmanship is exceptional, putting it simply.<br /><br />I regularly pack my notebook computer's external power supply in the expandable front pocket, along with a small USB hard drive, cables, pens, small notepads and such. It has a business card slot that keeps them handy, and there's a rear document pocket that holds magazines, files and papers when you're on the go. It's these kinds of details and design that one appreciates after you've bought the bag and discovered them.<br /><br />The top has a sturdy grab handle, and the strap is quite sturdy and comfortable, which is a failing with so many laptop bags and cases. The non-slip shoulder pad is excellent for hours of use. It's also worth noting that Think Tank offers an interesting lifetime guarantee that they call their ""No Rhetoric Warranty."" From personal I doubt that I'll never need to use it, but it's reassuring to know that this company is willing to stand behind their products this way.<br /><br />Be sure to measure your own computer before getting one of these. This laptop bag has interior dimensions in the main pocket of about 10¼"" wide x 14½"" long and 1¾"" thick, so if yours will fit, then this is a great choice. If not, there's the larger [[ASIN:B0085BIV34 Think Tank Artificial Intelligence 17 V3.0 Laptop Bag]]. But check your own computer so that you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />This bag has been quite useful with my 15"" PC notebook.

It is specifically designed to fit the 13"" Macbook Pro, along with any iPad, iPhone, power supply, AC cable, and more. Just check the specs.<br /><br />I've traveled with this [[ASIN:B0085BKZU6 Think Tank Artificial Intelligence 15 V3.0 Laptop Bag]] by car, train and subway. It's been exposed to snow and rain a few times, and though it doesn't have the rain cover that some of my other Think Tank camera bags have, my computer has remained dry and without moisture.

My [[ASIN:B005CWIVYI MacBook Pro]] fits quite easily, even with its additional hard shell case.

The strap's quick-release attachment hooks are metal, and attach to the loops quite easily.  They are very secure, yet here's the difference: because there are additional fastening loops, two on each side, you can carry this bag in either a vertical or horizontal fashion, and on either side.

The images taken with the intelligent auto setting are frequently really awful. You can get good pictures if you take the time to set things manually, but I buy a point and shoot camera primarily to use on automatic mode.  I found the colors to be dull, the images to be underexposed, the dynamic range to be dismal and, at the long end of the zoom range, the contrast to be terrible.  For such an expensive camera, this is really unacceptable. Judge for yourself from the attached images, all shot on auto mode. I am an experienced photographer, having shot 35 mm for decades and don't mind doing manual settings. However, there are many times that it simply takes too long and the shot is missed if it is all done manually, especially given the clunkiness of manual controls on a camera of this type.

New Dell XPS 8950 Desktop 12th Gen Intel i7 12700, DDR5, Windows 11.  Install was easy in the motherboard PCIe x4, checked Windows Update, Device Manager had no flags, BIOS updated prior. However, the 3.0 USB Sandisk and 3.0 4TB WD Elements devices ""did not show"" in File Explorer.  I found the ASMedia USB 3.1 eXtensible Host Controller – 1.10(Microsoft) under Universal Serial Bus Controllers in Device Manager and the light was on for the WD 4TB Elements - so it connected.  Come to find out Windows 11 did not recognize the attached devices until I went back to Device Manager and on the “second” line under File Action View Help are six icons – the “blue screen icon” on the far right is – “Scan For Hardware Changes” -- I clicked on that icon and all three plugged in devices started coming up in File Explorer and worked fine.  Now for the rest of the story --- I had ordered this card and returned it via UPS for not working -- even had my refund back.  Louis at Fanback Support sent me an email the next day -- see it below.  This person was beyond great -- he had a plan and stuck to it.  First the engineer ran some tests -- Louis then Air Expressed a tested new card from Hong Kong to Los Angles and USPS to Seattle.  Louis kept in touch via Amazon Email every step of the way.  I have to say the first card probably would have worked if I had know about the Device Manager -- Scan For Hardware Changes icon.  I have added cards on all my computer over the years and this is the first time they were not recognized at once in File Explorer – maybe it’s a Windows 11 thing or my bad luck.  I will say Louis at Fanback is one great guy at support.  This really was customer service above and beyond.

5,Intel Core i5 does it again...,"I have been building my own gaming pc's since 2011. In an effort to save a few $$, I opt to use the i5 vs the i7 and go for a higher end graphics card. While this may not be the optimal choice for most gamers, it has been a good working strategy for me.<br /><br />The gaming pc's I have built have been serviceable for as long as 5 years, with my last one retired utilizing an i5 3570K which my wife had been using when I upgraded my system in 2017 toan i5 7600K.<br />Both of these sysytems rocked gaming for me, never a problem, glitch, slowing of frame rates etc.<br /><br />When the 3570K system started having some motherboard issues, I rebuilt a pc for my wife integrating the bulk of my 2017 i5 7600k build into it. She has a blazing fast pc and is quite content with it.<br /><br />Filling the void, I built my current system with the Core i5 9600K, using a 1TB NVMe M.2 PCIe Gen3x4 ssd as the main drive and a Samsung 1TB evo ssd for secondary. This is the fastest pc I have ever owned, with remarkably fast boot up and loading speads. The M.2 ssd makes boot time from the appearance of the bios screen to Windows between 4.2 seconds  the fastest and 4.8 seconds being the slowest...remarkable.<br /><br />Gameplay is fantastic. I mostly play FPS & 3rd person shooters, and a few other type games like the Tomb Raider series.

It took a little bit of sleuthing to get it to work, though, because it still only did 4K/30 out of the box.  I had to use the Intel Graphics control panel to create a custom resolution of 4K at 60 Hz **AND ALSO** set the video timing to _CVT-RB_.

A support guide eventually tells you to call support. I'll tell you this now - don't bother. I don't know what headset they're using on their end, but the voices are barely intelligible. While you're on hold, you'll be told that you can find most help and answers on the ""World Wide Web"" - which is what sent you to the phone to begin with. Also, since the problem happened on more than one computer (that's a support step - really, so don't call unless you've tried on 2+ PCs, or you'll end up calling back later), then clearly the solution was to bounce me to Windows support. Since Windows support doesn't do hardware, clearly, the next logical step was.... patched through to ""Accounts & Billing"". I can't make this up! At least the person who answered me was helpful enough to point me to the Microsoft forums ([...]), where a support person pointed me to the product feature sheet to look for information on configuration.

5,Intel DQ67SW micro ATX motherboard,"I was building a new computer, and specifically chose this board for its virtualization support and built in VNC, which I haven't actually even used yet..<br /><br />For my use, I needed a few work arounds to get what *I* wanted, but all in all, it is serving me well, and is running great so far.<br /><br />The main ""issues"" with this board are:<br /><br />a)  If you use the Intel HD Graphics built into your CPU, you are limited to only 2 of the 3 video connections at one time..  The board has 2 DVI connectors, and 1 DisplayPort..  But you can only use 2 of them at any one time..  That's just how Intel HD Graphics works, no matter which motherboard you buy.  If you need more than 2 display devices at once, you need to buy a discrete graphics card from AMD(ATi) or nVidia.<br />b)  Straight up, you only have access to analog audio output or audio out over HDMI.  However, if you use the HDMI audio option, that uses one of your 2 displays..  The long story below is my learning experience with the audio-out on this board..<br /><br />For business purposes, this isn't a problem.  This is technically a business-oriented board.  For gaming or HTPC-type usage, it might be frustrating to you, if you want to have a minimalist system, but you also want the full suite of virtualization and Intel vPro capabilities, etc.<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />One quick note:  I recently updated the BIOS, and afterward my computer seemed to stop working..  I figured I messed up the BIOS update, and wound up putting back the older BIOS version, but my computer STILL didn't want to work..  Well, it was a dumb problem..  My boot drive was formatted with an EFI system partition (does Windows 7 force this?  I don't know..  I sure didn't remember doing this), and the BIOS defaults to not booting to such devices.  Once I figured that out, I reinstalled the newest BIOS version and set the BIOS correctly, and it is working fine again.  Just as an FYI here is what I needed to change: In the BIOS, under the BOOT menu, I needed to set ""UEFI Boot"" to ""enable"".<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Now, for my experiences with this motherboard..<br /><br />First off, I am running an i5-2400 processor on the board, in an Antec NSK-3480.  The board does not support the CPU overclocking available on the K series processors, and those processors also don't support the same virtualization capabilities of the non K i5's and i7's, so no need for it for me..  (and I don't care about overclocking the CPU..)<br /><br />I wanted to build an HTPC +  general-purpose computing computer, and figured this motherboard would work fine..<br /><br />There are no fancy CPU overclocking options on the board, as I mentioned above (and that's fine by me..), but you can overclock the graphics processor, and you can adjust the RAM voltage..  I have not messed with graphics overclocking, but I did *lower* the RAM voltage, and that worked fine.  You can't seem to change any other settings about the RAM..  At least not in the BIOS..  This board does support UEFI, which allows you to changes settings from within Windows..?  I think so..  And it supports memory profiles, so you might be able to change other aspects of the RAM through that, but I have no experience with this..<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Okay, this is the blah blah boring boring part, unless you are trying to get fancy-pants audio to your receiver and getting frustrated.  : D<br /><br />My main issue with this board (which was more of a learning experience..) was with its audio-out options..  I wanted this to be my HTPC, with my plan to have it connected to a projector and my receiver..  Normally this wouldn't be a problem.  Using the built in (into the processor) Intel HD Graphics, this board has 2 DVI connectors and 1 DisplayPort adapter.  The one limitation, though, is Intel HD Graphics only supports 2 devices at once..  so you can't use both DVI connections AND the displayport connection at the same time..  Normally, you would run the DisplayPort to HDMI and connect that to the receiver, and then the receiver to the projector with HDMI.  There's connection 1 and it takes care of getting audio to your receiver..  Then plug your monitor in for the second connection..<br /><br />However, there are a couple cases where this doesn't work:  your receiver doesn't have HDMI, or you have 2 displays and they don't have HDMI..  OR if you just want to separate the audio from the video..<br /><br />My case was a bit of both.  Before buying the board, my plan was to run the DVI connectors to projector and monitor, and the displayport->HDMI to my receiver..  Buttt, little did I know, HD Graphics only supports 2 devices at once, so I needed to disable the monitor when I am running the projector and sending audio over HDMI..  This caused me to ponder other audio options..<br /><br />On the back panel of this board, there are only 3 audio jacks..  And they are all analog audio jacks..  There are also headers on the board to plug in front audio jacks built into your case..  These are also analog jacks..  I, however, wanted to pass a DIGITAL signal from my computer to my receiver... which requires an S/PDIF connector (either coax or optical..).  This board has this connector, but it's just a header/connector on the motherboard, and not an actual coax or optical plug on the back panel..  Which required me to buy or build an S/PDIF adapter/dongle, essentially..  I happened to have some parts floating around, so I was able to solder an RCA plug to an S/PDIF cable that came with a cd-drive I got yeeears ago to make a coax connector..<br /><br />Well, that worked great!  I didn't have to buy anything extra, phew!  But annoying none the less..  And most of the other consumer boards just come with this connector right there on the back panel..  That's what I get for buying a business-oriented one..<br /><br />But then I realized this wasn't even what I wanted..  Coax and optical connections don't have the bandwidth to transmit the HD audio signals on Blu-ray discs..  It sends Dolby Digital and DTS from a dvd no problem, but Dolby TrueHD or DTS-HD?  Forget it..  You can only get that to a receiver 2 ways:  a) via HDMI audio or b) analog outputs from the computer to the analog inputs on a receiver.<br /><br />Back to the drawing board..  My problem is that I am actually running 2 projectors at the same time..  So I can't ""give up"", and just route the HDMI to the receiver to the projector..  I need two DVI signals to two projectors..<br /><br />That left me with a) getting a new graphics card (I didn't want to do this) which supports 3 video devices at once, or perhaps using the analog out from my computer to the 8 channel analog input on my receiver..  This motherboards has RealTek ALC888 audio, which supports 8 channel audio output..  Except this particular board isn't wired for it..  The 3 analog plugs on the back panel support only 6 channhel analog output.  The plugs on the front of the computer case cannot be ""repurposed"" to supply the last 2 channels..<br /><br />I didn't really want to use analog connections, anyway..  But that sent me looking for a new sound card with an HDMI-out, so I could just go back to using HDMI, and forget about it.  The cheapest card I could find was some 100$+ card that wasn't even available anymore..  Yikes..  Forget that!<br /><br />Then I thought maybe I could just drop in a cheap video card with HDMI and use that as my ""sound card""..  The only thing I was worried about was if I could use that card AND the Intel HD Graphics at the same time..  From what I had read, it sounded like it should work, but I didn't know for sure.  I picked up an MSI brand Radeon HD 4350 ""silent"" card with HDMI out.  The 4350 series of cards use the least power of all the modern graphics cards out there, and it's dirt cheap.  I didn't really care about its video performance since I planned to keep using the Intel HD Graphics for the dual projectors (which work great!), so no worries that it's two generations old.  After installing it, and  getting the right drivers for it (I needed to get a specific ATI HDMI audio driver from RealTek's website), all is working correctly!  Both video cards are running at the same time, the Intel HD Graphics doing the projectors, and the Radeon HD 4350 sending the 7.1 audio channel over HDMI.  Perfect.  It just took a while (and a new card..).",12,True

Amazon actually has the wrong photo for this non-J model--when it arrived, it had eight chips on each side.

5,What is admirable about this controller is the intelligent user interface making learning or teaching a breeze to ...,"I have used this for 2 years with no problem.  What is admirable about this controller is the intelligent user interface making learning or teaching a<br />breeze to perform.  I have probably brought over two dozens 'learn&#34; controllers over the years, and nearly all of them require key sequencing that is awkward at best, and totally frustrating at worst.  Typically, these tedious interface requires waiting for a LED feedback, such as X number of flashes,  Then you execute the next step and wait again for LED feedback.  Finally, you may have to actuate the Learn key again to accept all the changes.  Re-programming a key often depends on erasing the key in a separate operation, yet there is no confirmation that the key(s) has been successfully erased.  You work &#34;in the blind&#34; hoping the keys  has been erased as you laboriously programmed dozens of keys.  If not,  you start all over again...and again.<br /><br />With this sensible design, you simply press the learn key and the desired key together and it will program the key by automatically deleting the<br />existing command.

2,It works better than intel's cooler,"[[VIDEOID:6e4d9a71241044f2e2f39d9f3717405b]] What you need to know is that I am using a i7 3700 processor.  And it had a 59C average temp.  I am starting a rebuild and wanted to stay away from Liquid coolers because liquid and electronics do not mix.  Granted it can but not without risk.  So in preparation to my rebuild which I am doing slowly, I bought this as the thing which I will use with my i9-9900k.  The average temperature dropped to 39C using this fan cooler.

After removing the rubber top piece off the SSD I was able to get the drive into the bay. It did not slide in and out very well. I installed the way into my computer hooked up the wires and booted my machine up define that the drive was not being detected. .  I would return this item but it's too late now so I guess I'm stuck with a product that I cannot use very dissatisfied displays typical of all the products we get from over there.<br /><br />revision:  I purchased 2 new SMALLER thinner ssd drives.  I managed to get them installed after listening to screws on the back of the drive bay. I hope the device up to another computer, and still no drivers detected. This must be a defective back plane.

I am revise my reading at a later date if I can get this thing to work.<br />UPDATE. 12.7.19. I PUT IN FOR PRODUCT SUPPORT and spoke with an Amazon rep yesterday.

Know how to open your PC. You need to be careful. The wire caps are very small. It took me 20 minutes with a new HP Desktop TP01-1030.<br />Download the Intel WiFi 6 driver and the Bluetooth 5 driver from the Intel Website and make sure the two drivers are on your desktop and ready to install after you put your PC back together. It won’t work until they are installed. Speed is everything. I’m blazing downloads of over 400MB per second. Never had that before. Totally worth the small price. If you don’t feel comfortable installing, take it to the geek squad or a PC repair shop and they will guarantee their work. It will take them no more than 10 minutes.<br /><br />For those that want to install just the card in a laptop. If you have a miniPCIe it will have different size mini coax. The coax for this is called IPEX MHF4. Its super tiny. If you have the miniPCIe you have IPEX MHF1 which will not work. Don't do what I did and try to cut and splice the new size, impossible. Just buy an adapter to fit into the miniPCIe to put the M.2 Intel WIFI into and buy a wire internal antenna and run in around the inside of your laptop. Stick the arrays where there is no heat or fan movement and won't be disturbed if you open the back again. It doesn't have to be all around or symmetrical. Not expensive and you can get everything you need on Amazon.

2,Expert Builder Review: Avoid this SSD for Intel Baytrail NUC or Bay Trail boards..,"I am 20 years in the business of building computers. The reason for this review is protect all buyers. --- Over the past two years, I considered Sandisk a good low cost alternative to higher end SSDs. About 5 months ago, I bought 10 Sandisk Extreme II drives. That drive is 120 GB, has high read and writes in the 500 mbps range and high IOPS.  My last drive of that lot had problems with boot errors, proven by testing on different motherboards. In short, the drive would 'brick' for no apparent reason. So, I called SanDisk direct -- but got the BIGGEST hassle for replacement. The manager argued with me that he could only replace the drive after I sent this one first for evaluation -- in spite of my claim of 20 years of experience as a pc tech. Mind you, most OEMs trust such experienced techs; they advance the replacement or cross ship. I hung up the phone and then sent a nasty letter. They called back.. and agreed to replace the drive.. but wanted to send a new 'unproven' model with 2/3 the performance of the model I originally bought. This replacement is considered a low end model. -- When I finally got the drive, I got all kinds of problems when paired with Intel's newer chipset boards, including the Zotac ZBox SoC barebones models and ECS SoC boards (I-Bat) The drive would work fine for a week, then fail with black screen READ ERROR messages. And this occurred almost two weeks after I had successfully loaded Windows 7 Pro.. and done all the upgrades and just let the system set for a few weeks. ---- The fact is that SanDisk is playing bait and switch with crappy controllers. They are trying to compete with big names and started produced inferior product.  I am writing this review because of the nonsense I went through, the cheapness of the company for NOT replacing  high performance drive with one that probably would have worked great in the new cutting edge low power motherboards I now sell for TV Box systems.<br /><br />Update 10-14-15<br /><br />I recently started experiencing SSD drives 'bricking' when installing Win 7 and modifying the software. This first happened on the previous SanDisk and I blamed Sandisk. In their defense, this may have been a vulnerability of the SSD controller PAIRED with the Bios of the motherboards. And I finally saw a pattern...<br /><br />In the NUC and ECS Bat-I there is a bios setting called OPRom<br /><br />I first had to set this to Win 7 Boot and OPRom enabled.. in order for me to use Parted Magic to reset the controller (and unbrick the drive) Without this valuable utility, I'd have been toast.<br /><br />And finally figured out that loading Win 7 this way CAN prevent the bricking of the drive. In my case, it solved this issue on a Kingston Fury and an ECS Bat-I board (j1800 chipset)<br /><br />Regardless, SanDisk techs were clueless about these facts, whereby they should be the geniuses who know what to do when dealing with NUC or j1800 or j1900 chipsets.<br /><br />SanDisk is coming out with a new kind of memory for SSDs that is 1000 times faster. I have hopes SanDisk will redeem themselves in the performance arena. They just need better techs at the USA support office.",20,False

4,Computer Dead on Arrival but replaced overnight by Techno Intelligence,"Computer Dead on Arrival. I purchased the computer and paid for overnight delivery. It would not boot up....the Dell logo appears. It flashes a safe mode screen and then you see for a split second the windows logo and then nothing. After an online chat with Dell's infamous customer service department it was agreed that I should receive a new computer. I was told it would be 7-10 days for the delivery ( so much for my overnight delivery fee). According to the email I just received from Dell, it appears that I am not receiving the same computer that I paid for.....mine was to have 32 GB RAM. According to the email, the one that is to be shipped and 'possibly' arriving in a week or so has 16 GB Ram. Let's just say, I'm not happy and I am regretting my decision to purchase a Dell computer. I've emailed the customer service department twice with no response. Again, let me say, I am not happy with my decision to purchase a Dell computer.<br /><br />Update: I had to go through hoops and hoops to get the computer replaced. In the end...whoever I spoke with at Dell should be replaced. End of story.He refused to believe that I had purchased a 32 GB model even though I clearly had the purchase order from Amazon and the Dell Rep was only offering to replace the defective computer with a 16 GB RAM model. Amazon was aces and so was Techno Intelligence, the company who shipped the computer. Techno Intelligence offered next day delivery and a sincere apology. I am inclined to believe it was a manufacturers defect (that's you Dell). In the end, I received emails from Dell the next day after speaking with the Dell Representative and they were going to replace the computer with the  correct 32GB RAM although it would have taken a week. Techno Intelligence gave me overnight delivery and all is well. The computer is lightning fast and easy to set up once the replacement model arrived....no problems at this point. My only regret was contacting Dell at the beginning. I should have started with Amazon and went from there. Lesson learned.",6,True

After 2 years the brake lights stop working and the dealer buys back the vehicle because they are too cheap to purchase the replacement parts and too ignorant to recognize their faults.

4,Great Case for Intel DG45 Motherboards for HTPC,"Good price.  Lots of room for Intel DG45FC Motherboard and plenty of space for cabling and space for large custom CPU fan/heatsink.  My 5.25"" DVD drive fit perfectly in the external drive bay.  This case has great cooling with front case fan.  It draws air from the front and the air blows across the motherboard and exits from holes next to the CPU.  My only complaint is the front case 80mm fan runs at full speed (2 Wire) and is noisy.  I ordered a 3 wire variable speed fan and let the motherboard manage the fan speed.  The case is now almost silent.  The best feature of this case is there is LOTS of room.  Watch out for other mini itx cases that are smaller that cram everything together and impedes air circulation and are difficult to cable because of lack of room.  The DG45FC motherboard runs HOT and requires a lot of cooling.  I would have given this case 5 stars if they included a variable speed case fan.",3,False

Reading further about EMI and RFI piqued my interest even more. I recently had a problem with EMI through my desktop PC. After consulting with some PC geeks and learning some of the IT language. I did some personal research. This well insulated, nicely crafted cable should perform better than the average HDMI. How true that is! I was not disappointed! Both the sound and the picture quality had noticeably improved! And I just thought that was how it was supposed to be. I need to mention that my newer 8K Ultra HD HDMI stands in comparison with outstanding picture and sound quality.

And the integrated graphics is HD 505<br /><br />If you’re in the US, be sure to take the time to review the settings during Windows setup.  I have installed Windows enough times that I don't pay much attention to the setup screens - however, in this case the install was defaulting to the UK for everything, so you’ll want to change these.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the CPU is the main bottleneck.  This is a J4205 1.5GHz, burst to 2.6GHz.  It’s low power consumption.<br />I found that the CPU was pretty much constantly hitting 100% if I did anything.  The 12 gig of ram helps a lot, but it simply doesn’t take much to overwhelm the box.  Don’t expect to be playing games on it.  After you walk through the initial windows install menus, it’s best to take a break while it indexes and updates - the CPU stayed pegged at 100% during this time and caused the system to lag.<br /><br />I installed a spare SSD in it to expand its drive space.  See the video of installation - it was pretty simple to do and was available as expected in Windows upon boot up.<br /><br />All in all, if you know what you are getting, it fits the niche it’s for.  I wanted a small form factor PC that I could easily move between my hobby room and workshop.  My goal is to have avail where I’m working to watch ‘how to’ videos.

5,"Good battery. Bad Intel! Use Linux, not Windows.","This is an updated review.<br /><br />So, the battery turned out to be good and it's a 7 or 8 hour battery on Linux on my Yoga 900 ISK2, but it turned out that Intel recently had yet another security problem like all of those Meltdown and Spectre bugs that hit Windows and the Mac (I turned off the workarounds using a Linux command line override to get my performance back.), only this time they've disabled power management on the Intel graphics on Skylake chips and newer. Well, on the Yoga, that's a problem because the whole thing is a system on a chip and if one thing can't power down, the entire package stays awake and your laptop guzzles down 14 watts when it should only be using 8. Thanks Intel!<br /><br />Until Intel lands the ""soft RC6"" power state patch in Linux 5.5, I've reverted back to Linux 5.3.10 on Fedora 31 and set my dnf.conf to exclude new kernels until one gets a fix that doesn't ruin power management. I also added another command to my Linux command line to enable panel self refresh, which apparently does work now and Intel never turned it on.<br /><br />On top of that, I run powertop as a service to toggle maximum power savings<br /><br />So, the battery was not a problem and even the original 3 year old one should have probably been getting 5 hours instead of 3, but Intel ruined the power management on their hardware and panicked me. Anyway, my guess is that something like this is happening on Windows and Mac too, but there's nothing you can do except use Linux like I do and configure it properly. Buy AMD next time.<br /><br />The battery itself may need to be fully charged and discharged a time or two to get past jumping from 17% to 5% or weird stuff. After that, this battery seems to be calibrated.<br /><br />Other than that, my system clock lost power during the swap and had to be reset. No big deal.<br /><br />The battery works on the Yoga 900 ISK2, which is not stated in the product description.<br /><br />The ISK2 is a mid year refresh of the 900 which upgraded the Yoga 900 quietly to a stronger graphics chip and a faster solid state drive.<br /><br />The iFixIt instructions picture the wrong battery for the 900 and ISK2. They need the L14L4P24 like this one.<br /><br />Replacing the battery was pretty easy. Stores kept quoting me like $120, but I did it myself for $48 between the battery and a precision screwdriver kit.<br /><br />With the Fedora Linux system (With ideal power settings and processor bug workarounds off.), my Yoga 900 ISK2 is 50% faster than it would be under Windows 10 overall and should be useable for many years to come.",1,True

5,The Intel NUC 12 Pro is a niche desktop for a niche audience,"[[VIDEOID:efe04720b2c0a1584be034f542c0dd90]] Want a small desktop PC? You’ll struggle to find one smaller than Intel’s NUC 12 Pro . This diminutive computer is smaller than a paperback fantasy novel yet packs the performance to handle video editing, coding, or a few dozen out-of-control browser tabs. Miniaturization doesn’t come cheap, though, making the NUC 12 Pro a tough sell for budget buyers.<br /><br />Here are the specs of the desktop we tested:<br />* Processor: Intel Core i7-1260P<br />* Graphics: Intel Iris Xe<br />* RAM: 16GB DDR4<br />* Storage: 512GB NVMe PCIe M.2 SSD<br />* Wireless connectivity: 3x USB 3.2 Type-A, 2x Thunderbolt 4 with DisplayPort Alternate Mode, 2x HDMI 2.0, 1x 3.5mm audio jack, 1x Ethernet<br />* Wired connectivity: Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2<br />* Weight: 2.2 pounds<br />* Size: 4.6 x 4.4 x 1.5 inches<br /><br />The Intel NUC 12 Pro’s internals are based on Intel’s laptop hardware. It offers Intel’s mobile Core P-Series processors and uses compact DDR4 memory. Despite this, its connectivity and storage support is robust for its compact size and similar to most budget tower desktops.<br /><br />Desktop computers don’t get much smaller than the Intel NUC 12 Pro. It measures about 4.5 inches wide and deep, and only 1.5 inches thick. This is much smaller than most small desktop computers. Apple’s Mac Mini, by comparison, is nearly three inches larger in width and depth. (They’re about equal in thickness). A desktop this small is a niche. Most people simply don’t need a system this compact. When size matters, however, the NUC 12 Pro can’t be beat.<br />The NUC 12 Pro’s dimensions make it easy to place on, under, or inside a desk. The full NUC 12 Pro retail package (which is the model I tested) comes with a VESA mount for attachment to displays, display stands, and other accessories that support VESA mounting. This is most useful for business customers looking to permanently place the NUC 12 Pro out of sight but may come in handy for a super-sleek home office setup.<br />Its size and external power supply make the NUC 12 Pro portable. It’s not a laptop replacement, of course; a monitor, keyboard, and mouse are required. However, the NUC 12 Pro could be a good choice if you’re frequently away from home and want the comfort of a desktop in your hotel or rental. A NUC 12 Pro with a keyboard, mouse, and portable monitor can easily fit in luggage.<br /><br />Good processor performance in a small package!<br /><br />Small computers often sacrifice performance, but the Intel NUC 12 Pro bucks that trend. It delivers results in line with premium portable laptops and can defeat some budget mid-tower desktops.<br />The NUC 12 Pro I tested had Intel’s Core i7-1260P processor, which is the most powerful available in the Intel NUC 12 Pro. It has four performance cores and eight efficient cores for a total of 12 cores and 16 processor threads.<br />Processor performance doesn’t disappoint. The Intel NUC 12 Pro achieved a Geekbench 5 single-core score of 1688 and a multi-core score of 9676. This places the NUC 12 Pro near, or above, the performance of premium laptops like the Dell XPS 13 Plus and Asus Zenbook S 13 OLED. The NUC 12 Pro also holds up well against a mid-range Dell XPS Desktop, which hit a single-core score of 1595 and a multi-core score of 10353.<br /><br />The NUC 12 Pro also did well in Cinebench R23, where it reached a multi-core score of 10545. This easily defeats the Dell XPS 13 Plus, which scored 7015 in its standard performance profile. The Dell XPS Desktop is much quicker with a score of 16554, but the NUC 12 Pro trades blows in other budget and mid-range desktops like the Acer Aspire TC-1760, which scored 10836.<br />Storage performance is also strong. The Intel NUC 12 Pro achieves an impressive storage read speed of 4866 megabytes per second in CrystalDiskMark, easily beating other premium laptops tested this year. That’s good news if you often work with, open, or transfer large files.<br /><br />It’s packed with connectivity!<br /><br />Intel packs the NUC 12 Pro with a broad range of future-proof and practical connectivity options despite its small size. This includes three USB-A 3.2 ports, great for wired peripherals like keyboards, mice, and webcams, alongside two Thunderbolt 4 / USB-C 4 ports.<br /><br />The Thunderbolt ports include DisplayPort Alternate Mode, meaning both can work as video connections when connected to a monitor with a Thunderbolt or USB-C port. Alternatively, you can connect to other displays through a USB-C to DisplayPort or USB-C to HDMI adapter.<br />That may not be necessary, however, as the NUC 12 Pro also includes two HDMI 2.0 ports. A 3.5mm headphone jack, located up front, rounds out wired connection options.<br />Wireless connectivity includes the Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2 standards. Most people likely don’t own a Wi-Fi 6E router or Bluetooth 5.2 devices, as they’re relatively new. Still, it’s great to see these standards included as they prepare the desktop for future upgrades to your Wi-Fi network and wireless devices.<br /><br />Graphics performance is the Intel NUC 12 Pro’s big weakness and could be the deciding factor for many potential buyers. Every Intel NUC 12 Pro relies on Intel Iris Xe integrated graphics.<br />To be fair, the NUC 12 Pro performs well for a system relying on integrated graphics. It achieved a 3DMark Night Raid score of 17145. That beats the Dell XPS 13 Plus, which scored 14069. 3DMark Fire Strike turned in a score of 4440 which, once again, is a good result for the hardware. That’s much better than the Acer Aspire TC-1760, which only scored 1895.<br />Yet these results fall far short of desktops with an entry-level graphics card, and they’re not adequate to play modestly demanding games. The MMORPG Final Fantasy XIV: Endwalker, which is over a decade old, can dip below 30 frames per second (fps) at 1080p resolution and High detail settings. Shadow of the Tomb Raider performed like a slideshow at 1080p and Highest settings, averaging just 18 fps.<br />Those who want better graphics performance, whether for games or productivity, can plug in external graphics via one of the NUC 12 Pro’s Thunderbolt 4 ports. This should deliver good results if paired with a mid-range graphics card like the AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or Nvidia RTX 3060. Setting up a dock can be a hassle, though, and adds technical complexity when making a GPU selection. Many high-end graphics cards work poorly in this situation.<br /><br />Upgrades are possible, but not for everyone!<br /><br />The Intel NUC 12 Pro, like most NUC computers, is remarkably easy to repair and upgrade for its size. Just remove four screws at the base, pop off the plastic lid with a soft tool, and you’re inside. Components that aren’t soldered to the board can be replaced, like the RAM, storage, and wireless adapter.<br />Yet there’s no way around the NUC 12 Pro’s dimensions. It’s small and unconventional, which can make it intimidating for owners inexperienced with repairing computers. The components feel quite durable, so they should prove forgiving to minor mistakes, but owners have to know what they’re doing. The NUC’s size means some components that would fit in a typical tower desktop won’t fit here. One example? Many top-tier SSDs now ship with heatsinks that might not fit in the NUC 12 Pro.<br />Also, as mentioned, the processor can’t be upgraded. The same is true of the desktop’s integrated graphics (though you can add an external graphics dock). This will, in the long run, limit the desktop’s useful life.<br /><br />The Intel NUC 12 Pro is defined by size. It delivers excellent processor and storage performance—for its size. It packs amazing connectivity—for its size. And it’s surprisingly easy to open and repair—for its size. So, the question is this: do you want (or need) the smallest desktop computer possible?<br />If you do, the Intel NUC 12 Pro is king. It’s significantly smaller than Apple’s Mac Mini, yet has more connectivity options. It also compares well against Lenovo’s ThinkCentre M-Series, HP’s Z Mini, and Dell’s Precision Compact. Competitors are larger, a bit more expensive (for a given amount of RAM and storage), and have fewer ports.<br />If you don’t, the Intel NUC 12 Pro isn’t for you. Its processor performance is solid but nothing you can’t find in a less expensive tower PC. A tower PC can also offer a discrete graphics card, boosting graphics performance far beyond what the NUC 12 Pro can handle.<br />The Intel NUC 12 Pro is a niche desktop for a niche audience, and it fills that niche extremely well.",3,True

5,Great Upgrade for Stock Intel CPU Cooler,"After I determined the reason my HTPC kept shutting down was due to overheating because the cheap, poorly designed Intel CPU cooler (the kind with the stupid plastic push-and-twist mounts) had broken loose, I started looking for another CPU cooler that would both still fit in the cramped case and that would have better mounts.  The Dynatron K987 model appealed to me because it has basically the same form factor, but is overall much higher quality.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Metal mounting screws and springs with a backplate for solid and easy installation.<br />-Taller cooling fins.<br />-Copper core.<br />-Quiet fan.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-You will have to remove the motherboard to attach the backplate, at least for the 775 type socket install.

5,Great adapter that works well on my Intel Ultrabook,"My wife wanted to use the larger monitor on the desk instead of looking at the smaller 14"" Untrabook screen while working on assignments.  To accomplish this we needed to adapt the DVI cable from the monitor to the Intel Ultrabook mini HDMI.  Using a DVI to HDMI cable worked well connecting to the monitor, then with this adapter I down sized the HDMI connection to the Mini HDMI size that the Ultrabook has.  This adapter works well and now my wife can use the full size monitor and have less eye strain through the day.  To be clear, of all the options that include cable etc, we bought only the mini adapter that adapts from full HDMI to mini HDMI, since we already had HDMI cables.<br /><br />There are other ways to get video from the Ultrabook to the monitor (USB adapters) but this simple and clean solution is working well for us.  You do need to make sure that the mini adapter is fully seated in the Ultrabook, and then due to all of the pressure the longer and heavier cable is exerting we put the Ultrabook aside and don't bump it.  It stays connected fine that way.<br /><br />5 stars for a high quality low cost adapter that had worked well for us for months now.",1,True

4,"Limited by Intel’s display driver, but speedy for the size. Decent HTPC option.","### What I use it for ###<br /><br />I got this Beelink Mini PC to use as an HTPC (Home Theater PC). One might ask, “Why not use devices like FireTV and Roku?” My response to that is that I do, but there are times I want to use custom software not supported by them. Such as when playing video files. While Plex can be used for this to a degree, I much prefer using alternative software and playing the videos using MPC-HC, which has built-in codec good for MKV and other such files. I’ve been using a desktop for this but was attracted to the small size of the Beelink. Instead of a large tower sitting on my floor, the Beelink sits nicely on my entertainment center stand and takes up very little space.<br /><br />### Noise ###<br /><br />The Beelink runs extremely quiet, even when the hard drive is active. I metered the noise at an average of 19dB, which is listed as “breathing” on the level chart. And that’s with the meter right next to the vent. At a distance, you can’t hear the PC running at all.<br /><br />### Built-in WiFi ###<br /><br />The Built-in WiFi is decent, but not amazing. The good thing is that it works with both 2.4GHz and 5GHz. I point this out because many low-budget Built-in WiFi cards only work with 2.4GHz, so you are stuck with slower speeds. Thankfully the Beelink does both. At 2.4GHz I got an online download speed of 34Mbps. At 5GHz I got an online download speed of 89Mbps. For comparison, the Built-in WiFi on my iMac gave me a download speed of 206Mbps (5GHz). As you can see, that’s much faster than the Beelink, but 89Mbps isn’t bad. It’s plenty fast enough for streaming video. That said, on the Beelink, the signal strength of the 2.4GHz was much better with 4-bars whereas the 5GHz only has 1-bar and sometimes drops. That’s mostly due to the fact I have some distance between the PC and my WiFi router. 2.4GHz is more stable. 5GHz is faster.<br /><br />### Speed ###<br /><br />Considering it uses a Celeron processor, which is known to be slower, I found the Beelink to be zippy. Having the OS on an SSD with 8GB RAM helps. While 2400 MHz isn’t the fastest RAM, it works well with the setup. Programs open quickly and operate smoothly. While Celeron isn’t known to be a speedy processor, it is low power consumption and won’t use up a lot of electricity. Plus it helps to keep the Beelink running cool.<br /><br />### Bootup Time ###<br /><br />Boots extremely fast. Less than 20 seconds between power on, log on, and being fully loaded and ready to use. I’m amazed at how fast it loads, honestly.<br /><br />### Windows OS ###<br /><br />There are a few different things I want to address here:<br /><br />1) There’s no license attached to the copy of Windows installed on the Beelink. Under the bios it shows “Default string” as the SerialNumber. Under Windows it shows “Product key was not found.” Instead, Windows is activated with a digital license and is locked into parts of the hardware. I’m personally not a big fan of this because if for some reason you have a hardware failure and you need to replace a part, it could void Windows. It also makes reinstalling a pain should you need to reformat. I highly suggest that you link your Microsoft account with this PC so that the digital license links to your account, as that will make reactivation easier in some situations. Also, be sure to have System Restore configured so you can go back rather than having to reinstall.<br /><br />2) Thankfully it comes with Windows Pro. The advantage of Pro over Home edition is the ability to run a web/FTP server (iis) and to remote desktop in (RDP). I’m not sure how well the Beelink would work as a web server since it’s low power, but the RDP is really useful. It lets me connect to it from another computer so I can make changes without having to fully load my entertainment system. Although it is a bit laggy at times when running over RDP.<br /><br />3) It’s compatible with Windows 11. I ran the PC Health Check tool from Microsoft, and it said, “This PC meets Windows 11 requirements.” The update hasn’t been pushed out to the Beelink yet but looks like it’ll work with it.<br /><br />4) The Windows install is really clean. No Bloatware or other such nonsense. In fact, under installed programs, it only shows Microsoft Edge, OneDrive and Update Health Tools. OneDrive can be a resource hog, and I don’t use it, so I just uninstalled it. Alternatively, it can be deactivated under the startup items. Much easier and quicker than de-junking most retail PCs like HP and Dell.<br /><br />### Gaming ###<br /><br />It probably goes without saying, but this system is not for gaming. The specs are way too low for anything significant.<br /><br />### Bluetooth ###<br /><br />It has Bluetooth and I was able to connect a Bluetooth mouse without issues.<br /><br />### Video Display ###<br /><br />Now, here’s the biggest problem I had. The Video Display Adapter uses the Intel(R) UHD Graphics 600 drivers. That means Windows controls your display settings, which is really limited. I had all sorts of issues with this. My entertainment system uses a soundbar which then connects to an Epson projector. The Beelink would not work on this setup. It just showed a blank screen. And that’s with me hooking up a separate monitor to the second HDMI port to control the settings of the projector display. On top of not working through the soundbar, it would not work when directly connected to the projector using my 4K rated 25-foot Aurum Ultra Series - High Speed HDMI Cable, which retails for less than twenty bucks. It would only work when directly connected by my Yauhody Real 8K HDMI cable which retails for one hundred and fifty bucks (but that cable does not work with the soundbar). So, to monkey around I must manually unplug my Yauhody cable from my PS5, then plug it into the Beelink, and THEN use the audio jack on the PC to connect a 3.5mm audio cable to the soundbar to get sound. This is an annoying Mickey Mouse solution that I’m not happy about. I don’t know why it won’t work with my soundbar and 4K cable like my other devices do. For instance, my FireTV and PS4 connect through the soundbar just fine. So I’m stuck using the setup for my PS5 instead. Had there been third-party control over the drivers, such as AMD Catalyst Control Center, I have no doubts that I could have gotten it to work. But being stuck with Window's limited display options, I couldn’t. Trust me, I tried everything. All the “advanced” options and whatnot. Different resolutions. Different cords. Nothing worked. I was an IT Administrator at a former job for years, built my own computers from scratch, ran company servers, installed conference room TVs and projectors, fixed client desktops among other things. So I know my way around this stuff.<br /><br />### Conclusion ###<br /><br />Other than the video display issues, I do really like this mini PC. Granted, it can be a bit buggy at times. Sometimes it locks up when booting up and can crash, but once I got everything up and working initially it’s been loading better. And like I said, the boot time is extremely fast, so if you have to force restart (holding the power button for several seconds) it doesn't take long to come back up. I paired it with the Rii K25 Infrared Remote [ASIN: B06XHF7DNQ] and they work pretty well together.",3,False

5,"Great motherboard, tips for updating the BIOS to work with Intel 13th gen (13700k etc)","This is a great motherboard. It feels very sturdy, the PCIE slot for the GPU is extremely stable, and the motherboard runs nicely. Instructions below for how I updated BIOS easily for 13th gen Intel.<br /><br />My only complaint with this motherboard is that the front panel connectors, which are already hard enough to plug in, are extremely hard to find on the motherboard due to TINY out of place writing and also it didn't come with anything to make it easier to plug them in. That was a pain. Otherwise this motherboard has performed very well and the BIOS interface and MSI support page/website are great.<br /><br />If you're trying it with a 13th gen Intel CPU it won't work until you update the BIOS. The best way to do this to avoid errors is to do the BIOS update IMMEDIATELY, before installing CPU or anything, really. First, using another PC, format a USB 2.0 32 GB or smaller as FAT32 with a default allocation size. Download the correct, recent BIOS from MSI's site (currently it's 7D31v19). Extract the main BIOS file directly into the USB with NO FOLDERS (don't leave it in its folder) or any other files and rename it to MSI.ROM<br /><br />Now once you get the motherboard out of the box, connect it to the 16-pin power to your unplugged/powered off PSU, and also to the CPU power to the PSU (use the plug on the left, CPU 1 / ATX power 1). DO NOT CONNECT ANYTHING ELSE, NO RAM OR CPU OR ANYTHING, JUST THOSE 2 plugs TO THE PSU. Then plug the PSU into the wall, and power it on (do NOT power PC on with PC power button, just flip switch for PSU power). Hook your USB up to the Flash Bios USB slot in the Motherboard. Push the Flash BIOS button once. It will flash red for a few seconds, then main motherboard lights will come on, including the fancy dragon. The red light by BIOS button will keep flashing for about 3-8 minutes and then you will see the motherboard power off then on again and the Flash Bios button red light will stop blinking and go dark. Wait another 1-2 minutes and then you can unplug everything and assemble the Mobo into your PC. If the light doesn't blink red initially but instead just stays solid read after a few seconds when you first try this, you need to fix your USB formatting / BIOS file or use a different one. For me this happened when my BIOS file was in a folder instead of directly in the USB with no folders.",9,True

So I replaced it with an Invidia GTS 660 hoping that the problem would be solved (A $230 expense!)... only to discover that it HADN'T been solved. Same frequent BSOD. (sigh).

I took the chance and replaced the SDRAM with Kingston Technology HyperX 16 GB SDRAM - and sure enough, no blackouts. This cost me overall well over $300 to solve the problem NOT including the cost of the initial investment in graphic card and Corsair Ram. Is this my fault? I think not. It's well over 30 days - heck over a year - and it's way too late for recompense from Corsair. I'm posting this alert/warning to help others before they make the same mistake.

1,"👎 Intel NUCs and Iris Xe: 100% Hype, 0% Bark 👎 (Can't even play 15+ year old games! 🤦‍♂️)","Intel has been aggressively investing in newer graphics technologies, suggesting that their Iris Xe graphics are a revolution in integrated graphics technology. They aren't. AMD has had Radeon Vega integrated graphics for quite some time now (which are MUCH more powerful), and GPU-embedded CPUs are also a thing to give power to budget computers. While Iris Xe graphics are a major stepping stone for Intel looking to compete with AMD and nVidia, the heavily touted notion that they are gaming grade is sheer bogus and outright false marketing and product misrepresentation. All benchmarks suggest that they don't even compare to the lowest grades of graphics cards that are currently manufactured and sold, which includes cards that are several years and generations old (such as a GeForce GTX 1050, for example). Not even AMD is not so bold as to suggest that their superior (embedded) Vega graphics are gamer grade, so what is Intel thinking?<br /><br />🙄 Gaming Test Results: Pathetic 🙄<br />(For the tests, I'm using a single 1080p monitor.)<br /><br />My first test begins with a classic: Skyrim, a timeless classic beloved by gamers of all shapes and colors that is well over 10 years old by now (already!!?). Skyrim's hardware auto-detection configured graphics quality for ""Ultra Detail"", which was a complete and total surprise for me and set high expectations for me, but I was immediately disappointed by how laggy the game was moving the camera around, even slightly and gently. I exited out and changed the graphics quality to ""Low"", and the game remains stupid laggy. Skyrim is hardly a ""high end"" game anymore compared to newer titles even more demanding of computational performance, so I don't know how the product image dares tout that this PC could handle newer titles like The Witcher 3 - did the marketing department even bother trying to play the game on this paperweight, or are they making the claim that it is ""technically playable""???<br /><br />My second test was with a recent but still relatively low-spec game: Overwatch 2. Again, even at the lowest graphic settings, the lag is pretty bad moving the camera around, interacting with the environment, etc. Absolutely not playable.<br /><br />Finally, I tried a considerably older Triple-A title: Oblivion, released back in 2006. This game was very barely playable at medium settings. There were many times where I could see some lag and stutter. I honestly don't see how a $800+ computer released in 2022 could dare tout itself to be a ""gaming"" computer when it can't play triple-A games from 2011 or 2006 at low/medium settings.<br /><br />🤦‍♂️ Non-Gaming Performance: Overkill 🤦‍♂️<br />So, now that we've eliminated gaming from consideration (and, by extension, other uses that demand high graphics capability such as graphic design, video editing, etc), how does this computer perform in other endeavors? It suffices to say that the specs are generous and it performs nicely. Let's be honest: it's hard to conceive of a scenario in which you would experience poor performance with a fast processor, an NVMe drive, Wifi 6e, and 32GB of high-frequency RAM when you aren't leveraging graphics. The concern at that point, however, is who is going to utilize all those resources without a good graphics adapter? Seems a bit excessive for internet browsing, checking email, office productivity, listening to music, playing videos, and using social media even if there are multiple programs running on two 4k monitors. I mean I've run my gaming PC on 4 monitors and just 16GB RAM just fine, I don't see why grandma needs more RAM than I do to check her email or why a college student needs so much to work on a PowerPoint presentation. Doesn't many any sense to me.<br /><br />Considering that this is not intended to be a server, this computer is too disproportionately powerful and too expensive to be of practical value compared to other computers at lower price points and with more reasonable specifications.<br /><br />🤷‍♂️ Value vs Specs? Debatable 🤷‍♂️<br /><br />If we exclude from consideration false claims of ""this is gaming grade"", we have to ask ourselves: is this computer worth the price of its hardware specifications? That's a tough call as there is a lot of subjectivity involved. It is not difficult to put together a supremely more powerful computer - and a gaming capable one at that - with the same budget as this computer is priced, and there are also more powerful premades, too, from reputable brands at the same (or lower) price points available new for purchase. However, the reason why most people give this computer any consideration to begin with is because it is a mini PC. Mini PCs have the benefit being very, very small (which appeals to both practicality and vanity), and they tend to make little noise, generate little heat, and require relatively little electricity.<br /><br />For do-it-yourself computer builders, there are limits to how small of a PC can be built with commodity components, and these computers are bound to require more electricity and generate more heat (though unlikely noticeable or problematic for mini PCs). For devices that are even smaller and more power efficient, a premade with the 'benefit' of proprietary parts (motherboard, power supply, case, etc) is going to be required, and that is where PCs such as this one come into play.<br /><br />If we were to attempt to make our own computer using comparable parts, the break down looks something like this (at the time of writing):<br />- 2x16GB SO-DIMM DDR4 RAM: ~$100<br />- 12th Gen i5 Core CPU: $175~$350+<br />- 512GB NVMe M.2: ~$50<br />- Wifi 6e Card: $30~$50<br />- Win 11 Pro OEM: ~$30<br />- Case: ???<br />- Motherboard: ???<br />- Power Supply: ???<br />- Graphics Adapter: ??? (could be $0 if we opt for integrated graphics, which could be either worse or better than the Iris Xe)<br /><br />As you can see, there is a considerable amount of subjectivity here based on how important of a consideration the size of the computer is (in which case premade mini-PCs might be the only option) and how powerful you want them to be (in which case the cost is extremely variable).<br /><br />📝 Misc. Notes 📝<br />You can pop the lid off to install a 2.5"" SDD in an empty bay. You can also replace the M.2 NVMe or the 2x RAM sticks if you wanted to. This is fairly common with most premade mini-PCs.<br /><br />👎 Conclusion: If you MUST have a mini-PC, there are better alternatives 👎<br /><br />If you're a gamer, you're going to be disappointed, as this is NOT a gaming PC. Not even a little bit. Not even in its wildest fantasies. It's false advertising at its finest, and Intel should be ashamed of themselves for suggesting that it is.<br /><br />If you need less then there are alternatives that cost far less: I own two other Mini PCs of comparable size and port configurations that also offer dual 4k HDMI output, and they are equally well suited as this one for every day tasks and casual recreation (music and videos) as this one, but they cost 1/4th as much as this one. At ~$200, they also come with Windows 11 Pro/NVMe and run smoothly.<br /><br />If you need more performance: it is hard to conceive of a non-server scenario in which anyone would require so much processing power and RAM and not require graphics capability. It doesn't make any sense, and it's hard to justify the price if you can't justify the need. If you need that much power, you probably need the graphics capability, and if you need the graphics capability, you're probably better off getting a different type of computer. (And if you need a server, you're probably better off getting a server.) In short: if you need more, this isn't for you. And you can probably get more for less while you're at it.<br /><br />If you absolutely need a Mini PC and can't find one with an actual GPU (even with shared memory), see if you can find one with AMD Radeon Vega graphics instead of Intel Iris Xe as it is a very considerable upgrade (some Vega graphics chipsets are more than 3x as powerful as Iris Xe).<br /><br />Bottom line: At ~$800, this is stupid overpriced and the 'gaming grade' marketing is reprehensible. Would not recommend to anyone, period. 👎👎👎",1,False

3,Intel's Compute Stick is a better option for streaming,"I bought this as a gift to be used as a home theater PC.  I have built my own Windows- and OpenElec-based HTPCs.  In addition, I bought Intel's Compute Stick (also as a gift) and several set-top boxes (Roku, Amazon Fire TV, etc.). Thus, I have used other similar products before and by comparison, this Dell has the following real-world pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros:<br />This device has greater expandability than both set-top boxes and the Compute Stick - one can open the case and increase the amount of RAM or the size of the SSD.<br /><br />Connectivity - you have an ethernet port and several USB ports.<br /><br />Cons.<br />The bloatware is absurd.  It is difficult to imagine who would be using this device in a way that would benefit from installation of McAffee, Dropbox, etc.  This device is not a workstation so the productivity tools should be omitted.<br /><br />Slower than the Intel Compute Stick - by a lot.  This probably has a lot to do with the bloatware but it could also be related to its having a Celeron instead of a quad core Atom processor.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you are looking for the best device (out of the box) to stream video, there are probably better choices.  If you are streaming only Netflix, the Fire TV is tough to beat.  If you are using only Kodi and its addons, install OpenElec on a Compute Stick.  If you use both Netflix and Kodi, you will need Windows - and the Compute Stick still wins.<br /><br />This device could be made into a winner by (1) clean installing windows, (2) upgrading the RAM, and (3) increasing the size of the SSD.  These steps are probably too technical and costly for many potential customers.",2,True

To my knowledge, this one can only be used with AT&T unless you can actually get them to unlock it. Also, for those wondering, you can use it on a regular A&T plan as well as without a SIM card if you just want to use it like an MP3 player.",0,True

3,Best Intel CPU I ever owned,"Runs alot cooler than my the 6600 it replaced. Idles in upper 20C range and maxes out around 50C with all 4 cores at 100% load using stock heatsink and fan. Old 6600 idles in upper 40's and went all the way up to 60+ under full load. Intel needs to get rid of hard to install pushpin design for heatsink and fan. Very difficult to install correctly and you might bend/crack motherboard in process! So that's why I""m taking off a star mainly for that. Otherwise, a decent cpu all around but probably overkill for most users since most software today still isn't written for multiple cores so most of the time the extra cores go unused. Also some programs get confused by the extra cores. Didn't really help much compared to my old 6600 in Flight Simulator X main reason I upgraded. It really shines when doing video encoding,using photoshop or using any 3D programs like 3DMax or Maya though! If I had to do it again I probaby would've upgraded to a E8600 with it's faster clockspeed instead since I spend more time playing games than rendering. In conclusion highly overated IMO. Intel would like you to believe that megahertz and pure speed doesn't matter anymore but don't believe the hype! Having said all that it does make for a great Porn CPU!<br /><br />Update: It's been almost a year now that I've had this cpu and it still does all I ask of it and it runs Windows 7 RTM like a champ. No need or desire to upgrade to newer Intel cpu's that don't accomplish much more than what this aging cpu can already do. I'm still amazed sometimes at how snappy and quick windows pop up in Windows sometimes. It still feels like I bought(in my case built) my PC yesterday since it's so fast!<br />If I could change my rating I'd add a star for longevity and continuing to perform like it was a cpu just released yesterday.<br /><br />p.s.

Second, the 660p seems to perform faster than it's contemporaries, although we've not done any conclusive testing to verify.<br /><br />And the third attribute to note is the 660p utilizes Intel drivers that are not supported by other NVMes. This may be part of the performance optimization observed once installed, being it's more prevalent on motherboards with Intel chipsets supporting the MVMe M.2. We expect such gains on Intel's Optane models which are in the same class, but only supported by Intel Gen 8 processors and up.<br /><br />We're truly surprised that you don't see more Intel NVMe sticks in the wild.",0,True

4,Very solid...except for Intel HD (FIX INCLUDED IN THIS REVIEW!),"I purchased this due to a major payment mixup by Amazon on a purchase made of a GL551 which also was defective.  See that review here: https://www.amazon.com/review/R1WHIFFEY21CBH/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm .<br /><br />This laptop has been excellent so far.  I am writing this on Day 1 of owning it, so there will potentially be updates to come.  Enough about that, let's dive in!<br /><br />Externals:<br />The laptop is a very nice aircraft-gray brushed-aluminum look on the exterior.  It is nowhere near as bad a fingerprint magnet as its predecessor (GL551), but it is still quite the magnet on the inside/keyboard/trackpad area.  The plastic on the bottom has an engraved &#34;futuristic&#34; design, and offers easy access to user-serviceable internals (SSD slot, HDD, memory).  The keyboard offers the same backlighting as the GL551, with pronounced lighting on &#34;WSAD&#34; keys for gamers.  The chiclet keyboard has a very nice feel and is easy to type on.  As a lover of mechanical keyboards, the chiclets give a nice tactile feedback while not being too &#34;laptop-ish&#34; like a Macbook Pro or other laptop.  This has a similar feel to higher-end non-mechanical short-throw/wireless/portable Logitech keyboards.  It does include a full range of keys including the ever-elusive &#34;delete, prt sc, pause, home, pgup, pgdn&#34; keys that often are missing from laptops.  A full-featured numpad and function keys are included as well.<br /><br />Internals:<br />The specification list is somewhat iffy on Amazon's page.  This DOES NOT have a 1TB SSD.  It is a 1TB 7200 RPM mechanical HDD.  If you opt for the DH74 model, an M.2 SSD is also included.  This one does not have an SSD, but has the slot for a user to add an SSD if they so choose.<br /><br />With older models (I'm looking at you GL551), in order to achieve 16GB of RAM, you had to buy an extra module, this laptop comes with 16GB DDR4 clocked at 2133mhz.  As mentioned, it also has 1TB of HDD space, split into 2 partitions, OS and Storage.  After partitioning/file system/recovery, the OS partition has 371GB of space, the Storage partition has 558GB of space.  An optical drive is also included still (unlike many laptops now).  This is a DVDRW drive, supporting all CD/DVD media...it is NOT a bluray player/burner.<br /><br />Graphics:<br />This laptop sports a GTX960M (not the 4GB model, but the 2GB) which is more than fine to play most any game at high-ultra settings, including, but not limited to: Elite:Dangerous - Horizons, Fallout 4, Call of Duty Black Ops 2 & 3, Guild Wars 2, and others.<br /><br />Also included (thanks to the processor) is the Intel HD 530.  This particular little guy is what is causing me to give this laptop four stars, as it will be a tremendous pain for anyone purchasing a Skylake-based laptop on Windows 10 with default manufacturer drivers as it causes rapid crashes and recoveries, blue screens, and flickering/black screens.  The driver Asus includes is made for Windows 8 and the Insider Preview for Windows 10.  Asus has since updated their driver on their support page (still not the latest Skylake Intel HD driver, but it fixes the issues), and you CAN use the generic Intel driver from Intel's page...but both of these options will have you pulling your hair out unless you know the work around, as both of these options give an error &#34;This driver is not verified for your device&#34; when you try to install them.<br /><br />*****HERE IS THE FIX!!!*****<br />(Links to both Asus' site and Intel's site in comments, Amazon wouldn't allow external links in the review)<br /><br />You can download either the updated Asus driver from their support website (slightly out of date) or obtain the most recent Intel driver; both will work to solve the crashes/inconsistencies.<br /><br />Download either of these, and extract them somewhere easy to remember (Desktop or Downloads folder is fine).  DO NOT INSTALL THE SETUP.EXE, THIS WILL NOT WORK!<br /><br />Instead, click on the start button (or hit the start button on your keyboard), and type &#34;Device Manager&#34;.  After typing the first few letters, you should see it populate in the list on your Start menu and be able to either hit enter or click on it.  From there, click on the little &#34;&#62;&#34; next to &#34;Display Adapters&#34;, right click on &#34;Intel(R) HD Graphics 530&#34; and click on &#34;Update Driver Software&#34;.  This will bring up a new dialog box.  In this box, click on &#34;Browse My Computer for Driver Software&#34;.  Do not Search or Browse, but instead click on &#34;Let me pick from a list of drivers on my computer&#34;.  Once this window is up, don't click on any of the suggestions it gives you, instead click on the &#34;Have Disk...&#34; button on the bottom right.  NOW in this window, you click on &#34;Browse&#34;, then navigate to where you extracted the driver package you just downloaded from either Asus or Intel.  There will be a folder in your download named &#34;Graphics&#34;, open that up, and you're going to want to point this installer to the file &#34;igdlh64.inf&#34;.  Click on Open, and proceed to install the driver this way.  If your computer prompts you to restart, please do.  If it does not prompt you to restart after installation, do it anyway.<br />NOTE: This will be the only time you will have to update the Intel HD driver in this manner, from now on you will be able to install both the generic ones and the Asus ones via the install .exe as intended.  This will fix your Windows 10 Intel HD related crashes and instabilities.<br /><br />That's it for this review, enjoy, good luck, have fun with a very solid, very quiet, very cool (except on the left side by the ventilation...holy moly, it keeps my coffee warm) laptop.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/8/2016:<br />This laptop is nothing short of amazing for the money.  I now use it regularly in conjunction with a [[ASIN:B008ZT8QKO Hauppauge - HD PVR 2 Gaming Edition High Definition Game Capture Device]] for my Twitch stream (shameless plug: twitch.tv/phydeaux86) to capture gameplay from my desktop PC, PS4, & Xbox One.  When I'm not using it for streaming and recording...which it handles like a champ...I have also started playing more recent games like Tom Clancy's The Division...which also runs flawlessly.  (Again, also using other apps such as Discord, Skype, OBS, DXtory, Steam, etc. simultaneously.)<br /><br />UPDATE 7/25/2016:<br />Nothing but positives to give this laptop.  I have still delayed in getting an m.2 SSD for this (although a friend who bought the identical model has one, and the boot time is insane), yet it runs amazing.  I have barely touched my desktop due to owning this laptop.  I have even been playing DOOM on medium-high settings at 1080p on this.  Granted, I'm not a 144hz/300fps/0ping PCMR gamer...so there ARE some frame drops in this hefty of a game, but I average a good 40ish FPS while playing at these settings, more when not streaming.

5,Amazing boars for both 8th and 9th gen intel!,The board is perfect for enthusiasts to build with! Supports both 8th gen and 9th gen giving head room for upgrades. The board has a great BIOS with loads of options and the XMP profiles are very fine tuned along with various other great features on the board. It runs cool and the io both externally and internally in perfect. WiFi is insanely fast on it and the receiver as cheap as it feels is perfect since it is magnetic and can be adjusted.,1,True

5,PERFECT alternative to Scythe or Noctua. AMD mounts easily. Intel 17xx included.,"I have the gray PA120, absolutely the best value in my build and the best cooler I've owned. I think they fixed the mounting issue with some, mine mounted just as easily as Noctua on my AMD 5600x. Mine also included the new Intel 17xx mounting kit, which appears to be a new addition since a new Intel sticker was added to the box.<br /><br />Even without the price difference, I returned a Scythe Fuma 2 because this Thermalright PA120 looks and feels like the better product. I can see solder at the joint between the cold plate and the heat pipes, cheaper coolers usually leave that out, and I could only see gaps in the Scythe. Watch the youtube benchmarking videos comparing this to the others, it actually outperforms most air coolers in any price range.<br /><br />The fans are nice. They feel better quality than the Arctic fans I returned, but not quite as nice as my Noctua Redux. The plastic is resilient, the bearings are fluid dynamic, and the gray matches my Noctua Redux fans. Even if you like other fans, adding them to this cooler will still probably cost less than other coolers.<br /><br />All needed hardware is included. Personally, I used Noctua thermal paste, only because of its reputation to release easily on removal. Nobody talks about the Thermalright paste online, so it's probably fine.",5,True

4,Budget CPU that is comparable to the junior level Intel i5 chips,"I purchased the FX-6100 as part of my desktop upgrade. I needed speed at an affordable price so this chip was a fit for me. I use my PC for video editing, picture editing, browsing online, and streaming movies. For gaming, the CPU is only mediocre; this CPU will not perform nearly as well as the Intel i5's like the i5-2500 quad cores. Also, the FX-6100 CPU is power hungry, rated at 95 watts, which will heat up a small office fast. On the other hand, in pricing, the AMD FX wins compared to the Intel's i5 CPUs.<br />Most PC games use just 2 cores and rarely 4 cores. Games today do not take advantage of the multiple cores in some chips, especially 6 or 8 cores which are underutilized during gaming.  AMD APUs like the A8 and the newer A10 will be a better choice for gaming due to its advanced CPU and GPU combination on one chip die (an A8 APU alone will allow the PC to play games that require DirectX 11, currently the latest revision for the gaming market). The AMD APUs are also more energy efficient and better on the budget because purchasing a video card is not required (a Crossfire video card can be added later to complement the AMD APU). My next upgrade will be from an AMD FX CPU to the AMD APU socket FM2 or better.<br />I am still impressed with the FX-6100 because it allowed me to install Windows 8 Pro and the free Windows Media Pack in under 20 minutes. A fast processor and a SSD like the Crucial 128 6GB/s solid state drive is essential for improving speed of installs and PC cold starts. My FX-6100's CPU Windows Experience Index (WEI) is 7.4., and the Crucial 128GB Sata3 WEI is 7.7 out of 9.9 max.",0,True

5,When In Doubt go Intel,"Friends..let us reason together. Let us cast aside specs on boxes and video reviews from shady individuals with agendas. I searched hi and low on mountains and through valleys. I scoured the depths of the internet doing research on what processor I should get for my very first budget gaming build. Hear me friends!! I almost..almost I say..almost was hoodwinked into buying that amd fx 6300. If you haven't figured it out yet I'm about to figure it out for you. Thank me by pushing that little helpful review button. I know 6 or even 8 cores of blazing fast amd processor a budget friendly price is almost too much to pass up..but I urge you to pass it up and never look back. If you don't remember anything else I write seal this within your brain housing group. Architecture is what matters my brethren and sistren. Intel has the faster, more efficient architecture. So to make a looooong story short...the dual core i3 6100 with its 3.7 smokes a six core amd fx 6300. Forget about over clocking it....forget that it has 6 cores...forget the pricetag. Forget it and buy the i3 6100 if that's your budget limit. Now pair that with a gtx 960 and enjoy seamless 1080 gaming at reasonable frame rates at medium or better. Hardcore gamers will need better. Think about your build. If you get that old lame amd chip you gotta get that old lame motherboard and ddr3 ram. All you can upgrade to is the 8 core fx chips which still have that lame architecture. You buy the i3 skylake chip and the 1151 motherboard and ddr4 ram and you have multiple amazing options for upgrading the processor when you get all that money. Don't be a sucker.

5,Outstanding Intel Processor,"After writing this review, I realized it is as much about the Intel Q6700 process as it is about the Dell Precision Workstation and Dell Support.  After some consideration, I'm leaving it this way as one can't separate a processor from its system and still expect either to function.<br /><br />I bought my Intel Q6700 processor as an upgrade for my Dell Precision 390 workstation around 3 years ago.  It has been solid to this point.  While the Intel chip comes with a three year warranty, I bought mine from Dell for a Dell system also under warranty.  The cool thing about the Dell warranty is if you buy the parts from Dell they will warranty it for as long as the system warranty is good.<br /><br />So for this review, I've been using this product for quite awhile and without any issues at all.  It is a stable and outstanding processor.<br /><br />I'm using this processor with Microsoft Windows XP Professional x64 (64-bit) and with 8 GB of RAM.  It supports both multi-processor applications and multiple applications at the same time without any negative issues.  Even when I peg the system for hours on the CPU and RAM usage the Intel Q6700 continues to function without any visual issues on heat or incorrect results.<br /><br />I have yet to see one issue with the processor or the RAM and use it in many different types of applications from games (e.g. GTA III, Final Fantasy XI, to Stardock Systems Galactic Civilization), to video editors, to Visual Studio 2008, to MS-Office 2007, etc.  The really great part is the system supports using all of these applications at the same time.  (I run the games in a Window and not full screen (except GTA III)).  I can run both multiple-processor and multiple applications at the same without any problems from either the system or the Intel Q6700.<br /><br />As for heat with a quad process and 8 GB of RAM, Dell used their CPU fan and installed an add-on fan designed to cool both the RAM and SAS drives (though, I'm using SATA II drives, I also have all the drive bays fulls with various units like the Dell 19-in-1 card reader).<br /><br />Should you, also, put this into a Dell Precision Workstation (e.g. upgrade from the default dual processor), you'll want to upgrade to the latest version of the BIOS.  I will say when Dell first installed the processor, I got an error message saying the BIOS didn't support quad processors, yet, it ran like a champ on all four cores.  Dell later issues a BIOS update resolving this error message.  (Since Dell installed the processor they also assured me even without the upgraded BIOS they supported the combination.)",3,False

I am not doing any overclocking on the cpu.<br /><br />The case with both fans attached (you can do just one if you want) is very large.  I didn't have issues with ram clearance on my EVGA (nvidia chipset) motherboard, but the motherboard has a chipset cooler fan that was difficult to get both fans around.  It just barely fits.

I just cut a hole for it to pull air from outside the case across the heatsink with the other fan pulling the air through to the inside.<br /><br />The fan connectors are only 3 pin versus 4, but I have my fans set to run at 100% speed always anyway.

5,"First Intel based system ever, I'm impressed MSI. Keep it up.","Upgraded my rig from an ASRock Fatality based AMD A10 system to this with an i5 and so far so better. The board itself is attractive and fits with my black and red motif. The features on it and the bios fit my needs perfectly although the second PCI-e port is only an x16 running at x4 rather than x8. Short of trying to create a dual Titan X or Fury setup, this board is a beast of a budget friendly board without being cheap. Runs a 290x perfectly which the prior board would not. (still no idea why).<br /><br />The number of SATA/M2 ports is perfect with 6 SATA and 2 M2's. Plenty of space on the board for larger HSFs. The LED strip header is a nice add-on. The raw size of the board is great too, the ASRock was a bit on the small side vs the H270 which fits all 9 of my case mount points.<br /><br />The BIOS has a number of great features as well although some of the options, like time and date, are in odd places. Once I put some time in the BIOS started to make a bit more sense, easy of access is reasonable if different from what I'm used to.<br /><br />All in all a solid product, my gf has an MSI board that's 7 or so years old and has worked flawlessly, I'm hoping this one will perform just as well. So far so good.",7,True

5,Intel Network 6235AN.HMWWB Centrino WiFi Card Half Mini PCI Express...,"I have two PH Envy DV laptops (one DV6 and the other a DV7) that I purchased from Costco and as such, you could not order a dual band radio for either.  Still, the price was good and I thought I could live with it.  Well, I started to find that I really wanted the second band and so tried to buy it from HP.  Needless to say, that was a wasted effort!!!  I was told everything from the radios are part of the motherboard and cannot be changed to no one makes a dual band radio.  Funny, when you look up their manuals for parts you find a part number and listing for a Intel Centrino 6235AN.  I pointed this out to their parts department and I was told that part never made it to market.<br /><br />So, I went to my trusty Amazon website and low and behold, found the part that supposedly never made it to market!!  So, I ordered two of these and installed one in each laptop.  Not only do they work, they work MUCH better than the piece of junk that HP put into the laptops.  Besides gaining the 5Ghz band, I also gained Bluetooth!!!  So, now I have both bands and Bluetooth, what is not to like!!!<br /><br />The only thing I had to do was go to the Intel site and download the software for this radio.  Very simple and that took care of  the wireless and of the Bluetooth.<br /><br />I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with HP Envy series dv6 or dv7 with an Intel chip in it.",1,True
4,"Good for the price, but not perfect.  Center channel speech intelligibility lacking.","For the price, I am pretty happy with this sound bar, but I am a little bit disappointed with the center channel speech intelligibility.<br /><br />The numerous reviews for good sound quality were a primary reason I chose this model and on a positive note, I do think the stereo left and right channels as well as the sub-woofer sound pretty good.  The issue I have is that the center channel sounds a bit &#34;muddy&#34; to me and as a result, some voices tend to be a bit hard to clearly hear.  Further investigation by removal of the front grill reveled that the center channel does not have a tweeter and consists of two small full-range drivers in a ported plastic enclosure.  The left and right channels are a 2-way design with two larger size mid-woofers and a tweeter per channel.  I am a bit disappointed that they did not make the critical center channel in the sound bar a proper 2-way design, using identical drivers as in the left and right channels.  For this reason, I am removing one star.  Given the relatively low price, I am not overly disappointed, but I was hoping for better speech intelligibility on the center channel.  I find that reducing the bass helps a bit to clear things up.<br /><br />One other thing I am not a fan of is that when parred with Bluetooth for stereo music playback, the sound bar uses all 5 channels in some sort of simulated surround mode.  To listen to music strictly in stereo, you need to use the remote control to turn off &#34;surround&#34; which I normally keep on for 5.1ch movie watching through the optical input.  I would strongly prefer that stereo content through Bluetooth come through in stereo with the &#34;surround&#34; mode off by default.",1,True

Easy overclocking with the Gigabyte X370 gaming 5  board pushing 4.0ghz easily straight from the bios.<br /><br />UPDATE: it has been six months since I have purchased my 1800 x and I am still enjoying every single moment of having it installed. My computer is the entertainment system for my entire family and with the 1800 x it allows so much more functionality. Not only can I multitask without stutter issues there's no heating problems it runs pretty cool even when I'm overclocked. By far the best purchase of any CPU that I've ever made. Some people will disagree and tell you the 1700 or 1700 x is the way to go but I do not regret my purchase whatsoever. I get far better cinebench scores then my friends with the 1700 x.

4,Solid performer but beware Intel driver issue,"Update 9/8/14: As time wears on, and the scar heals over (see below regarding Intel driver issue), I have returned to say that my two Crucial M500 ssds drives are going strong. One on my Windows 7 Asus laptop and the other on a 13"" Macbook Pro. Review upgraded from 3 to 4 stars<br /><br />Update 11/21/13, 20:20: I've had success getting Windows Update to work again by installing the Intel Rapid Storage Technology driver, but it took me hours (well into the double-digits) trying and failing with various other fixes listed on Microsoft's site and elsewhere. I should have gone straight to the Crucial forums (see below). Also, someone quickly posted a comment in response to this review suggesting pretty much the same thing that others on the Crucial ssd thread had done - install the latest Intel Rapid Storage Technology (RST) driver.<br /><br />Review upgraded from 1 to 3 stars which may go up but the experience of getting this ssd to work correctly with my system was scarring. No need to read on unless you care to feel what it's like to beat your head against a wall, or want to compare notes.<br /><br />******************************<br /><br />Yes, the ssd is noticeably faster than the hdd it replaced, but there's a critical problem. I have a Windows 7 laptop and after cloning my old hdd to this drive, Windows Update will not work, which is a game-stopper. The .NET 4.0 installer also did not work for me. Other stand-alone Windows updates/fixes also fail. This is a known issue that Crucial is working on.<br /><br />If you go to Crucial's forum boards for their ssds and search ""Windows updates fail with M500"", you will find a helpful thread where several people have had this problem. For some, deleting or updating the Intel Matrix Storage Manager fixed the issue. For others it did not. Matrix Storage Manager didn't show up in my list of programs to uninstall so I assumed that wasn't my issue.<br /><br />I've gone through 3 different cloning processes without complete success, and by complete I mean that I get a fast booting drive where everything seems to work well except that you cannot install any Windows updates. The 1st attempt I spent a lot of time trimming the contents of my old hdd (personal files, audio & video files etc, uninstalling unnecessary programs), defragging and general maintenance, but otherwise not many OS changes. After discovering that Windows Updates failed and that I couldn't get .NET to update to 4.0, and having no success finding a fix, I was forced to reinstall my old hdd because an essential application I use requires .NET 4.0. A couple of months later, I tried again. Don't ask me why I expected anything different or didn't return the drive immediately, but I was very busy and a friend was bragging that he successfully migrated from his hdd to ssd and wow what a difference it made. He migrated to a Samsung 840 EVO in his 2013 Asus laptop running Windows 8. I've got a 2010 Asus laptop running Windows 7, no Service Pack. Thinking my drive enclosure might have introduce a problem, I borrowed his and cloned again. No dice. All Windows related Updates fail.<br /><br />I tried all the Windows KB fixits listed in the Crucial ssd forumm thread I cited above but those failed because ""The installer encountered and error: 0xc8000247"" (I'm assuming this is related to the same reason Windows Update doesn't work). I tried one where Microsoft also listed manual instructions using the command line to change something about Windows Update Logs, but that failed as well. The only other suggestion which I am trying now is to update to Windows 7 Service Pack 1 (*I now know this isn't necessary as Windows is now updating on the ssd with the plain Windows 7, no Service Pack). I'm surprised that in the 2 years I've had this machine that it wasn't already installed, but before this 3rd attempt, I did a system restore which took my OS back to baby brand new so I guess that was pre-SP1. I'm now in the process of updating my old hdd with as many Windows updates as I can (including SP1) until I'm up to date and then cloning to the ssd. If that doesn't fix the issue, this M500 is being returned.<br /><br />I've read that lots of headaches of migrating/cloning are avoided by installing Windows 7 on the sad from scratch but my system came with in the OS installed and called for the user to create a set of System restore disks after the 1st boot up. So the only option I have (within my skill set and allotment of time) is to clone the old to the new.<br /><br />Was this painful to read? Trust me, it's been a royal pain for me to go through. Many many hours of time wasted, many more that I should have spent in retrospect.<br /><br />btw, for those interested I used the free EaseUS to clone and had ""optimize for ssd"" checked. The ssd sector alignment checked out ok so that apparently isn't the issue. btw, if you do use Ease US, remember to select custom installation otherwise you'll get unwanted adware, another pain-in-the-butt added to this whole process.<br /><br />I will update this review accordingly after I've finished this final attempt at cloning with the OS known to be SP1 and with all the KB fixes applied before I do the clone.",32,True

We decided to use this in the kitchen where we are frequently running difference appliances while also keeping phones and portable speakers charged up to listen to music while I cook and can.  I like the color code system too which at first we were honestly a bit confused by but only because we didn't thoroughly read the instructions to know what each color meant.  This works perfectly for our older house with terrible wiring by giving me a heads up when I might be pulling too much power from one source.  We frequently blow fuses here because of this and now I don't have to worry about that happening if I pay close attention to the lights on the surge protector.

2,"Something is not quite right with this ""Advanced Intelligent Smart"" charger","I purchased this [[ASIN:B00HN2Y2MK EBL® 920D LCD Rapid Advanced Intelligent Smart Individual Cell Battery Charger]] because I'm desperate. People kept asking me to recommend a smart charger that can handle individual cells, but most chargers I recommended in the past (such as [[ASIN:B001DL9WDG Sony BCG34HRE]] and [[ASIN:B000XSBVK2 Duracell CEF23]]) have been discontinued. The EBL 920D looks promising with a LCD panel that shows the status of each cell individually. In my actual testing, however, it just does not live up to all the hypes.<br /><br />First of all, whether this charger can be called 'Rapid"" depends on how many cells you are charging. When charging 3 or 4 cells at once, the charging current is just 300mA according to spec sheet (actual current appears to be even lower). That means it will take at least 8 hours to recharge a set of 2300mAh batteries. So it is more like an overnight charger than a 'rapid' charger.<br /><br />Next, whether this charger can be called ""smart/intelligent/advanced"" is highly questionable. This is because according to my testing, it does not seem to terminate charging reliably.<br /><br />To start with, I tested charging a set of 4 partially discharged [[ASIN:B004UG41XW eneloop AA cells]]. The LCD panel initially starts with rolling segments (0-1-2-3, etc). After a few hours, only the top two segments are toggling (2-3-2-3...). So it appears that the charging is nearly done. However, something is not quite right because it stayed in this state for the next 12 hours! When I finally removed those batteries, they were all warm to the touch, which means they were being over-charged by the full 300mA current, instead of a lower trickle current.<br /><br />For my second test, I started with a set of 4 [[ASIN:B000XSA60I Duracell StayCharged AA Batteries]]. I checked their capacities using the [[ASIN:B00JL3XL2G BT-C2000 Battery Charger Analyzer]] and they were between 1919 and 1979mAh, for an average of 1954mAh. Next, I drained them down using the BT-C2000's DISCHARGE function, and then inserted them into the EBL 920D for charging. The EBL charger went through its motion of flashing LCD bars for the next 6 hours. Shortly after 6 hours, all 4 channels stopped flashing and showed solid 3-bar, which means batteries were fully charged. Something is not quite right because this charge time is shorter than expected. (To fully recharge a 2000mAh battery at 300mA should take at least 7 hours)<br /><br />I then re-checked the capacities of those cells in the BT-C2000. To my dismay, the readings were all over the place between 1373 and 1799mAh, for an average of 1583mAh. This is just 81% of the original average capacity of 1954mAh.<br /><br />So what have I observed so far?<br />1. For my first set of partially drained batteries, the EBL 920D missed charge termination signal and over-charged them.<br />2. For my second set of completely drained batteries, the EBL 920D terminated charging prematurely, when batteries were just around 80% full.<br />3. The charging current is not uniform across different channels. So although all 4 batteries were charged for the same 6 hours, they did not receive the same amount of energy.<br />4. There is a high-pitch noise (2-3KHz) coming from the unit when charging. It is clearly audible in a quiet room.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />On the surface this EBL 920D looks like an advanced charger, but it cannot even perform basic charging task correctly. If I had only spent 5 minutes to give this product a courtesy scan, I would probably also give it a 5-star rating. Unfortunately for me, I just have to dig deeper and discover its flaws. My quest for an inexpensive but SMART charger continues...<br /><br />[Update on June 28, 2014]<br />I re-tested charging my Duracell batteries using the EBL 920D, this time leaving it overnight. The measured capacity numbers are essentially the same as before, ranging from 1415 to 1851mAh. This charger is going back for a refund.",79,False

If you are also expecting to make this chip work for its money, I would advise looking into a more industrial CPU cooling fan and heat sink combo.  Otherwise, couldn't be happier!",0,True
4,Intel Hackintosh,"I built a Hackintosh with this board and installed Mac OS 10.5.6 via 10.5.4 using info on the insanelymac forums. The unit might barely play 720p MPEG2 HD video with Quicktime or EyeTV but seems to gag on 1080i or on 720p H.264.  But I am not sure that I have the drivers optimized for this board. I'll update if I find out how to get better performance. From the specs, I would have expected it to be almost on par with the last generation Mac Mini Intel Core Duo with Intel Graphics, which can handle 1080i MPEG2.<br /><br />The system is fine for web browsing, word processing, and even for iPhoto and for standard def Quicktime movies.<br /><br />Getting the sound chip to work is a hassle. I accidentally got it to work using the hacker community recommendations, and then I reinstalled the OS, and now I can't get it to work again. Only output sound works when it works. I've never gotten the input sound to work. So far, that is in agreement with the hacker community.<br /><br />The video worked out of the box but treated my monitor as generic. Updating the drivers with the hackers' version fixed that. It can now detect my Viewsonic model.  The rest of the hardware just worked, including the gigabit ethernet. Too bad it doesn't have a DVI or HDMI output. I haven't tested the S-Video output. No problem yet (1 week) with the fan others have complained about.<br /><br />I had parts sitting around (HTPC case, hard disk, DVD-RAM/RW/W drive). I had to buy a 2G DDR2 ram stick for $22. I bought PC-6400 because it is backward compatible with PC-5300.  If I bought everything new at today's (discounted or sales) prices, my total cost would be about $230 for the hardware. Not bad. But in about 4 months, I should be able to put together an Nvidia Ion Atom 330 system with much better graphics performance and HDMI and maybe dual monitor support for about the same price. I'll probably pull the Intel board and replace it with the Nvidia board.  I'l have to buy some DDR3 memory.",3,True
1,Intel now ships with Plastic backplate :(,I just bought this cooler.. But it now ships with a plastic backplate that has metal nuts inside.. As you tighten it will just strip and the nuts will spin inside the plastic backplate.. Intel dropped the ball on this. If you can not have 100% sure contact?

5,Impressive 4K camera with Intelligent detect feature,"[[VIDEOID:b66424cefc438c179b1237378812d9b4]] I have started to replace my older cameras, and this model has the features that I needed (i.e. 4K, Intelligent Detect, good night vision).<br /><br />ONVIF compliant was a must in order to use with my older PoE NVR which is also ONVIF compliant.  However, I wasn't expecting all new features of the camera to be compatible with my old NVR.<br /><br />If the advanced camera features are not displayed by the NVR, you can instead connect to the camera's IP address (via your laptop / web browser) and view/configure the camera settings.<br /><br />After using this camera for a couple of weeks, it has surpassed my expectations.<br /><br />What I really like about this camera:<br /><br />- Solid/sturdy camera case.  Protects the camera very well from weather/rain.<br />- Uses PoE, or a separate 12V power supply.<br />- Incredible 4K color day image.<br />- Very good color image in low light conditions(i.e. without night vision LED).<br />- Uses just two LEDs for night vision.  Can easily see up to 100 feet and very good image.<br />- Intelligent Detect (Human / Car).<br />- Motion Detection.<br />- Customization of the day/night mode settings as well as image customization.<br />- Ability to set day/night mode lighting thresholds - this is a nice feature.<br /><br />Not crazy about:<br />- The camera's ethernet connector cable has a green LED, which I suppose helps you determine connection to the NVR.  This LED is unnecessary.<br /><br />Important camera features:<br /><br />- Intelligent Detect (ID):<br />This feature is my favorite, and is very reliable  It eliminates false alarms such as shadows, moving branches and bugs by allowing detecting certain objects (i.e. cars, humans, bikes).<br />Detect humans and cars at longer distances  (i.e. 50 - 60 feet).  Works perfect!!<br />When a human/car is detected, a rectangular box is drawn on the object and tracks the object.  This rectangle shows up on the live image and the playback recording on the NVR.<br /><br />- Motion Detection:<br />This feature works great for both day/night and will detect anything that moves, so yes, you will get false alarms, but you can minimize this via adjusting the day/night sensitivity settings.<br />To minimize false alarms, you can adjust the sensitivity.<br /><br />- Day / Night Mode:<br />- Switch between day/night mode via three options: 1) Schedule, 2) Manually set or 3) Automatically (sensor).<br />- The ""light on illumination"" allows more granularity on how much dark/light there is when the night vision turns on/off.  In other words, you don't want the night vision LEDs to automatically turn on/off to early/late.<br />- Manually control the night vision brightness (i.e. 10%, 20%, 50%..etc).  - nice feature!!<br /><br />On image quality, the 4K video is crystal clear during daytime.  Camera supports up to 20FPS (main stream) which is fine, but 25FPS would have been better.  At night time, with night vision enabled, images are extremely clear.  The two night vision LEDs do an excellent job at ""lighting"" up the area.<br /><br />The camera image looks great in very low light conditions.  Even when it is getting dark, the camera can filter out that ""darkness"" and show a clear color image WITHOUT the night vision LEDs.  Very impressive.<br /><br />Finally, there are numerous settings to adjust the image, such as brightness, contrast, saturation, sharpness, WDR, day/night shutter and image flip, privacy mask and many more settings.<br /><br />Overall, This is a very good 4K camera with great features that I really like (and use a lot).  Works well with my ONVIF compliant PoE NVR.  I have experimented quite a bit to get the best day/night image view as well as alarm customization, and all has been working great so far.  Have not had any technical issues.",0,True
1,How do you Use This Thing? HATE the Unintelligible instructions.,"I'm really frustrated with this device. I purchased it for recording research interviews. The manual is absolutely useless. After going through the 'manual' three times - the only thing I've been able to figure out is how to turn it on and off. . .

Where is the playback function???? I cannot for the life of me figure out how to get it to playback - provided anything was recorded in the first place. I've already lost a valuable 1 1/2 hour interview - or at least I think it's been lost due to the fact that if it IS on the device - I can't play it back. The company should invest in hiring a native English speaker/writer to create a manual that's actually intelligible.  {BTW- If anyone knows a website or video where the functions of this device are explained - or demonstrated, PLEASE direct me to it!!!] For those considering purchasing this recording device - consider how willing you are to 'play' with it until you stumble on the features for which you purchased it in the first place. . .

5,"How to make it fit for Intel LGA 1155 for i7, 3770k and Geforce","Ok, I made it work :) and this cooler is more huge than I expected it to be.<br /><br />The LGA 1155 Socket is official not supported for this very cheap water cool block. I just bought it instead of building me a selfmade one since it was only 20$. So I only had to manage to make it fit on my Geforce GTX 560 TI and on the new LGA 1155 socket.<br />They say it works for i7 types, but notice there are different sockets available, 1155 is NOT one of them ;)<br /><br />1st of all there are lots of preview videos of the package content. Check those out to see the content.<br />I can additionally say: Those backplates are extremely hardened and damaged some of my drills while trying to fit them for the new socket.<br /><br />Installing top part:<br />So here is the problem: LGA 775 is supportet which has 75mm hole distance, the new 1155 has only 72mm. The picture for the master plate is not correct anymore. There are 2 holes each side, so it comes a bit larger as in the picture here. Now the 1155 socket just needs to be connected between the 2 holes on this OCZ chrome top plate. Hard task to drill just between to wholes. I finally connected those holes and thats all you need to do. After that the cooler top part will fit the 1155 socket.<br /><br />The backplates: I don't know about other mainboards, but mine actually had a huge Intel backplate for the CPU holder installed. Therefor I was not sure if I even need another one. To be safe I have done the additional work. Problem is, with that I had too much distance to the board and the screws were not long enough. Additionally they were screwed INTO the backplate. After I drilled some new holes in it, you would need longer screws and some kind of nut to screw it in. The backplate itself is too hard to screw anything inside a new hole. I managed to use the thinnest backplate and bent it closer to the screws. Took quite a while and used my own micro nuts to connect them. I guess if you dont rise the pressure too high you can leave out the backplate part and find some nuts to directly connect the top cooler part without an additional backplate.<br /><br />The rumor of some benchmarks:<br />Actually some say to grind down the copper step in the center would help fitting the CPU or DIE size for better cooling. The opposite is the case. But maybe it works for you. The I7 Ivy Bridge (1155) has a DIE of 160mm² and this cooler center part is 240mm² huge. That means that the DIE alone is getting higher pressure and is fully covered by this awesome liquid cooler. Of course some mm of the ""heat spreader"" of the CPU is not having contact, but it actually is only a heat spreader. If I could I would remove it, but that killed my last cpu. Don't get irritated - the heat spreader is just another copper plate on the DIE itself. So the chip is not that huge under that cover.<br /><br />The bigger chip is the Geforce GTX 560 TI. I already removed the heat spreader, but this cooler would not fit the DIE size directly so I went with the heat spreader on it + I had to mount the cooler diagonal since the screw holes of the GPU are too close together. It was luck that it was fitting this way. Now the chrome plate of the cooler must be removed. There are tiny plastic rings in the package as spaceholder if you go without that chrome plate. Very impressive, since they officially didnt support that I guess ;) The 4 screws are still needed to connect the copper+plastic part of this cooler. Of course the backplates will not fit at all to this video card and I just used 2 hard metal stripes, drilled 2 holes in it and made them press down the cooler with the original screws. You will find 2 screw lengths inside the package. The other pair I used instead of the backplate. Bit large and spiky looking, but the mounting thread fits this way the easiest. I have enough space above the card unlike behind the mainboard.<br /><br />The water connectors are very huge to this cooler and I had to buy new tubes to connect. They are now in the size as I use for my garden o.o. I actually had thin tubes as for pumping gas or aquarium. They were too small. So be prepared for huge fittings and tubes if you go with this. Sizes are: 1/2"" or 3/8"" barbs.<br /><br />#Tip: You can increase the pressure if you put a small nut between the spring and on top of the chrome plate. The Screws are long enough to support that much. But watch if your mainboard is bending.<br /><br />Ah btw: the temperatures are around 22-30°C on idle state for GPU and CPU connected (18°C room temp). Maximum so far in benchmark was: 45°-50°C CPU and 64°C GPU (GPU has had no trouble to hit 80°C before and would be at 74 with aircooling with a good brand) So all in all now I have space for future overclocking attempts. Before I was happy if my GPU didn't overheat itself and slowed down. Of course it depends on the water temperature too. I just use a 20 liter water bucket without ventilation to have it silent. So errors including the time of heating that ;)<br /><br />Enjoy modding this cooler, hope this was helpful. For me a very great improvement to my self made watercooling.",7,True

5,One of Intel's best processors yet.,"The i7-2600K is a last gen product but it's still a solid work horse for those on a budget. The K after the 2600 means that it's great for overclocking if that's your goal. The OS will see those 4 cores as 8 cpus and use each one according to the needs of the running program. That means if you suddenly see that one of the cores is running close to 100% then you're assured that, like James Bond 007, another core will be available to takes its place when needed. The onboard Intel video isn't as good as the newest generation but you can spend less than a C note on a dedicated GPU with at least a GB of video RAM that'll kick Intel's a$$ anyway. But even if you're just a modest gamer then you wouldn't be caught dead without a dedicated GPU anyway, right?<br /><br />If you can afford it I suggest going with the latest and greatest CPU since it'll give you the most longevity with all the latest technologies but for the most bang for your buck you can't go wrong with the 2600K.",0,True

4,Interference Summary  &amp; Comparison w/Wireless IntelliMouse,"As you can see from positive reviews, people love wireless mice because the freedom of movement and lack of clutter.  Complaints are usually due to poor reception.  FCC regulations dictate that ALL RF (radio frequency) devices MUST accept RF interference, so as a result, many people mistakenly blame the consumer RF devices (cordless phones, mice, etc) for poor performance.  It is important to keep this and all RF devices away from common home/office RF emitters (monitors, computer fans, and flourescent lights).  This done, you'll have no problems.  It may seem counter-intuitive as to keep the receiver far away from your PC and monitor as you may be tempted to keep it close to the mouse, but you should be more concerned about proximity to interference sources.  Keeping the receiver away from the monitor and PC, I have been able to get good reception up to 9 feet away (which is as far as I can possibly put the receiver with its 5 ft cord).  To compare this and other features of the Cordless Wheel Mouse to the new Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer, the IntelliMouse Explorer only will range 5 ft in the same location.  The resolution is comparible, despite the IntelliMouse's optical sensor, most likely due to the radio bottleneck.  Speaking of optical, this is the one key benefit of the IntelliMouse over the Cordless Wheel Mouse as it does not get dirty and skip like the ball on the Wheel Mouse and it operates on ANY surface except glass and mirror (jeans, papers, desk surface, etc).  The other key differentiator is the ergonomic shape of the IntelliMouse along with two extra buttons, although these make it a lefty whereas the Cordless Wheel Mouse fits both hands.  The last difference, is that the IntelliMouse has a USB connecter, making it hot-pluggable as well as compatible with Mac.  Also, it can change channels on the fly using a button on the mouse without adjusting the receiver as you must on the Cordless Mouse.  Furthermore, each Intellimouse has a unique code, preventing the receiver from &quot;listening&quot; to other mice.  These two mice even worked side by side on the same channel.  You can retrain the IntelliMouse receiver to listen to another mouse if you happen to need to use another one with it.  Using the latest IntelliPoint 4.0 software, both mice can take advantage of increased precision and wheel acceleration.  Bottom line: the Cordless Wheel Mouse is cheaper, lighter, longer range, and supports both hands whereas the Wireless IntelliMouse Explorer has optical ease, ergonomic design, 2 extra buttons, and USB plug and play support.",18,False

4,"Worked fine, unlike the new Intel motherboard it replaced","My son wanted a custom built machine, so we started by ordering an ATX case ([[ASIN:B002FB65CE Cooler Master RC-600-KKN1-GP Gladiator 600 Mid Tower ATX Case with 140mm Fan (Black)]]), an i7 CPU, and an [[ASIN:B002N2Z0JY Intel DP55KG Extreme Series Desktop Motherboard (P55 ATX Core i7 Core i5 LGA1156)]]. The Intel motherboard refused to accept any memory we put in it (three different varieties, all meeting the proper specs), so we could never get it to boot. We finally gave up on the Intel and got this instead.<br /><br />It was easy to install, with all sockets clearly marked. We assembled, plugged everything together, and it booted first time we turned on the machine. After a month of diddling with the Intel, that was a welcome relief.<br /><br />One minor quibble: The ATX case had a cable for a standard case speaker (you know, the one that beeps on startup), and I could not find a place on this motherboard to plug it in. The case also had HD audio plug slots on the font, and I could not find a place to plug the cable for that in either. But in our case, we're using the audio ports on the back, so the lack of those slots isn't much of a problem. Maybe there's a place I missed for those plugs, but if so, it's pretty hard to find.<br /><br />It comes with its own metal port cutout panel to place in the back of the ATX case. That went in easily, unlike some others I've seen.<br /><br />Performance is quite good with an Intel Core i7 870 CPU ([[ASIN:B002KQ5KEI Intel Core i7-870 2.93GHz 8 MB LGA1156 Processor BX80605I7870]]) and 16GB of memory in it.

1,Power cables too short for our new Intel motherboard,"Even though this power supply claims to be for the ATX case form factor, the interior power cables were not long enough to reach the appropriate plugs on an Intel motherboard for that same case. The main power cable (the big 24 pin one) was about half an inch short. The smaller one that plugs into the far corner of the motherboard was way short - over two inches.<br /><br />The motherboard in question is the Intel DP55KG. Several Intel motherboards have the same general layout, so I'd expect this issue to be a problem with all of them. It's possible someone in the factory was just not paying attention during manufacture/assembly, but of course in that case it's a quality control issue instead of a design issue.<br /><br />Otherwise seemed OK. Lots of power cables for disks, etc. Installed into its space in the case pretty easily. But none of that does me any good since I can't actually finish installation with it without extender cables.

2,Intel 10th/11th Gen CPU; 3 M.2 Slots; USB 3.2 Gen 2; 4 DDR4 slots (128GB max); PCIE 4.0; WiFi 6E,"Update: 5/15/2022 changed to 2 stars for the following reason:<br /><br />My initial review of this motherboard was written based on running with an i9 10900 CPU.  I was able to turn on XMP support so that my 128GB 3600Mhz DDR-4 RAM would run at 3600 Mhz frequency instead of the default 2666Mhz.  All was good till I upgraded my CPU to an i7 11700K.  The mothboard wouldn't boot at all when XMP being turned on.  As such, I could only run my RAM at the default frequency 2666Mhz.  I submiited an support issue to MSI looking for a solution.  I received only 1 reply asking for the firmware version.  After I told them that I was running the latest firmware according to their website, I haven't heard from them since.  I followed up with my case on their website only to find out that the case was closed.  I sent a message asking why it was closed without given any explanation.  Again there has been no response at all.  My case # is CSD050122004655 and my last message was sent on May 2, 2022.  Without getting any solution from MSI, I started to dig into the issue on my own, It turns out that if I only use 2 sticks instead of total 4 stacks of RAM (64GB instead of 128GB), the motherboard is happy to boot up with XMP being turned on with 3600Mhz factory rated frequemcy.  That means this MSI motherboard is having a real issue turning on XMP support with all 4 sticks of RAM.  Since I don't have other size of RAM, I can't confirm if this issue has to do with the number of sticks or the total memory.  I guess it is more likely with the number of sticks being installed.  There might be issues with power distributionto all 4 memory sockets  during boot up.  But that is an educated guess only as MSI is not responding to the issue at all.  Again, my educated guess is that MSI knows this issue but have no solution.  So my suggestion for anyone who is thinking to use the maximum RAM (128GB), you should either do it with i9 10900 CPU for sure or don't spend extra money to get 3200 or 3600 Mhz RAM with the goal for overclocking this MB.  Anyway, the reason I reduced my rating to 2 stars is because the poor product support from MSI.  It is very disappointed as I consider product support is an extension of the product features and performance.<br /><br />---------------------------- 5-star initial review below ----------------------------<br />I bought this MSI MAG Z590 motherboard to replace my Asus ROG Strix B560-A WiFi 6 motherboard.<br /><br />My configuration is:<br /><br />- Intel i9-10900 CPU<br />- 128GB 3600Mhz DDR4 memory<br />- Intel 670p M.2 2280 1TB NVMe SSD card<br />- Western Digital 1TB Black SATA Drive<br />- Asus GeForce GTX Strix-GTX970 video card<br />- Asus Xonar Essence STX PCIE-X1 sound card<br />- DVD-RW SATA drive<br />- 2 Apple Display Cinema 30"" DVI LCD monitors<br />- 850W ATX power supply<br /><br />Everything works well with the Asus motherboard except the USB 3.0 and USB 3.2 ports are not functioning properly.  It seems they are all under powered and unstable with extenal USB devices as such portable USB drives, USB/SATA docking station, etc.  After replacing the Asus motherboard with this MSI motherboard, beyond gaining an extra M.2 slot (total 3 vs 2 on Asus MB) and WiFi 6E vs WiFi 6 on Asus MB, everyone works well including all USB ports.  All external devices used to have problems with the Asus MB are now working as expected.  I'm very happy with this MSI motherboard.  I'm not sure if this is one of the benefits of the Z590 chipset over the B560 chipset on the Asus MB.  I think MSI's build quality might be better because when I contacted Asus on the USB ports issues, they would have told me about B560 chipset limitations if that was the case.  They asked me to send the motherboard back to Asus for repair.  I told them that this is my work from home PC thus I can't just send the motherboard to them with a backup.  That is why I decided to bought this MSI motherboard which took me a couple of hours to swap out the Asus MB with it.<br /><br />I do have a minor issue with the MSI MB.  The WiFi atenna comes with the MB seems to be too small.  As a result, the signal strength is weak on my PC placed under the table on the floor.  I have to replace it with a pair of higher gain atenna.  With the new atenna, the signal strength is full (4 of 4 bars) and link speed is 1201/1201 Mbps (receive/transmit).  I'd suggest MSI to ship with an external WiFi atenna with an extension cable so that the atenna can be placed on the desk while PC being under the desk.<br /><br />Overall, it is so far so good.

2,Intel Anti-Theft Service V2.0 by McAfee on Windows 8 Ultrabooks,"I installed Intel Anti-Theft Service V2.0 by McAfee on Sony and Samsung Core i5 Windows 8 touchscreen Ultra-books.<br />This product makes the most sense for Ultra-books with GPS location service activated.<br />Here are a few tips that may help you do a quicker installation:<br />1. Be sure to get the product version 2.0, supported by McAfee, and go to the correct ""new"" website. Don't buy the obsolete version or pay more than $25 for a year's subscription. You can download the product and buy the subscription directly from McAfee/Intel website. Google for ""intel anti-theft free trial"" - this will give you an extra 3 months free.<br />2. You MUST install the ""Intel Management Engine V8.x"" on your ultra-book before you install Intel AT. Sony Ultra-books have ME pre-installed, but Samsung Ultra-books do not.<br />3. I created an entirely separate account for each Ultra-book. This may or may not be necessary - the instructions are very poor. The general steps are:<br />a. Install the free trial (takes a while, be patient).<br />b. Create an account with an email address and password (this is part of the installation)<br />c. Create a unique 8-digit PIN for each Ultra-book (this is part of the installation).<br />d. Sync to the McAfee servers (this should be automatic, but there is a button you can click. If the sync is not successful after a few minutes, your installation is unsuccessful (the most common reason is that you don't have the Intel Management Engine Services running).<br />e. Optionally, click on the ""Renew"" link and add another 12 months to your subscription (you will then have 15 months total).<br />4. Finally, do not enable ""AT Suspend"" in the BIOS. If you do, your PC may fail to boot and appear nearly bricked. However, if you just reboot again, the ""AT Suspend"" gets disabled again in the BIOS and your system should be okay again. I and another user saw this behavior, but I don't recommend testing it because of the risk involved. I couldn't find any documentation on how to use this feature, but the procedure I did try looked like it should work - but did not.<br />Once you are done there is a cool website with GPS tracking of your laptop - this kind of technology is how the police recovered the late Steve Job's computers.<br /><br />[Update 9-15-2013] I cut my rating from 4 stars to 2 because of a new problem I observed on both of my PCs: When the file encryption feature of this product is turned on, and the PC is cycled through sleep and then resume, the user cannot write files anywhere on the hard disk! It took me over 30 hours to discover this problem. Then I reported it to McAfee support (or is it Intel?) and found out how pointless and time consuming that is. If you use this product, don't turn on the file encryption feature unless you never sleep or hibernate the PC.",5,False

This kit only comes with cloning software for Windows but the Apple OS X disk utility is capable of cloning already. In my case, it was irrelevant since the original hard drive was dead and couldn't be cloned anyway. There were no instructions for my particular situation. So what I ended up doing is using the Apple OS X disk utility together with the USB/SATA cable to reformat this drive. I had to use my friend's Mac to accomplish this since mine couldn't boot.

The PCH of i7-12800H supports AX211 and AX411 and is backward compatible with AX201. Literally speaking, the CNVio2 protocol at this time has no clear description of product compatibility and becomes inaccurate. Unfortunately, Intel's product documentation is not very clear about this, and vendors will either ask questions or simply repeat that AX211 and AX411 support CNVio2.<br /><br />There's a statement in the product description by seller ""Suitable to replace AX201 or AX211"" ---> Well, it is not suitable to replace AX201.

I am running two monitors and using a Logitech wireless keyboard and mouse. Intel has programs for NUCs on its website to download and keep the computer drivers and BIOS up to date. Very little fan noise. Runs cool in my configuration. I am planning to buy a NUC i5 for my use at the office and another for the house for photo and video editing. Great experience so far! No more big and bulky desktops for  me!<br /><br />Update: I bought one of the ""refurbished"" 8th Gen Intel i5 NUCs from OEM XS since my original purchase of the i3 NUC, and it came in factory packaging with all the parts, accessories and documentation (still sealed).

Since I have multiple devices that run in low powered mode, plus my daughter's Wii U that runs when she's using the gamepad's screen to play, I'm constantly getting up to re-plug devices to get this thing to detect what I want. At the very least, you'd hope the remote could override the ""intelligent"" detection, but it doesn't. The remote is basically useless. The remote is the main reason I wanted this. The ""intelligent"" detection overriders everything else. This thing is pretty sh*t as a result. Not happy at all. By the time I figured it all out, it was really too late to send back.

4,Intelligent Battery Charger Includes All The Right Features At The Right Price,"The Ambient Weather BC-2000 is an intelligent charger for AA, AAA, C & D Cells (C & D adapter sold as part of a separate kit) that brings together the best features of legendary chargers like the [[ASIN:B003DIGKOG PowerEx MH-C9000 WizardOne Charger-Analyzer for 4 AA/AAA Batteries]] and [[ASIN:B004J6DLD4 La Crosse Technology BC1000 Alpha Power Battery Charger]] at a very friendly price-point.<br /><br />The BC-2000 seems to be the updated version (v 2.1) for the [[ASIN:B00FTDHUVA Opus Tester Analyzer Battery Charger, 12V, Black]] and the BM-200.<br /><br />My primary purpose for batteries are game controllers, wireless computer peripherals, remote controls, home phones, flashlights and kid toys. Due to longevity issues I did want to upgrade from my Sanyo Eneloop charger to an intelligent charger, but the $50+ price-point wasn't appealing. I managed to pick up the [[ASIN:B000RSOV50 La Crosse Technology BC-700 Alpha Power Battery Charger]] around $35 and have never looked back. The single largest savings have been with my home phones (24 AAA batteries) that, due to the daily phone base re-charging, had reduced battery life to 300 cycles instead of the rated 1500 cycles. I was able to successfully refresh them to near full capacity every six months and have been able to get about 1200+ cycles out of each battery.<br /><br />The Ambient Weather BC-2000 is a step or two above my BC-700. The first obvious (very cool) feature is the backlight. It is my single most desired feature as I generally setup my charger in a corner of the room and it requires fumbling with a flashlight to go through the recharging options.<br /><br />There are 5 Modes - 3 charging modes and 2 test modes:<br />* Charge mode - In this mode, the charger does a simple battery recharge<br />* Discharge mode - Battery is discharged to 0.9V and recharged<br />* Refresh mode - Battery is repeatedly discharged/recharged (3 cycles each) to refresh old batteries or batteries experiencing a memory effect<br />* Test mode - Battery is charged and completely discharged to test battery capacity<br />* Quick Test mode - Charger tests and provides the internal battery resistance<br /><br />To start charging, insert batteries, select the desired ""Mode"" and desired ""Current"" to start charging. You can use the ""Slot"" button to set independent current for each slot. When charging 4 batteries charging current options between 200 mA - 1000 mA (1400 mA when using 2 batteries) are available, in 200 mA increments. I use 600mA for AA and 400 mA for AAA - keeps the batteries and charger cool and recharges my batteries in an acceptable time-frame (3-6 hrs)<br /><br />The charger has overheating protection and will switch off if temperatures exceed the thresholds - they will however, restart once the temperatures of the battery and/or control board come down to acceptable levels.<br /><br />Highly Recommended - With backlighting, independent battery charging and multiple charging/test modes at a 31 dollar price-point it's a no-brainer!<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Best price in class<br />* Includes the best (if not all!) features of high-end chargers in this class<br />* Simple, intuitive controls with dedicated keys make this charger accessible to non-techy users<br />* Multiple, independent charging options give you maximum flexibility and control<br />* Charging current options between 200 mA - 1000 mA (1400 mA when using 2 batteries - Slots 1 & 4) available in 200 mA increments<br />* Discharge current options between 100 mA - 500 mA (700 mA when using 2 batteries - Slots 1 & 4) available in 100 mA increments<br />* Backlighting for ease of use<br />* Charger runs very cool<br />* Comprehensive manual provides detail explanations<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Terminals have become slightly loose with just 10 insertion/extractions - is not currently impacting charging",2,False
5,Intel i3 is REALLY Responsive,"Acer has somewhat obnoxiously decided to reuse the same model number C720 for nearly every revision of their Chromebook line. This is undoubtedly confusing to consumers. This model, with an Intel Core processor (not the Intel Celeron chips from the previous generation) and 32GB of storage (not 16GB), is far more powerful than most of the competing models in this size range. There are more powerful Chromebooks available, but they're typically only available in larger form factors. This is more comparable in size and weight to the 11&#34; Mac Book Air model.<br /><br />This new and improved Acer Chromebook, with its speedy processor and better than average memory offering in its class, is fantastic. The keyboard and touchpad have a crisp feel to them, and are very responsive. The screen is bright and clear. The battery life is amazing, considering how much more powerful this processor is to previous Intel Celeron model. (Hint: the battery life is actually better than nearly every other 11.6&#34; Chromebook available at the time of its release. It's actually even better than my previous power-sipping, ARM-based Chromebook.) The included SD card slot was a must for me, as it means I can use my Chromebook to upload photos from my Canon SLR to Picasa or Flickr with ease.<br /><br />If you already own an Acer C720 Chromebook, there aren't really any differences to the body of the laptop. The plastic material is the same, and the keyboard and touch pad appear to be unchanged. I can't be completely sure, but the screen is probably the same as well (I have only been able to compare this to the 720P, which had a different screen). I was a little disappointed that Acer didn't decide to use micro USB for charging, as the HP 11.6&#34; model did, but the power supply is reasonably small.<br /><br />My previous Chromebook was the Samsung 11.6&#34; with an ARM processor, sometimes referred to as the Series 3. I loved the small form factor and the outstanding battery life, but over time, it really started to show its age. Page loading time was slow, even on fast wi-fi, and if I had too many tabs open, Chrome OS would dump some of them from memory. This meant that if I tried to go back to an old tab, it might try to reload the page from scratch. This was partly because of the ARM processor (where the focus is on efficiency, not processor power) and partly because it, like many other Chromebooks at the time, only came with 2GB of memory. So for me, upgrading to this revision of the Acer C720 was a revelation in how far Chromebooks have come.<br /><br />Are there any drawbacks? Well, the main thing is that there sounds like there might be a fan that kicks on under very high load. It's whisper quiet and hasn't turned on very often for me. There was a fan in the previous models of the C720 as well, but I didn't have one at all in the Samsung Series 3. The other thing, which will only affect a very tiny subset of people, is that there is no cellular modem option. This was a huge convenience with the Series 3, but the only Chromebook maker left that seems to include the option is HP. I'll miss it, but I was thinking about buying a separate hotspot anyway.<br /><br />Pros: Outstanding 8+ hours of battery life, 32GB of storage vs the 16GB in other models, fast page loads and fast scrolling<br /><br />Cons: No available cellular modem, and occasionally, there's very faint fan noise. It doesn't bother me, but I know that some people might be more sensitive to it than others.",7,True

This watch has so many useful apps like calculator, calendar, compass, voice recorder, fitness tracking, pulse, photo album, CNN news, and tons of other apps. They've even got apps to help you find your car. When bored I end up reading the news.  You can even use the watch to play the mp3s on your phone or stream music directly from the watch.  The real beauty of this is being able to make a call while driving by just talking to your watch and since its blue-tooth its legal.  It connects to the newer Samsung phones by blue-tooth, wi-fi, and S beam.  You can use it either as is or you can get its own (additional) sim card and then make the watch a dedicated phone that can also access and operate though your smartphone.<br /><br />You operate the watch and get to different screens and options by either swiping up, down, left, or right, and with touch, or by voice.  You will be surprised at the options this watch has.  I've never had an electronic watch before so I've got nothing to compare with, but speaking as someone who would have NEVER considered getting one of these watches now consider it indispensable.  The vibrating alarm is another one of the killer features and you can set multiple alarms and it is very easy to set repeating alarms.  You know ... to remind you of whatever you need being reminded about, maybe like the end of the workday, time to take medicine, pick up the kid, etc.<br /><br />The screen is big, crisp, colorful, and at first, I thought that it was too big for me but the screen size is just right and the resolution is awesome.  It tethers well to my Note 4 and don't have a sim card for the watch so only use it to answer calls and make calls though the cellphone.  What's even greater is this watch is voice activated.  Hopefully the next version will be android instead of Tizen so it can work even more apps but in the meantime I find this one heck of a useful watch that I never thought I'd like, but now love.  Even though I have a very thin wrist the length of the watch is perfect for it and the watch strap is very easily adjusted to accommodate very thin wrists.  You can even easily change the watchbands, if you need, by popping the watch out of the band.<br /><br />If you decide to use the skin for this watch (the skin is beautiful, easy to apply, and invisible after application) it will decrease the sensitivity of the touch screen.  I've tried it with the film but am annoyed at the loss of sensitivity so, currently, I'm using the watch without the protector.  I got accidental damage insurance on this so I guess I'll chance going without the protector due to the lack of responsiveness with the (invisible) skin on.<br /><br />12/18/14 I just became aware, today due to my negligence, that this SMART watch has figured out, on its own, where I live (via GPS), when I leave for work, the route I take and gives the road warnings and comparison timing by text to work, it knows the time I start work, where I work, when I leave work, my days off, and the route I take home.  It even tells me when I get home later than normal.  The watch also tells you if your ride to/from work was longer or shorter than the day before.  It is tracking you everywhere.  It must be using the GPS in the phone, time of day, regularity, steps taken,  and possibly other movement types to the watch along with data from the phone.  I now find it a little scary that this can track and figure out what you're doing and where.  I hadn't been paying attention to those messages that were coming off the watch until I cleared them all.  I guess we've got to wonder just how much tracking is going on without our knowledge and just how much this thing can really do.  Scary and now has me thinking and wondering if the security implications are worth it, but it is still a dang awesome smart watch!  Much more impressive now that I know this watch figures out what you do the more you use it.  If you are paranoid of the man then this watch is certainly not on your agenda.  Its basically a 24/7 tracker, something that some nosy folks may find quite interesting since this can follow where you are to the exact location every second you wear this watch.  Perhaps a tad too smart?  Very Orwellian.<br /><br />Don't forget to clear your notices on the watch or it will take forever to clear all the different types of notices when you finally realize you've been letting them pile up.  Delete after you view.  Don't remember a month later.  It took me forever to clear everything that built up for 28 days, not to mention the space the files took up.",19,False

5,"Safe, convenient, intelligent  and easy case  that looks good too","It is easy to pop the Kindle Fire into this. It holds it securely and all the ports line up. It is sturdy but fits the hand better than any other because they aren't using the outside case to hold the tab look at. Sleep mode is fast, the magnetic tab is thin but works. If you don't want to use it folds onto the back without bulk. Honestly, I never had a case with a point holder that held the pointer steady but was easy to insert.<br />The materials this is made of are perfect for their use. The design looks the same but there's a slight texture on the back that makes it easy to hold and not ""plasticy"" meaning sticky and cheap. The inside cover is a soft felt to protect the screen and ease sleep mode. It has slits in it that I thought were there for no particular reason. It divided padding without bulk. They even provide a microfiber cloth for the screen.

5,Somewhere between an intel SSD and the Samung 850 EVO,"If you're upgrading from a regular spinney hard drive, you'll notice a night and day difference.  Startup in seconds, programs available to be used immediately, etc,etc.  But that doesn't say much about this drive as it does SSDs in general; so where does the Corsair Neutron XTi (Corsair's flagship SSD) fit into the scheme of things?<br /><br />Well, for the very best, you'll want an m.2 PCIe NVMe (hopefully your motherboard can support).  Samsung's 950s come very close to intel's options, (which are currently top of the heap), but for a fraction of the price.  Still, you'll be paying north of $300 for ~500Gb, so you're still about 1.5x the cost of normal SSDs.  What will you get for all this?  Compared to an SSD, a second or two faster startup/programs, but compared to a regular hard drive, no comparison.  Toss your operating system and programs on here, and you'll waste much less of your life waiting for your PC to do things.<br /><br />Next in line are your 'normal' SSDs.  intel again tops this market, but this Corsair is no slouch, either.  I can't tell the difference between it and my Samsung 850 Pro, except on a few benchmarks, and it's quite a bit less costly.  Will you notice a difference between this and a Samsung 850 EVO on anything but a benchmark?

5,"Great CPU fan, stock for most Intel CPUs. Not enough for intense processing.+","This fan comes stock with the listed processors. It is a good fan for processors and is very open and provides a lot of air flow. For a general gaming build, there isn't anything wrong with this fan.<br /><br />If you're looking for a cooling product for an i7 that you plan on using to game and stream and process crazy algorithms at the same time, look elsewhere. This thing is going to cool your CPU as long as you're just playing and maybe some streaming, but if you're doing crazy processing, you're probably going to want to get something better.<br /><br />I picked this out for a friend building a gaming rig. I should say that I have the same fan, but it is not this exact purchase. Both of these fans perform well on our i5 processors, and keep the system cool while playing very demanding games. I play every game on ultra settings. One of the games I frequent is Natural Selection 2 which is processor dependent. It uses much more CPU than GPU to process physics and etc. This fan keeps my processor cool during all of this processing, even when I'm streaming to twitch.<br /><br />That said, I also play Subnautica. This game is new (still in Early Access) but is very well made and is very graphically intense. It requires quite a bit of processing, too. When I run this game on ultra settings without streaming, it is fluid and crisp. When I run it while streaming, it is slightly choppy and jerky. This is a result of one of two things: the processor just can't handle the math, or the processor is getting too hot. Based on the performance degradation that I see, the processor is likely just not strong enough (mid-gen i5) rather than overheating, but you should be aware that anything on this level likely needs a different cooler than this.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this processor to anyone who wants general cooling with no intense operations. If you're just playing games or using the PC like most people do, this is for you. But if you plan on serious multitasking, encoding video with your CPU (even if it's quicksync), you should likely get a better cooler.<br /><br />Overall: 10/10<br />Design: 10/10<br />Aesthetics: 10/10<br />Functionality: 10/10",3,True

5,Is better in every way than the stock Intel socket 1700 cooler,"Ignore the few oddball reviews claiming this cooler is inferior or no better than the OEM stock Intel 12th cooler. They did something wrong. Under identical conditions The Noctua NH-L9i results in temps around 10 degrees cooler than the Intel cooler AND with much less noise. With a six core i5-12400F running various CPU stress tests I couldn't get the CPU over 66C vs 75C with the Intel cooler. With a 8+4 core i7-12700F the Noctua kept it under 85C vs 95C with the stock cooler. I tested with the motherboard in open air under identical conditions. Your temps might vary with your case cooling but the fact is the Noctua outperforms the stock Intel cooler and is quieter while doing it. And that should always hold true.<br /><br />The Intel cooler has a round contact area that only makes contact with perhaps 60%-70% of the rectangular CPU heat spreader. That's just brain dead on the part of Intel. The Noctua cooler makes contact with the entire heat spreader which helps it remove significantly more heat. Further Intel puts stupid cosmetic plastic trim on their cooler which likely only further inhibits airflow. It's classic marketing department form over function.<br /><br />The difference in noise is huge. At any RPM the Noctua is much quieter. Even at full speed (a still low 2400 rpm) the Noctua is impressively quiet and it's subjectively a much more pleasant noise than the jet spooling up for take off noise of the Intel cooler at 100%.<br /><br />The NH-L9i also fit my very cramped mini-ITX Gigabyte Z690 motherboard beautifully. You can also get the Noctua fan shroud kit for some applications so it can pull cool outside air giving it another huge advantage over the Intel and other coolers.<br /><br />The Noctua also provides downward airflow that gets directed over the motherboard chipset, SSD, VRM, RAM, and other parts that really benefit from and are designed around a downflow OEM style heatsink airflow.<br /><br />Those complaining about the mounting tabs not being flush with the motherboard don't understand the need to tension the heatsink to the CPU. The whole idea is to use the mounting tabs as springs to create the perfect tension for the best CPU contact without over-stressing anything. It's a very smart design that creates the right amount of contact force when the arms ""bottom out"" against the motherboard.<br /><br />Overall this is a great cooler for a great many applications. If you want to run an over clocked K series CPU you likely need a bigger cooler. But for compact small form factor builds, this is the best cooler I know of and genuinely shames Intel's provided cooler.",3,True
1,Has Intel Given Up On The Desktop?,"There are many signs Intel no longer cares about the dektop. Intel claims this CPU was released last quarter in the USA but that doesn't seem to be true. None of the usual vendors (Newegg, etc.) have ever had them for sale and we're stuck paying way more than retail from &#34;unauthorized&#34; vendors who are likely importing a few CPUs from another country or got their hands on some pre-production samples and, either way, are charging a huge premium over the official price.<br /><br />Intel doesn't seem to be favoring their OEMs as the Broadwell desktop &#34;C&#34; processors have also not shown up in any OEM systems I'm aware of from the big players like Dell, Lenovo, HP, etc. And this chip uses the same 14nm process as the Broadwell parts they've been shipping all year for use in laptops and tablets so it's not likely a process problem.<br /><br />I think the *real* problem is Intel was so late releasing this CPU, and it's i5-5765C twin, that it ended up overlapping Skylake (the i5-6600K and i7-6700K) so they've decided it's no longer a priority. Unfortunately, Skylake requires a new socket 1151 motherboard, does not have the impressive Iris Pro graphics this processor does, and has a much higher TDP so it needs a bigger/louder cooler, case, fans, power supply, etc. So it's not really a good replacement for this CPU. And, in any benchmark involving graphics, this processor blows away the newer i7-6700K.<br /><br />At their recent IDF conference nearly all the emphasis was on mobile devices and IoT (Internet of Things), the new Skylake CPUs lack Iris Pro, and they can't seem to even keep their published commitments for releasing desktop processors like this one. Further, the high-end &#34;K-series&#34; 6th generation Skylake CPUs are not much faster than even the now ancient 3rd gen &#34;K&#34; CPUs. Apparently Intel wants us all to just keep our old desktop systems.",12,False
2,Stick with Intel and avoid this board if possible,"This board is disappointing on several levels. First, even with a best-case highly efficient power supply the idle power consumption is about double an Intel Bay Trail fanless board (like the J1800). AMD just doesn't seem to understand power management. The difference between idle and full load power consumption is only a few watts.<br /><br />The heat sink is also marginal. Just sitting idle (no CPU load) in open air, the CPU heats up to 60 C. Inside a case without a fan, it hits 75 C. And under load in a case it overheats. What's the point of a fanless motherboard if it needs a fan? Intel Bay Trail boards stay cool without a fan.<br /><br />Biostar is not in the same league as Asus or Asrock. The BIOS has some poor English, there are limited options, the manual is a single folded page, etc.<br /><br />The performance, despite the higher power consumption and quad cores, isn't much better than a dual core Intel Bay Trail. You don't get twice the speed despite it using twice as much power.<br /><br />The only good news are the standard DDR3 SIM sockets (many fanless mini-ITX boards use laptop memory) and the full size PCIe slot (many fanless boards have  only a PCIe X1 slot or an old-school PCI slot). So, for some applications, this board might still be a good fit.",3,True
5,"Intelligent design, nice touches, almost perfect","This weekend I switched from an SUV to a sports sedan, with a corresponding loss of space. I needed something to combine all the stuff that was rattling around my [[ASIN:B0009N30EQ visor organizer]], on the passenger seat, on the back seat, and between the seats. This bag fits the bill nicely.<br /><br />The key design element is the internal frame that keeps the bag upright and the top open. So if you dump in a pile of miscellaneous papers, the bag stays upright with an open top, allowing you to sort through the papers easily with one hand, without having to remove the papers from the bag.<br /><br />There's a partition for your laptop, which works great. Most of the time, I prefer to carry one of my laptops into meetings without a briefcase. Drop one or two laptops in this bag, then just grab the one you need.<br /><br />There's also a front section designed for phones, GPS units, MP3 players, etc. It has lots of little pouches for business cards and pens. This section eliminated the need for the visor organizer. I always use a [[ASIN:B000WGD13U Fisher Space Pen]]in the car, because other pens tend to stop working in the heat, or fail to write on the surface.<br /><br />The obvious question is, why not just use a briefcase? Easy answer: The open top means you can grab what you need with just one hand, without taking your eyes off the road for more than an instant. My only complaint is that a bag this innovative should have an easy way to clip to the seat belt, or some way to keep it from going flying on a hard stop or fast turn.

5,Intelligent design and quality construction,"I'm very impressed by the attention to detail and the quality of construction.  Every edge and corner is finished perfectly.  The paint job is fantastic.<br /><br />You can see plenty of pics and vids on the Web showing the easy to use drive mounts and the ample size, but until you start building with it, you can't appreciate the thought that went into the case.  For example, the wheels are placed in such a way that when you want to put the case on its side, the wheels don't ""shoot out"" from underneath; instead, the case rocks over into a relatively stable position for gently laying it down.<br /><br />One thing I didn't think about before building the system was how the fan on the side panel would be plugged in when I wanted to open the case.  No problem, it turns out, because here is another nice little touch:  The panel fits into the case in such a way as to act like it has a hinge if you apply a little frontwards pressure on the panel as you open.  In other words, you can swing open the panel enough to unplug the fan, and then you can remove the panel.<br /><br />Or, if you don't mind putting the case down, you can swing up the panel and keep it propped open (like the hood of a car) with a stick.<br /><br />The great benefits of the size of the case are cable management and airflow.  The fixed cables on big power supplies are very thick, but the back panel closed over everything with no problem at all.  On some boxes I have dreaded going back in because the cables are so tightly packed, but this is no issue at all with the HAF X.<br /><br />As for appearances, I think it looks great.  Pics on the Web seem to emphasize the futuristic, military looks and the lighted fans.  But in my office, it just looks like a very well made tower case, not flashy at all.  The window is not only for showing off your build, but for the practical purpose of observing LED indicators on the board.<br /><br />My only suggestions for improvement would be to include rubberized wheels, as the included ones slide more than roll on hard surfaces, and to provide a better instruction booklet for wiring the fans and LED's.<br /><br />Anybody buying computers these days knows that quality is becoming rare, which is sad.  That's one reason I so enthusiastically praise Cooler Master for this product (and the Hyper 212 Plus heatsink that looks so freakin' cool through the window!)",3,True
5,"Macs Great, iMac Unique, and Intel Power","Without question, I love Macintosh computers.  The ease of use, performance, and design that is Apple makes me productive, keeps the headaches down, and makes working on a computer fun.<br /><br />When Steve Jobs announced the new iMac, with Intel Core Duo processors I was almost certain I wanted to buy it.  Why?  Macs are well known for ease of use and capabilities, but they have managed all that for years, with processors that are not always top-notch.<br /><br />Processor in the new iMac<br /><br />The Intel Core Duo processor in the new iMac is an amazing chip. What have I noticed about the speed of the machine featuring this chip?  It is incredibly fast.  You'd be surprised by how much faster even web browsing is, when you have a processor as powerful as the Core Duo.  However, what I've really been impressed by is doing things such as video encoding.  I've encoded videos in H264 as much as eight times faster than my Powerbook G4.  Furthermore, the iLife applications that are included on the iMac fly, with the speed.  iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, and Garageband perform like never before.  I've really been impressed by the speed.<br /><br />The Core Duo is a great processor. It offers exceptional desktop PC performance, in a design that can fit in small computers and notebooks.  It features two cores on a single die, which effectively gives you the performance of two processors.  Don't let the 1.83 GHZ clock speed fool you.  This Core Duo Chip will outperform 3+ GHZ Pentium 4 processors.  It really is an amazing breakthrough, from Intel.<br /><br />Video Card<br /><br />The new iMac features an ATI Radeon X1600 graphics processor using PCI Express<br /><br />128 MB of GDDR3 video memory.  This is the best graphic card Apple has *ever* included with a consumer Macintosh.  This graphic processor will work well for most gaming, and it is great for viewing back complex H264 movies, including high definition videos.  You can enjoy high definition H264 videos, without drop frames.  I couldn't even play these videos, on my Powerbook.<br /><br />Video out - The new iMac, for the first time ever, features a Mini-DVI output.  This allows, with adapters, the ability to connect the iMac to a DVI display, a television via composite or S-video, or an analog display via VGA.  I have my new iMac Core Duo connected to my 20-inch Apple Cinema Display, and it works perfect!  A nice feature.  This allows for screen-spanning, so I can take advantage of both screens.<br /><br />Memory - This iMac is a powerhouse, but it is held back by the standard 512MB of memory.  You can still do a couple tasks at a time, but for intensive tasks and multitasking you need more memory.  Add at least another 512 MB stick, for a total of 1 GB memory, but you might consider adding even more.  The iMac supports up to 2 GB of memory.  It uses PC5300 DDR2 - SODIMM modules.<br /><br />Applications -<br /><br />Apple has removed some of the applications previously bundled, with the iMac.  This includes Appleworks.  Appleworks is no longer included, but if you own a copy, it will run fine on this machine.  Apple does include iLife '06, which has iPhoto, iMovie, iWeb, iDVD, and Garageband.  There is the Safari web browser, some board games, the always useful iCal, AddressBook, iChat, etc.  Overall, I was pleased with the included software.<br /><br />iLife 06 is particularly great.  I love the new full-screen photo editing, photo comparing, etc.  You can now also order calendars and greeting cards made with your photos, direct from Apple, by using the iPhoto software.  iMovie has new themes, which helps make professional-looking home movies, and iDVD now supports widescreen DVDs.  iWeb is a brand-new applications, which makes it easy to create professional quality webpages, quickly. I can't wait to rebuild by site using iWeb.  Apple continues to make it easy to create music, manage your digital images, make movies, and create web sites.<br /><br />A trial (30 day) of iWork '06 is also included, which includes the page layout program Pages, and the presentation program Keynote (which makes presentations that blow away presentations made by rival Powerpoint).<br /><br />Hard Drive -<br /><br />The 17-inch iMac comes with a 160 GB hard drive.  This is going to be sufficient for most people to hold their photographs, music, and movies.  However, some people may need more.  It is also important that you remember to backup your important files to either another external hard drive, or DVDs.  I only point this out because today with great machines like the iMac we're storing more of our great memories on computers than ever before, so make sure you don't lose them, if something happens to your machine.  Apple includes a great backup program called Backup 3, if you subscribe to the .mac service. I use it all the time, and it simple interface helps me keep peace of mind.<br /><br />Superdrive-<br /><br />The optical drive included with the new iMac allows you to watch DVDs, listen to music, burn DVDs, and burn CDs.  You can also burn dual-layer DVDs, which is nice.  It is a slot-loading drive, so the disks slide magically in and out of the computer's right side.  There are no drawers to break off.<br /><br />Front Row Experience - Apple has included a new software title that at this time is only available on the iMac and MacBook Pro. Front Row. Front Row comes with your iMac, and a remote control is also included. Front row allows you to watch and listen to media items, on your computer, from across the room. Click one button on the remote, and bring up Front Row, for quick access to your music, movies, podcasts, DVD, and more. I like this feature, but I wonder how useful it is, since I'm usually sitting right in front of the computer and can just use a mouse, to access this content.<br /><br />PowerPC Applications on Intel Machine<br /><br />If you own a lot of software for Mac, then most of it is probably compiled for PowerPC.  Developers are working hard to make titles run natively on both Intel and PowerPC, but many titles are not yet ready.  However, many titles you can use on an Intel Mac because Apple has included Rosetta, which translates the PowerPC code into something the Intel machine can read.  However, you never see Rosetta for it works quietly in the background and makes running PowerPC applications seamless. Microsoft Office, for example, works perfect under Rosetta.  Intensive applications such as Photoshop will run under Rosetta, but it will be slower until Adobe has an Intel compiled version of Photoshop.  Rosetta does work and if you add memory to your iMac, you may find such application somewhat equal to how it would perform on a 1GHZ PowerPC G4, from my experience.<br /><br />Two titles I use EyeTV and Toast 7 are not yet compiled for Intel, but they run fine on my Intel iMac, under Rosetta.  Again, you don't have to open anything special to use Rosetta.  Your Mac knows when it needs it and uses it.<br /><br />Wireless- The iMac can still connect wirelessly to networks using its included Airport Card.  Furthermore, it features a Bluetooth module to connect wirelessly to devices.<br /><br />Design - This iMac is beautiful, and you notice the quality as soon as you begin to open the box.  It is packaged with care, in beautiful packaging.  The iMac is thin, and the display floats above your desk.  Furthermore, Apple includes a nice keyboard and mighty mouse, which allows for multi-button clicking.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with my iMac Core Duo.  It should perhaps come with more memory standard, but it is a very impressive machine.  It is incredibly fast on Intel-native applications, and it does a very good job running PowerPC applications.  If you're upgrading from a G4 Mac like myself, this machine will seem to fly.  If you're upgrading from a G5 based Mac, it will be faster on native applications, but the increase in performance will be less significant to you.  The Intel machines are the future of Apple, so there is no question this is a good machine, and it is powerful enough to be a good computer, for quite some time.  I'm happy with my purchase, and I look forward to continue exploring it in the coming days.",74,False

4,"I prefer the Intellimouse, but the LX7 makes a great notebook mouse","I use a MS Intellimouse on my desktop.  I bought a second one to use with my laptop, but the transmitter that you plug into the USB port is a big thing, almost the size of the mouse, and has a long cord. I found that so unwieldy that I ended up buying a notebook mouse.  But I didn't like its small size or the lack of extra buttons.<br /><br />Then I bought the LX7 as a replacement for the notebook mouse, and am pretty happy with it.  There is just a small USB dongle, and the mouse itself is about 2/3 the size of the Intellimouse -- exactly what I want when travelling.  Now I can have a good mouse experience when I'm on the road without having to deal with the bulk and the cable of the Intellimouse.<br /><br />Here are some other notes about how the LX7 compares to the Intellimouse:<br /><br /> - I miss the Intellimouse's accelerated scrolling.  That is, I have the Intellimouse set up so that if I flick the scroll wheel quickly, it scrolls very far very fast.  Alas, there is no such setting on the LX7.  I find the LX7's ""universal scroll"" reasonable, so I'm using that - click a button to enable universal scroll and simply move the mouse itself to scroll.  Not as convenient as the Intellimouse, and you use up one of your buttons for it, but its OK.<br /><br /> - I also prefer the fact that the Intellimouse's scroll wheel is clickless.<br /><br /> - The Intellimouse puts the two extra buttons under the thumb, and I prefer that, although clearly the LX7's button placement (and lack of tilt) make the mouse usable with either hand.<br /><br /> - The Intellimouse can be programmed so that the buttons do different things in different programs.  For example, the thumb buttons may be Back and Forward in your browser but Delete and Reply in your mailer.  The LX7 software does not attempt this.  Note, however, that the Microsoft software doesn't seem to make the distinction reliably, such that I end up having to just use the global settings for everything.  It would be a big advantage to Microsoft if it worked well (and maybe it does for others).<br /><br /> - The Intellimouse tracks well on some surfaces that the LX7 can't handle (e.g. a glossy magazine).  Not a big deal, but I have to pay a little more attention to what I put under the LX7.<br /><br /> - One thing I hate about the Intellimouse is that the batteries are hard to extract when it comes time to change them.  With the LX7 you simply pull on a little strip of mylar and the batteries pop out.<br /><br />In short, I prefer the Intellimouse when it is staying put, and the LX7 when I need to haul it around.<br /><br />-- An update --<br /><br />This mouse was dead in something like six months.

5,"Great kit, everything included to do a custom intel CPU loop.","Great kit, comes with all the required parts to make a custom CPU loop. All the cables, fittings, hoses, nuts and bolts. The only thing you would need to add is coolant. This particular one is only for intel chips, so do be careful when ordering. XSPC makes AMD blocks and brackets as well, however this particular one is an intel kit. I'm going to split this review up into it's basic components, and in the end, I will add what exactly I ended up purchasing in order to turn this into a CPU + GPU loop.<br /><br />1. The pump reservoir combo - This kit comes with the D5 pump (arguably the best pump on the market) coupled with a Photon 170mm reservoir, that is already pre-installed on top of the D5 pump, effectively making this into a single unit. These parts can be purchased separately. There isn't much I can say about the pump, if you're water cooling, you will know how good the pump is. It's silent, powerful, and has a 5 way switch on the bottom to control the speed. I have mine set at 2. It's inaudible. The reservoir is a very, very nice unit. Beautifully crafted, well thought out, it is made of real metal and glass. Not plastic and acrylic. This is the real deal. water flows smoothly, without any turbulence, regardless of pump speed. The center column light up with the etched XSPC logo, but it can be rotated if for some reason you don't want to see it.<br /><br />2. 280mm Radiator - The included radiator is the XSPC AX280, it's a very sturdy, well made XSPC radiator, with thick mounting outer shell, with white XSPC logos on either side. One thing that surprised me about this radiator is how clean the internals were straight out of the box. As you may know, you have to flush radiator before you install them, in order to get the excess material (mostly shavings) out before you run it in your system. This radiator was the cleanest one I have ever flushed. My guess is they flush them before packaging. Very pleased, a huge time saving for the end consumer.<br /><br />3. Raystorm CPU block - The included block is the XSPC Raystorm PRO, not the regular V3. It's a very heavy, well machined 3 piece block. Aluminum base, acrylic inserts (for the included LEDs) and a pure copper block. It's a very clean, understated, well made piece, and it comes with all the hardware required to install, including robust motherboard brackets and black screws. One thing to not, if you're new to this is the fact that the block does have a proper direction the water should be flowing, marked on both the outer shell, and the copper block itself. The good thing is, you can actually rotate the copper block 180 degrees to match your preference when installing your tubing, while keeping the top aluminum part facing up. This would have been impossible if the block and outer shell were permanently attached. Very nice overall.<br /><br />4. Fittings - The kit comes with 6 black chrome G1/4 to 7/16 compression fittings. The're well made, dry, and look great. Not much else can be said, other than all of the ones that came with my kit were a perfect fit.<br /><br />5. Hose - The kit comes with a 2 meters of 7/16 clear tubing. It's not too thin and not too thick. Easy to work with, more than enough will be left over to add a GPU to the loop (at least in my case).<br /><br />That's all for the kit itself. If you're planing to add a GPU to the loop, you will need some more parts. In my case, and I stress, my case, I had to get another 4 compression fittings, a GPU block, gpu backplate (both from XSPC) and an extra 120mm radiator. You might not need the extra radiator, but it's a good idea to figure out exactly how much heat dissipation you will need based on the component you will be cooling. The coolant I used is the Thermaltake 1000 red. (1 gallon was enough in my case).<br /><br />I have also attached a couple of pictures of the finished build, thanks for looking.

3,"Great range, and intelligent wireless configuration","Pro:<br />1. Great range, and intelligent wireless configuration.<br />2. Handles multiple devices well.<br /><br />Cons.<br />1. At this point in time, there is no QoS setup. Its an automatic QoS, and its not too bad, but i was severely disappointed that a router that costs this much didn't come with any kind of QoS configuration. After researching it, i found out that the QoS option wont be configurable till the first quarter of this year. So i'll wait and see.<br /><br />2. This router tends to drop devices. My computer upstairs would get disconnected frequently. Very aggravating when playing video games. My moms laptop will also get dropped periodically. And we'll have minor internet outages for everyone, not just a few devices, and it last about 10 seconds. This randomly happens. Again, very aggravating.<br /><br />Is it worth the amount they are asking? I wouldn't say so. If i had the chance to buy it again, i wouldn't. The cons far outweight the pros.

5,Great budget priced mini PC. Intel Celeron J4125 makes this system a winner...,"The OUVISLITE GK3V is also sold as the ACE-PC GK3V and the Terryza GK3V. The GK3V is a full featured but affordable mini PC with the more or less standard, but still amazing, tiny footprint of about 5.25""x 5.25"" x 2"". Despite its tiny size it has two USB 3.0 and two USB 2.0 ports, two HDMI video out ports, a VGA video out port, and an Ethernet port. Although the built in SSD drive is only 128GB there is an easy to access SATA 2.5"" drive bay on top of the unit to which I was easily able to add a SATA SSD. It's not documented but there is also an unused SATA M.2 slot on the motherboard, although to access this slot requires a lot more disassembly than most users would want to get into and may void your warranty if you take the unit apart to get at it.<br /><br />The system comes with 8GB of system memory. But there are no instructions for how to add additional RAM. The HDMI ports support 4k HDMI video. There is dual band 2.4/5GHz WiFi. The system has a tiny cooling fan that hasn't come on much in my use and hasn't been annoying. There's also a VESA mount in the box.<br /><br />But, the best for last, the system comes with an Intel Celeron J4125 CPU. The performance of the Intel Celeron J4125 is substantially better than all past Celeron models. Budget Intel processors have come a long way in recent years. Mostly due to what were once features of top tier chips slowly migrating down the pecking order to become features of the entry level models. Although Celeron systems used to be synonymous with very limited performance the Intel Celeron J4125 is more comparable to recent i3 or older i5 generation chips. It has four cores, supports four threads, has on chip 4K UHD and HEVC video decoding, and a range of other features that were once for ""advanced"" Intel CPUs. Although you might not want to do intensive Photoshop work with this system, or anything other than basic video editing, it is nevertheless more than up to any web browsing, video playing, most games, and the use of products like Office and so forth.<br /><br />So for me this is a great little unit, and the performance and features are certainly compelling and worth looking at for the budget price this unit is offered at on Amazon.",0,False

5,"A great WIFI card using fast, reliable Intel technology","I bought this UBit WiFi 6 card to replace an Intel Centrino Wireless-N card in my desktop and what a difference!  The old card was single band 2.4Ghz and I maxed out around 120Mbs download speed on my home wifi. I have a 600Mbs internet package but I never saw anywhere near that performance because of the limitations of my wifi card. Well that's all changed now.  I've gone 5ghz and I'm never going back.  The 5.1 Bluetooth is also a game changer compared to the BT2.0 dongle I had before.<br /><br />Installation is a breeze.  The kit is nicely packaged and they include everything you need to install the card.  It has the card, a standard and low profile bracket, bracket screws, a USB header cable, drivers on CD, and even a decent little screwdriver.  It took me 15 minutes to open up my pc, swap out the card and get booted back up. One thing about the install, to use the Bluetooth you have to have a free USB header in your computer.  The Bluetooth uses the USB bus to operate so if you don't connect the included USB header cable you won't get Bluetooth. On my Lenovo M93 there was not a free USB header so I disconnected the one that powered the 2 USB2.0 ports on the front of the computer. It also has 2 USB3.0 ports (different header) in front so I won't even miss the ones I disconnected.  You can see the disconnected yellow connector in one of the pictures<br /><br />TIP: If you don't have a cd player (or really even if you do) just go to their website and download the drivers before you start the install, that way it is on your hard drive when you boot back up and you don't have to mess with CDs.  I checked the driver on their website against the one Intel offered and as of when I checked, UBit's website offered the same version as Intel did.<br /><br />Oh the improvement!  I expected better but I did not expect to touch the 600Mbs download speed of my Xfinity package over this wifi connection. I can repeatably hit over 580Mbps on Speedtest and using Google's speed testing utility over multiple test runs. Fantastic.  Bluetooth 5.1 is also a night and day difference over my old 2.0 dongle.  I have a set of BT5 headphones that would skip and stutter pretty bad on the old setup.  That is a thing of the past.  They now work perfectly.<br /><br />I work in Information Technology and with Covid I have been working from home on this computer for months, doing Zoom meetings, calls on my soft phone, remotely connecting to applications and servers, and I feel silly when I have to have to tell people that old technology is causing me grief. I only wish I'd done this upgrade months ago.<br /><br />Not much more to say.  UBit has put out a great card using a great Intel chipset, you should get one.",1,True
5,"A managed, intelligent, business-class switch","This is definitely a smart/intelligent switch that support many of the features that comes with some of the business-class switches. It supports solidly constructed and housed in a metal frame so it can be mounted very easily. It’s also fairly compact for an 8-port switch, given that it is an intelligent switch.<br /><br />Some of the features I was super excited to find are:<br />- Support for 128 port- and tag-based VLANs<br />- Spanning Tree: 802.1d/s/w<br />- Link Aggregation<br />- QoS<br /><br />It has some seriously advanced security features that can be very useful if you want a tightly controlled network. For example, you can set up ACL (Access Control Lists) based on MAC, IPv4 or IPv6 address for each port. When a client device is attached to that port, it won’t be able to connect its MAC or IP is in the list. This can be really useful if you want to attach it to an open jack in an office but want to restrict access to only authorized devices.<br /><br />I think this switch is definitely worth the price if you are buying for the advanced networking features it provides. If you are not buying it for one of these features, you should consider a home/office switch and save money.",0,False
5,It's all about the intelligent design!,"When I first looked at this mouse, I knew that resistance was futile. I was intrigued by the design from the start. I was not sure how comfortable it may be after several uses. So I ended up buying one to be used primarily with my laptop during travel.<br /><br />It is so intelligently designed that it turns itself off when it's in its flat position. This keeps the battery from draining when not in use. It feels comfortable in my hand. I'm writing this review after using this mouse for almost 6 months now. It's always comfortable though after several hours of continuous use, your hand may get more tired than if you were using a truly ergonomic mouse. However, as I mentioned, I use it primarily when I am traveling and it's still far superior to some of the compact laptop mice that I used.<br /><br />Another great thing about this is the ""cool"" factor. People who have never seen this mouse before often ask me about it. I'm glad that the mouse is not white in color otherwise it could be easily assumed that it's an Apple product. Some people still get surprised to see the Microsoft logo on it. But I bought it neither for the cool factor nor the Microsoft logo.

4,"Great for facial motion capture & background replacement, but you may need to get drivers from Intel's site for best results.","I was interested in experimenting with facial motion capture and animation, and went looking for one of the few cameras out there that supported Intel's RealSense depth-sensing standard. The Razer Stargazer was one of about 2 or 3 on the market at the time that I could easily locate.  On the whole, it's a pretty amazing device, if you understand that this is not your regular old vanilla plug-and-play USB webcam. These cameras are essentially providing several different simultaneous image streams with different kinds of data. One is, of course, the visible image stream you'd expect, but one of the others is essentially a mapping of distances to points on your face (or the thing at which it's focused). As a result, the drivers are a little particular, and have not been entirely without issues, as both they, and Windows 10 have matured. In order to get the most out of this, you may need to get the Intel RealSense drivers (a.k.a. the Intel SR300). While Razer Synapse does periodically offer to update the software, it's clear that this product may have always been from some other &#34;side of the house&#34; within Razer. It had its own website, to which the regular Razer site may or may not have ever actually linked to.<br /><br />Now, as to why it's amazing. This camera supports a number of depth-sensing applications out of the box, but the one in which I was most interested was FaceRig. FaceRig will do real-time animation mapping on top of a face in a video stream, and it is a complete hoot and delight to use. There are both basic and advanced modes, and a library of free and inexpensive animated faces that one can use.  It's on Steam now, so it's even easier to get than earlier in its lifecycle.<br /><br />Windows Hello works quite well with this camera. The reason depth-sensing cameras are important for biometric security (like logging in with your face) is that the depth sensor can discriminate between the real you in front of your PC, and someone holding up a printed picture of your face in order to spoof you to get into your computer.  Every so often after I take a big Windows update, the camera won't initially work to log in. Sometimes a simple post-upgrade boot will remedy that, other times, I have occasionally (very occasionally) had to reinstall the driver package (I usually use the most current Intel SR300 drivers) and it all just works after the next boot.<br /><br />Razer's peripheral management software, Synapse, provides a control panel of sorts for verifying that the camera works, and setting some modes for it. Generally, I haven't had to tweak that at all, other than saving a profile or two for particular ways in which I wanted to use it.<br />I don't know whether I'd buy a depth-sensing camera unless I: (1) wanted to use it for facial recognition, or (2) wanted to use it for facial motion capture and background replacement.  For applications other than those, you can probably get by with a less-sophisticated camera, If you're doing those, however, this camera will work, but you may need to get the Intel drivers from Intel. On the whole, it pretty much just works.",1,False

A nice gaming processor for beginners or if you're on a budget.<br /><br />Update: 01-26-23<br /><br />I haven't had my pc not even 6 months and already having issues. During the past month, I start having issues playing Second life (virtual gaming)off and on. My pc keeps freezing and turning colors (like a rainbow) then reboots. Two days ago, I start hearing rattling sounds. I messaged Amazon and AVG so hopefully I will get help with parts for my pc. I'm not an expert when it comes to building a pc. I don't know rather or not it's the graphic card, power supply or fans that's causing the issue. All I know, it doesn't play second life well and it's making lots of rattling loud sounds. Therefore, it's not as quiet as advertised and I am dropping my stars from 5 to 1 until I get a response and new parts for my pc. I only had this desktop since September of 2022 (that's probably a little over four months--not quite five months). Here's a brief video I recorded from my cellular. Sadly, I cannot afford another pc (I'm disabled). If this goes completely out, I've lost cash and a pc!<br /><br />Update: 02-22-23<br /><br />Since then, I shipped the PC back and the seller lied about sending back a replacement. Instead, I got back the same PC. Also, I noticed a broken fan (wing) within the front area of the processor. Again, the seller lied about fixing the PC because I tested it by playing Second Life (VR gaming) and the same issues occurred (static colorful screen, crashing and PC reboots). Yet, the only solution the seller can come up with is sending me another label requesting to fix fan not the defective parts or a replacement. Also, the seller states I cannot get a refund after thirty days. Well, what about my replacement? I had this PC less than 5 months (not quite four). This is not how one should do business with customers.  Look some place else unless you can afford buying parts or another PC. I do not recommend buying a PC from this seller or Amazon. Another life learned lesson I have to swallow. My mistake!!<br /><br />03-01-23<br /><br />I no longer trust Amazon words either due to filing A to Z Claim and it was closed. Email says it was closed due to me withdrawing from a refund---This is a lie!! Anyway, spoke with a representative and she gave some BS statements when questioned about the claimed. Then she said the seller claimed it was fixed and shipped. Say what? When does a customer words mean nothing? Clearly, this company stick certain people with defective parts on their processors to sell and lies about replacing a PC with a replacement PC and or fixing a PC, etc.  I haven't had access to any computer for a month (now coming to a new month). Once I get this PC back I am done with this seller along Amazon although Amazon is not at full fault. Still, there should be someone checking in on customers to see if he or she are happy with their product(s) once a customer file A to Z Claim. If I had the PC for a year then I completely understand ignoring complaints-- Just not when I only had the PC for less than four months (or less). This is a big concern for customers.  Amazon services are not completely acceptable either.",0,True

I have always been happy with Intel products until I experienced this sub par support.",0,True
4,Intelligent Design,"First of all, you should know the current price is closeout pricing. These originally went for $300, and were considered worth that price by reviewers.<br /><br />Whether these IEMS are actually worth $300 is kind of a moot point, as the current price is 1/3rd of that.<br /><br />Second thing you should know is the company went-bottom up, so any support issues past 30 days, you're on your own.<br /><br />Third thing you should know is, these are not basshead IEMS. They have a balanced tuning which emphasizes clarity, texture and detail. The dynamic range can go down to 15khz which is well within the sub-bass region, but the focus is more on accentuated treble. There is bass, but it's crisp and tight and does not drown out the mids.<br /><br />If any of these things are dealbreakers for you, move on.<br /><br />I'm not going to say too much about build quality and packaging as these are both excellent and other online reviewers have covered this extensively. The short of it is build is excellent and you get a nice accessory package including multiple ear tips, three interchangable filters, and a detachable MMCX cable.<br /><br />These are extremely lightweight and comfortable despite the metal build. There are pre-shaped earhooks which provide a comfortable fit. I recommend using the Comply foam tips for the best seal which will also give you the most bass, when combined with the black filter.<br /><br />The high point of these IEMS is the sound quality, which is immersive and comparable, maybe even better, than some over-the-ear designs. The imaging is 3-D with a wide and tall soundstage.  Instrumental sdeparation is above-average, even on complex tracks, these never sound muddy.<br /><br />Upon first listen thesy sound tight and the treble sounds spikey. But after putting on the Comply tips and the black filter and burning them in a bit, they open up nicely, so don't worry about that.<br /><br />I'd describe the sound signature as a mix between fun and technical. These are not neutral reference headphones or bassmonsters.  But they avoid the imprecisions of lower-tier IEMS. The treble can be sparkly but never becomes sibilant.<br /><br />They fit better and more comfortably than other IEMS i own"" the TRN V80, Tin Audio T2, and Echoboox Finder. In terms of comparison, the V80s have more bass but also more sibilance and are less ergonomic in terms of fit, the T2's have a more neutral sound and are notably heavier in weight, meaning more-fatiguing. The Finder is close in terms of sonic signature, but the Nomads are improved in just about every area, and are engineered for more-controlled highs, as well as a much better fit. While these other IEMs cost a fraction of the Nomad's price, the Nomad is the best overall out of these four sets of cans, and easily compete in their current price segment, and maybe even with some more-expensive headphones.<br /><br />Yhe Nomads sound good with a wide variety of genres -- jazz, rock, hip-hop, EDM,  reggae. It takes a little while to get used to their sound presentation, but i found that the level of detail and clarity makes up for any other issue.  Because they have so much detail and a bright, sparkly sound, you dont need to turn these all the way up to get ther most out of them. They are fairly easy to drive at 22ohms impedance , and turning the volume up just makes them louder to the point of uncomfortability. These is a lot of detail at low volumes, so pairing these with a smartphone should be no problem (i tested the Nomads on a Shiit Fulla 2 hooked up to a PC; YMMV depending on sound source and loudness of the source recording).<br /><br />I haven't tested them yet with an EQ to see how they respond. I also haven't tried them on phone calls, so I can't say how well the mic and call quality are.<br /><br />Bottom line: these are solid contenders in a fairly croded mid-fi IEM market. You could probably find a better pair at 2-3x the cost, but I don't know you can find anything better for a cheaper price.  If you've been skimping by on el cheapo IEMs, you should hear a clear difference in sonic character, not to mention the top-notch build/construction/accessories package.<br /><br />There are still a couple of other IEMs I'm interested in checking out -- the Statue IEM1, the Blon BL-03,  the Fiio P9 Pro, and the Tin Audio P1 -- but after copping the Nomads, I'm in no hurry to do so.  These may not be as good as it gets, but they are ""good enough"" for most discerning ears.",3,False

1,Slightly better than Intel CPU or AMD APU Boxed Fan,Not much cooling improvement over those fans supplied by Intel or AMD when you purchase their processors.<br />I wasted $50 on the NH-L12S.

An All-in-One (AIO) water cooler perform much better than the Noctua NH-L12S. Glad I did not get the NH-L9i as that would of been totally worthless. The 120mm fan cost about $20 so I am at a loss of $30. Does not provide enough room or clearance to allow the use of 4 memory modules on the ASUS Maximus V Gene.

5,Intel Core i7-4790K Haswell Quad-Core 4.0GHz,"I purchased this as part of a new desktop build using a Z97 chipset AsRock Extreme6 motherboard in a Corsair case. I picked this particular CPU for its combination of features (performance, power efficient, VT-x) over the AMD FX line (comparable features but not nearly as power efficient), Intel i7-5820K (more cores but lower performance per core), and a few other options. I probably would have been alright saving a few dollars and gone for the standard i7-4790 since I haven't really experimented with overclocking the CPU, but I have that option later if I have the time or inclination later. Paired with a Samsung SSD and 32 gbs of Crucial RAM, it tends to fly on most tasks.<br /><br />One note of warning: I started off using the stock Intel CPU cooler that it came with. I did some 1080p media transcoding using Handbrake and it pushed the CPU temperature up to a very scary 90 degrees Celsius.

I know there was a lot of fanboys and dishonest press rigging their benchmarks to find a way to get Ryzen to run worse, and the sheer extent that they went to (DirectX 9, 1600x900, two core limitation) really turned me onto this chip in the first place. When you use all 12 threads, this isn't just 20% faster than an equivalent Intel chip. It's literally almost two times as fast... for less money. Not a day goes by where I kill an opponent online only to realize that my 1600X was actually responsible, because their flimsy $200 i3 was stuttering and burning out.<br /><br />AMD saw that Bulldozer wasn't as good as the public wanted, so what did they do? They closed their doors, shipped the 8350 to hold people over, and they hired Jim Keller to help build the second coming of the Athlon 64 (which was on top until Intel committed unforgivable crimes against the free market, such as sabotaging their compiler as discovered by Agner Fog, as well as bribing Dell and HP and others to not buy AMD anymore, and AMD almost went bankrupt).<br /><br />Justice has never been so sweet.

4,"HP rebound, Intel improvement","HP Pavillion dv6t Quad Edition.  After abortive attempt by HP to divest its PC business, and some past negative dealings with HP rebates, I decided to update my Toshiba i7-740QM to this HP i7-2760QM.  So after research, I bought one of these to see if the 2nd Gen Intel i-series CPUs really were ""better"".  Bought through HP for quite a bit more money in Nov. 2011.  Specs were very good, but I upgraded (part of the reason it was more expensive) the 5400 rpm hard drive to a 7200 rpm.  Though there was a delay at Customs in Singapore (didn't know they were made in China), and a 6-day delay at Customs in Memphis, I finally got this supposedly improved laptop.  Strike ""supposedly"".  It ran much cooler than the very good Toshi Satellite 665.  Toshi has 8 Gb 1066 RAM, the HP has 8 Gb DDR3 1333 RAM.  Same MS Ultimate OS.  Same Office Home & Business 2010.  Norton 360 v.5.0.  Toshi has a good 500 Mb DDR3 nVidia 330, the HP has a (much) better 2 Gb ATI DDR5.  Beats Audio is much better than the Toshi's ""good"" Harmon-Kardons, though I have yet to hear any laptop speakers get even close to external add-ons.  Both have a 720p HD, which is quite adequate for non-gamer/non-tech graphics (HP with the good, additional Intel 3000 for routine graphics on the CPU).  The Toshi has a multi-DVD, the HP a Blu-Ray ROM/multi-DVD.  The Toshi has 3 USB 2.0 ports, the HP two 3.0 (with charging capability, and on my desktop, an added ""card"" 3.0 runs 3-1/2 to 4 times faster backups and file transfers to 3.0 external drives than the prior 2.0) and 2x2.0 (one 2.0/eSATA).  The Toshi booted in (minutes:seconds) about 1:30, the HP in :45 with Norton 360, Adobe, Office, etc.  Office, Adobe Photoshop Elements 10, and several other programs on the HP came up in just over 1/2 the time as in the Toshi.  The Toshi's 12-cell battery would last about 2 to 2-1/2 hours.  The HP's 9-cell ran for a bit over 4 hours.  The Toshi's black textured plastic barely shows a fingerprint, the HP's dark umber shows them readily.  Both keyboards are similar.  I've worked with computers since 1983, though not a tech person, and have lots of experience as an ""advanced"" novice-level user.  The decision to purchase this model HP has so far (2 months) been a very good one, and I was so pleased at the improvements, I'm ordering a new one, for less cost, through Amazon (even though the new models will be out in a couple of months with the new ""third generation"" i-series CPUs).  I gave this (reviewed) one to my son (an IT professional), who likes it also, replacing a very nice Dell Studio XPS (i5 CPU).  This Amazon-ordered one has only a 5400 rpm hard drive, but I don't need (in my home and travel) the faster one.  Remember, your MS Performance score is determined by the least fast component, which currently (assuming you don't go to an SSD hard drive) is about 5.9 on the 7.6 scale.  The 5400 will score slightly lower than the 7200, but everything else critical to use (CPU, RAM, optical drive, etc.) runs significantly faster, often making up for the slower hard drive.  And where the Toshi ran hot (not burning, but definitely uncomfortable after a short while of use), the HP gets warm, but not hot.  Despite the fingerprints on the dark umber showing (not a performance issue), I found the fingerprint reader to be accurate and helpful (chuckle).  So no miracle here, but a definitely worthwhile upgrade for me, and I saved nearly $400 from HP's website.  The Toshi was very good 2 years ago, this HP is enough better to justify this under-$1,000 purchase.",20,False

The drive comes with a licensed PowerDVD disc installation, so you can use PowerDVD 14 to play your normal 1080p Blurays. I found that I had to upgrade to PowerDVD 19 (purchase a license) to play 4k UHD Blurays. That's bad on the part of the Cyberlink software.<br /><br />Through no fault of the drive maker themselves, UHD 4k Bluray playback won't work unless you have an Intel CPU and motherboard that supports Intel SGX. Chalk this up to Intel and the Hollywood association making it difficult for legitimate purchasers to play their UHD discs on PC.<br /><br />I used a laptop with an Intel i7-8750h and SGX support, and it is able to play 4k UHD Blurays properly with Cyberlink PowerDVD 19 on this Lite-On EB1 drive. Problem is Cyberlink's software sucks, they cap their capability to read discs at 60Mbps, but some 4k UHD Blurays playback at 100Mbps. In basic terms, that means PowerDVD actually hangs momentarily between certain scenes when playing back (tried this with Wonder Woman Bloodlines). You're better off ripping the disc to your computer and playing it back through free video software than using Cyberlink's rubbish.<br /><br />To note, I also have an AMD Ryzen 9 3950x desktop system and 4k Bluray playback is not possible through this drive due to the Intel SGX requirement.<br /><br />Normal Blurays will playback without issue on both Intel and AMD CPUs with this drive, regardless of SGX capability.<br /><br />Overall the drive itself is solid except for the slightly loose USB 3 cable port.

I will leave the tech specs as they have been covered extensively here. I am a power user of Google now on my phone. Let me start by saying, echo is not even 20% of what you can do with Google now when it comes to search. It mostly interprets the sentences wrong and only gets it right about 4/10. The intelligence is really low. You have to say specific terms for it to understand at times. The services offered are themselves limited. No traffic information unless you specify your start and destination in Alexa app. Only music you can listen to is from Amazon store. The list goes on. Compared to how Google can search all over web and understands what you say almost always, this seems more like a novelty toy and not a seriously reliable assistant. Most skills really depend on how good the skills are programmed and most of them seem like half baked hasty releases. For the price it is good compared to google home but it's unreliability to understand and limited services offered makes this a novelty, not a serious buy. If Google slashes it's price in future or comes up with a cheaper no speaker version like dot, echo will have a hard time competing. I am hoping they update and improve their software soon.",4,True
5,Works with my Intel SR300 webcam with Windows Hello,"I had a doozy of a time trying to get my Razer Stargazer webcam to work consistently with Windows Hello:  Windows 10 would frequently drop recognition of the camera after major updates.  The camera's gut is actually an Intel SR300 Real Sense camera, and its actually a problem reported by multiple users and known by Intel and Microsoft.<br /><br />After the last WIndows 10 update, I could not get my computer to re-recognize my webcam at all as a Windows Hello compatible camera.<br /><br />I purchased this PCIE USB 3.0 adapter on a hunch that it might be because of the built-in USB chip on my motherboard.  I think I was correct as Windows 10 recognized my Razer Stargazer (Intel  SR300) webcam as a Windows Hello camera after I installed the adapter and installed the Inateck drivers (downloaded from Inateck's website).  The Intel SR300 has a history of not working well if it doesn't get enough power from the USB 3.0 port.  This adapter has a power connection to provide it with additional power via a SATA power port.  It's working well so far after a couple of weeks of use in my Windows 10 workstation with my Intel SR300 Real Sense camera.",0,True

3,Fans will rattle in time. Insufficient for Intel 13th gen.,"Being lured by positive reviews of this product I purchased one and quickly learn two things.<br /><br />1. This cooler is absolutely insufficient for cooling latest 13th generation Intel CPU i9 13900. Unless you have processor limit set which is default the cooler will do the job. But as soon as you unleash the full power of CPU it's temperature it's 100 c and the maximum thermal limit kicks in. It's like the cooler is not there. Who wants to spend premium for fast Intel CPU and then run it throttled down because of insufficient cooler?<br /><br />2. But the worst part is how fragile included fans are. After just couple of hours of use I noticed one of the fans start rattling when brought up to maximum speed by the motherboard. The root cause of this noise was one of fan fins becoming loose. After careful inspection I discovered apparently those find have small base at the bottom making them super fragile. If your motherboard runs them too fast for too long or if you accidentally touch the fan while spinning it will bend the fin irreversibly causing it to rattle forever. Simply speaking fans included with LT270 are junk and needs to be replaced to Noctua for example.<br /><br />Overall this product is way overrated by people who don't know how to use their hardwareat its full potential. Looks to me like a big bait to buy this product is a piece of cheap transparent plastic with a smart backlight that makes lot's of people excited about calling it Infinity mirror, lol. Product great for the noobs. Not recommended for serious users neither overclockers.",3,True
4,No boot w/4x DDR5 sticks on Intel 12th gen i9 MB,"This is not first DDR from this brand I got, very happy with DDR4 modules.<br /><br />However, this time wanted top off RAM on DDR5 motherboard (z690 Aorus Master) with four DDR5 sticks 32GB each and found the motherboard won't boot with all four memory slots occupied.

5,Runs great with Intel 12700K + RTX 3080 OC 12GB,"I had gone for the much praised Corsair RM 850x.<br />But I ran into the terrible cables.  They are impossible to route well as they have 1.5 to 2 inches of rigid area at each end.  It turns out Corsair imbeds capacitors in cables at the 850 level.a<br /><br />So I did research. The EVGA G6 is not only a tiny bit smaller, but in Tom's Hardware if you dig into the numbers. This matches up well in almost all cases to the Corsair.<br /><br />When I opened it I was so happy.  It has cables for all its plugs.  It includes 2 single end PCIe cables no mostly useless pigtails as you really don't want to put a highpower GPU on single cable. If you need a split cable they have two of those.<br /><br />They include a fabric bag to keep spare cables.  Its just a powersupply, but its in the same quality cloth protector my gamming case came in.<br />And a real manual.<br /><br />Its almost like they want us to know they like us being customers.<br /><br />I ran Assasins Creed Origins at max settings on 4K. GPU running at 97% to 100%. for an hour.<br /><br />The MB cable was almost too short for my case and routing.  But the rest had plenty of length for good routing.<br /><br />Now I will always research EVGA first and take review praise for Corsair with a grain of salt.",2,True

4,Probably the best currently available option for Intell 771 series processors.,"I have two personal servers that are built on Supermicro (X7DCA-L) motherboards.  Both are installed in Coolermaster cases, and run Intel Xeon 5405 processors (dual procs on each board).  Until I bought these coolers, the processors were all running the stock Intel heat sinks and fans.  These servers are old, but they're equipped with 24GB of RAM, and RAID 5, and dual quad core processors, so they're still plenty strong for my use.  I have spare processors, motherboards, and RAM, so I'm prepared to keep them running for a long time to come.<br /><br />This all worked great, but the intel fans howl like a truck full of wounded monkeys.  So, with two in each server, and two servers, the noise was significant.  It didn't matter too much until I decided to move my office into the room where these servers are located. At that point, I had to do something, but there aren't a lot of options for CPU coolers for 771 series processors.  I ordered the first one for testing purposes via another vendor.  after receiving it and seeing that it worked pretty well, I ordered the rest via Amazon.  Oddly, the Amazon vendor I purchased them from simply bought them from the other vendor that shall remain nameless, and had them drop shipped to me.  When I got home, I found a box from the other vendor sitting on my doorstop, and it took a minute to dawn on me what they actually did.  But I digress....<br /><br />Just adding these coolers in place of the stock intel coolers made a huge difference.  But for further noise reduction, I replaced the 80mm fans that came with these units with Noctua NF-A8 fans (also purchased via Amazon).  The original noise claim for these coolers was 24db, but the Noctua fans are 17.7 db, so if low noise is your goal, it's definitely worth doing!  But now my dual processor servers are as quiet as my workstation.<br /><br />Anyway, I took a star off because the fan that comes with these sinks could be quieter.  But it's a standard 80mm fan, so you can replace it easy enough.  The coolers fit my supermicro boards perfectly, but you need to have a backing plate behind the motherboard if you're not using a supermicro case.  The backing plate is also available from Amazon.<br /><br />The cases I'm using are regular tower cases.  They are plenty deep enough to accommodate these fans/sinks.",3,True

5,Wow!  We're 20C cooler compared to stock Intel CPU fan,"The build:<br /><br />Asus P8Z77-V ATX board<br />Intel i5-3570K overclocked to about 4.18 Ghz<br />Gigabyte mid-tower (sorry, don't know the model number)<br />Using on-board iGPU graphics<br />Two fans on the radiator in a push-pull config<br /><br />First off, after reading the reviews here I noticed somebody has an Asus P8Z77 board and claimed the capacitors around the periphery of the CPU were in the way of the mounting base for the pump (topside of the board.)  I'm not sure exactly what model Asus board he has, but I encountered no such clearance issues.<br /><br />As other have mentioned, installation took a little thought and the pictograms in the little instruction booklet leave something to be desired, however, if you take it slowly and think the install through, it really isn't that difficult.<br /><br />The primary install issue I had was the Intel radiator was smack dab against the 500 watt Ocz power supply and it was not going to fit against the chassis.  I thought I was in deep doo-doo and couldn't make the cooler fit in the Gigabyte case but fortunately I discovered that the radiator would barely fit if I installed it on top of the existing chassis fan.  I then installed the included Intel fan on the inboard side of the radiator so I now have a push-pull installation.<br /><br />The Intel fan/pump plugs into the CPU fan header and I plugged the other radiator fan into the CPU optional fan header.<br /><br />Performance:<br /><br />With the stock Intel CPU fan:  When applying a special effect to two minutes of HD video in Corel VideoStudio 4, my CPU temperature hit 70C several times.  With the Intel Thermal Solution the *highest* I saw the CPU temp spike to was 50C - a full 20C cooler.  Wow.  Usually the CPU temps would run around 48C while processing the video.  I never noticed my idle temperature with the old fan but we now idle around 32C with the inboard fan running at 880 RPM and the outboard fan at 1200 RPM.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br /><br />The fan and the pump are extremely quiet in normal operation.  When my Asus fan utility (FAN Expert II) spun the inboard radiator fan to full speed (to learn its upper and lower RPM range,) it was pretty loud but I doubt it will ever run that fast.<br /><br />So far I'm extremely pleased with my purchase and recommend it to others.",0,True

I previously had a 2020 16"" intel based MacBook Pro for work configured with two HP monitors. No issues with the monitors and connected instantly with zero effort to get the screens to work with the laptop. Bought this one and connected to my Belkin hub for the HDMIs. Would only connect a single monitor. Googled the issue and found that the new M1 apple chip only supports a single monitor. News to me and I guess I should have researched more. However the low rating stems from the fact that this is a PRO laptop. A professional would want two monitors and should not have to google whether a PRO laptop supports more than 1 monitor when the intel version does seamlessly. Despite this I had planned to keep it and just deal with 1 monitor because of the cost savings over buying the Intel based MacBook Pro and wanted the longer battery life. Now brings me to the issue that made me return the laptop. This laptop just would not configure to show a clear resolution with my monitors. The scale was off and the display just stayed blurry no matter what setting I changed it to on the monitor or the laptop's settings. Tried and tried and just gave up. Returned this and ordered an Intel based 13"" MacBook Pro. No issues, supports dual monitors, and seamlessly integrated to the laptop.

5,A surprising budget powerhouse from Intel,"Please note that as I write this - March 2017 - this CPU is not in-stock through Amazon and third-party sellers are pricing well above MSRP. You should be buying this for no more than $60-$65 and may be able to find it a few bucks cheaper. My review is based on that price point.<br /><br />While Intel's CPU releases are typically driven by excitement at the high-end, in the case of the 7th-gen release of Kaby Lake, there's not much to get excited about; performance improvements mostly are due to small clock speed increases compared to 6th gen plus built-in support for 4K video playback for sites like Netflix. However, near the bottom of the desktop product stack is the Pentium G4560, a $60 dual core hyper-threaded CPU that offers nearly the same performance as the i3-6100 at half the price. Why is this so exciting?<br /><br />It may not be a true quad-core, but for $60, you're getting a modern CPU that has very good performance in basic computing tasks, but also one that can run modern AAA gaming titles when paired with a quality discrete GPU. If your goal is to run AAA titles at 60 FPS, this CPU paired with an RX 470 (or 480 if you want a little more future headroom) is about the best deal I've seen in PC gaming the past 5 years. I personally picked up my CPU for $55 using a $5 eBay coupon and got an RX 480 4GB for $140 after MIR from a competitor site. For under $200 combined for the GPU and CPU, I got performance roughly equivalent to what an i3-4150 with a GTX970 provides, and those would've set you back nearly $450 a couple years ago! You can see my 3DMark Firestrike score in the photos, which shows this PC beating 58% of other tested computers. That's amazing for a machine that cost $500. For the curious, this set-up can hold steady 60 FPS at High or Ultra on most titles, including Battlefield 1, Dishonored 2, and Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Note that the CPU hits its bottleneck before an RX480 or GTX1060 will, so it isn't worth pairing this CPU with anything more powerful than one of those. The RX470 is actually the most equivalent and appropriate GPU, but with 480 prices so low, it may be worth picking up one of those instead.<br /><br />If you're building a computer for basic computing tasks, this is an excellent choice. It offers more than enough muscle to multi-task, whether that means spotify plus MS office, leaving a ton of Chrome tasks open while watching YouTube, or multiple Excel workbooks. If you're building a budget Gaming PC, this is a perfect entry point CPU. It allows you to pick up a motherboard with a full range of features, and upgrade later to a 6th or 7th gen i5 or i7 if you choose to do so.",33,False
5,2nd Time's the Charm for Intel,"Last year's Intel Compute Stick was significantly hyped, but unfortunately it suffered from two major flaws. First, it had unreliable and slow WiFi, as well as issues with conflicts between multiple devices over Bluetooth. Second, it had only one USB port. Both of these issues could be resolved by buying an Ethernet / USB hub, but that defeats the purpose of a tiny stick PC that hides behind a TV or Monitor.<br /><br />For 2016, Intel has upgraded this device's issues, making it a significantly better purchase. The WiFi is now dual-band 802.11ac and it is VERY fast. I pulled over 80 Mb/second over WiFi, which is about my max speed from my ISP even over Ethernet. Intel also has added a second USB port, so there is now one 3.0 and one 2.0. They still include an HDMI extender and alternative power adapters as well.<br /><br />This year's model also has the slightly upgraded &#34;Cherry Trail&#34; Atom x5-Z8300 processor, which has improved graphics capability over the prior year's Atom 3735F &#34;Bay Trail&#34; processor. It can't handle AAA gaming, but it does a great job with Windows Store games like Halo: Spartan Strike and Hitman: GO, as well as Indie games on Steam like Nuclear Throne and Axiom Verge. The WiFi is capable of handling Steam streaming and XBox One streaming, as well. It also has no problem handling 1080p video via YouTube and Netflix, with no skipped frames.<br /><br />It isn't perfect, though; I'm disappointed to still see only 2GB of RAM, which gets used up pretty quickly when using Chrome as your browser, or more advanced MS Office functions. And, 32GB of local storage is still going to get cramped pretty quickly, minimizing your actual local space for application installs.<br /><br />All that said, for $149, this is a solid device that addresses the main problems with last year's model.

5,Intelligently designed; Easy to install,"This kit makes it easy to quickly mount a tablet on a wall. Because it involves two independent mounting clips, you can adjust the spacing of the clips to precisely fit your device. The really clever feature is the different sized sets of rubber spacers that make this kit work with thin displays like an iPad air (ca. 6mm) up to a chunky 13mm older style smart phone. Stick on the right sized set of spacers, and the mounting clips will securely hold your device, thick or thin. The mounting clips are also designed to hide the removal flap for the included 3M Command strips, or to be used with mounting screws if you want a more permanent installation. The mounting clips also provide ample space to feed in and secure the power cord for your device. The end result is a wall mounted display that is neat in appearance as well as secure with no wobbles.",1,True

5,Great Thunderbolt 3 / USB C Dock for Spectre x360 13 10th Gen Intel,"I bought this dock for my new HP Spectre x360 13 10th Gen Intel<br /><br />Laptop specs: Core i7 (10th gen),  4K Oled,16 GB Ram, 1tb SSD with 32gb Octane.<br />Laptop comes with 65 watt charger.<br /><br />I mainly bought this for charging the laptop and using external monitor with one thunderbolt 3 cable.<br /><br />I was initially hesitant to buy the product from CalDigit as I have read some reviews and reddit people complaining about Caldigit product not working correctly with HP Spectre line of laptops. Even on CalDigit Support site, it mentions about this issue without much details. People mostly complained about not able charge or external monitor not working properly. It may have to do with power delivery requirement for certain older and current gen HP Spectre laptops with more than 100 watt power delivery power requirement.<br /><br />I would like to report that the Cal Digit Dock is working perfectly working for the latest Spectre(late 2019) laptop.<br />I am currently using it with one external monitor, and for charging with one cable. My cable is tb3 40gbps rated cable from plugin.<br /><br />I can close the lid to use the external monitor only with external keyboard and mouse.<br />I can also wake the computer up with the mouse or keyboard with the lid closed with the external monitor connected.<br />I also haven't got the system message to use HP's charging adapter.<br /><br />I am glad I did not spend additional 80 dollars for CalDigit TS3 Plus because I do not need more ports then what is provided by the pro unit.<br /><br />As for their tech support, not very helpful. I called their tech support to see if this unit will work with Spectre laptop before purchasing it on amazon. Their answer was simply it may work but they are not sure and asked me to call HP.<br /><br />Overall this is a 5 star product.<br /><br />Update 1<br /><br />When you notebook is off or sleeping. back USB ports are not active and will not be able charge your devices. However, front USB port continue to work charging devices.<br /><br />Update 2<br /><br />I got another monitor and tried connecting two external monitors. One of the monitor would not connect as mentioned in some of the reviews on amazon and Reddit particularly certain brand of laptops specifically HP (I have HP Spectre x360 late 2019 model). After long hours of trouble shooting swapping video cables. I tried my old MacBook Pro 2016 model which is suppose to work with this dock. To my surprise, it showed same exact issue.<br /><br />As it turns out the the tb3 cable between the dock and the laptop can not be too long. I was using a longer cable for flexibility. I swapped out the cable for the original shorter caldigit tb3 cable. Problem was instantly fixed. 4K 60hz internal oled monitor, external 4k 60hz monitor and 3440x1440 60hz monitor.<br /><br />For those who maybe having problems. Check your tb3 cable.<br /><br />Another note: HDR does not work through this dock.",3,True

5,"Working well, but does not support 13th Gen Intel cpu's out of the box.","Looked like the motherboard was totally dead on arrival. I paired this motherboard with a new Core i5 13600KF and PC 3600 DDR4 ram. The reality of it is 12 gen cpu's are supported, but for 13th gen a bios flash is required. This is usually impossible to do, however this motherboard comes with flash back option. Flash back allows you to flash the bios without cpu or ram! Problem is documentation is not great and it took me an hour to figure it out.<br /><br />If you use a 12th gen cpu, then you should be good to go out of the box. For 13th gen you could use a 12 gen cpu, then flash and swap out cpu to 13th gen, or use Flash Back.<br /><br />To use flash back, format memory stick with fat 32, copy across only the bios file, nothing else and rename it Gigabyte.bin . Put the memory stick in the red flash usb port on the rear IO. Make sure that all power connections to the motherboard are in place and press the Flash back button on the motherboard once.

4,Bright Cool White LED Motion Sensor Light with an Intelligent Mounting Solution,"I have a walk-in pantry under my stairwell that has no wired lighting, so over the years I've tried a few different solutions to provide some light back in there. Up until now, I've been using LED lights which turn on/off when you touch them, but replacing the batteries has been a bit of a hassle because for some of them, you can't access the battery compartment without tearing them off of the wall, and if you forget to turn them off once you're done, they will be dead before a day is over. So suffice to say: I've been looking into better options, and this motion sensor light was a great solution.<br /><br />This rechargeable motion sensor light has 10 cool white LEDS, and it's around 8.3 x 0.5 x 1.9 inches in size. The motion sensor looks to be the small circular bit in the center of the light. The package comes with the light as well as a short USB cable for charging as well as some instructions. The light charges via a small USB attachment on one end of the light, and on the other side, there is an on/off switch.<br /><br />Easily one of the features I most appreciate about this light is that the manufacturer considered the fact that it would need to be taken down occasionally to charge, and so their solution was to make it so that the reverse side of the light has a magnetic bar that runs across the reverse side. This magnetic bar easily secures the light, and on the back side of it, there is a strip of pre-attached 3M padded tape. So all you need to do is peel off the sticker, then stick the light wherever you'd like it. When you need to recharge the light, you can just pull the light free from the magnet, and the magnet felt quite secure in my experience.<br /><br />Once you turn the switch to on, it triggers the light to begin trying to sense movement, and if it does, the light will come on. If it stops sensing movement, it will turn off after 15 seconds. It's quite bright and easily illuminates the pantry under my stairwell, but it doesn't necessarily turn on from me walking into the pantry 100% of the time. Sometimes I need to wave my hand near the unit to get it to turn on, and that's why I &quot;like&quot; it rather than &quot;love&quot; it. Even so, it's heads and tails above my previous lighting solution, and I will gladly take having to wave my hand near a bright and rechargeable light every now and then as opposed to the manual touch on/off ones I was previously using.<br /><br />When all said and done, I would still recommend this motion sensor light. Just keep in mind that it's not necessarily susceptible to fine movement, so I wouldn't use it in place of a formal security motion sensor light, but if you simply need a bit of extra light in a particular nook or cranny, it should do just fine.<br /><br />I am a longtime Amazon Prime customer who enjoys writing reviews in my free time. I was appreciative to be given an opportunity to test and review this motion sensor light at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.

At stock clocks, the 3600 is 35% faster in single core and 31% faster in multi threaded.<br /><br />My only complaint is the significantly increased heat over Gen1.  My 1600 would run at 1.18v at stock and 1.28v with all cores at 3.8 GHz.  The 3600 boosts to over 1.41v constantly.  This causes significantly more heat.

The company that sold it to me were supposed to send a sheet with it indicating what memory would work but somehow it wasn't included with my packaging (I got the BLKDP43BF).. They finally did send it (It just gives compatible memory with nominal speed like 1066, not the 1333 or better that I was hoping to use. By the way, even the Intel site has some misleading information on it concerning compatible memory.. Anyway, a big mess! It's sits in the box now .. I doubt if I'll ever use it for anything. Just a waste of time and money. I know how hard it is to find a LGA775 motherboard nowadays, but save yourself some misery and find something else.",0,True

This particular set was the first time I realized that the PC views the display devices as virtual screens instead of actual screens and because of that, you can't use the screens to view protected content per the manual.<br /><br />After I finished the installation, which included an assumption on my behalf, that I needed to connect USB-C power cable to a power source, a USB-C cable to my PC, THEN I could plug in all the other items as needed. The problem is that after I performed the installation, the display would ""reset"" itself after about 10 seconds, and I would need to wait for fo the monitors to register again. Quite annoying after the first 2 times. I tried different troubleshooting techniques, including checking the Displaylink knowledgebase but I was not able to figure it out.

5,Used to add USB 3 to vintage Intel NUC tiny PC,"I have an I3 based Intel NUC (BOXDC3217IYE)  tiny server I bought on Amazon all the way back in 2013 as your  basic home server.  It has stood me well for a variety of home uses over the years and has been a reliable and power-efficient little guy that has been running 24x7 for 7 years as a media server (WMC, now Emby)  and backup device among other functions.  But it only has USB 2 ports and all of the external drives currently attached to it are USB 3, and I wanted an improvement in disk performance - those drives don't ever do better than about 30MB/s on sequential reads and writes on USB 2.  With Emby, if I'm recording 3 TV shows at once that speed doesn't cut it - WMC needed less performance from a drive.  Well this little part is the answer.<br /><br />My NUC has a tiny half-size mini PCI-E slot under the mSATA slot that was intended for a WiFi card and this neatly slid into it (after breaking off the end - it is designed so you can do that) while still allowing room for the mSATA.  I then had to cut a hole in the NUC chassis to run the ribbon cable outside where I could externally connect a USB 3 adapter in the 1X slot.  (I used this one: https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07SRT4PLL)<br /><br />To make this work I did need external power - this device comes with a 4 pin molex cable - I cut off the molex (power supply) end and then wired the yellow wire (+12V) and the black ground wire to a 12V wall wart power adapter I had laying around - I have quite a wall-wart power adapter collection.  (I didn't need the red +5V connector - that is for the USB 2 adapter this card also includes and that I wasn't going to use)<br /><br />And Voila!  Windows 10 saw the USB 3.0 SuperSpeed adapter on boot.  Sequential reads/writes on the exact same drives improved by well over 300%.<br /><br />I admit that physically this isn't pretty and I may figure out an enclosure solution down the road, but it certainly added life to a server that in every other way was adequate to my needs and was a cheap way to do so.<br /><br />Color me pleased.",1,True

2,"Good Performance, Low intelligence","Toshiba did a decent job of providing a good DAC for their video and digital audio options for excellent sound. However, it lacks the intelligence that I think should be standard for a device like this. For instance, it does not seem to have continuous play (or at least I can't find a way to enable it). When playing CDs, it stops after each disc and you have to manually tell it to play the next one. duh. So, you press the &quot;Skip Disc&quot; button on the remote and it goes to the next disc (somewhat slowly) and then stops again. duh. You then have to press play to get it to go. Repeat the above after each CD. It's smart enough to know that it's a CD and not a DVD, but not smart enough to know that you want it to keep going. The only way I could find around this is to do a Program play and specify each disc. This is a pain to do every time I want to just dump 5 CDs in, press play and have music for ~4 hours. My current CD changer which is 5 years old can do this, why can't the SD2805?<br />From what I can tell after running it through the ringer for three days, it plays DVDs quite well.

5,A Marked Improvement Over Intel MacBooks,"I primarily use my MacBook Pro for music production and performance. As such, Logic Pro and myriad amp models/plugins are constantly in use on my machine.

1,No reliable. Manual Unintelligible. Do NOT Buy.,"Glad I tested. If I had relied on this POS, I would be screwed. I had four computers and a router plugged into it. First, it started beeping presumably to indicate that the voltage sensitivity setting was causing it to transfer to battery (supposedly to protect sensitive equipment). So, after spending hours pouring over the unintelligible manual I finally figured out on my own how to change that setting to least sensitive. However, it continued to stay at the previous setting no matter what I did. Next, it started a continuous tone. This is supposed to indicate an overload condition. But it does it with nothing plugged into it as well. The unit provided no battery backup to power critical components in this overload condition. And no warning that it was not going to save your a$$. In summary, the unit constantly set off alarms on voltage sensitivity adjustment even though I set it to the lowest setting. The manual is difficult to read. The manual doesn't tell you how to actually change the voltage sensitivity adjustment. I wasted hours reading the manual and testing.

It does a much better job than the stock cooler by about 10C when I'm encoding videos that max all the cores. Excellent! But a couple of issues keep me from giving it 5 stars. First I had to remove the motherboard to install since the retaining clip mounts on the backside of the motherboard - that was a pain plus keeping the cooler secure/flat with the board upside down wasn't easy. I understand the backside mount is probably needed to account for the low profile yet large cooling area. The second issue may not be only the cooler's fault but fan speed-up wasn't happening normally as cpu temp rose. With the stock cooler the bios setting for various fan speedup curves worked fine but with the new cooler it only speeds up at the most extreme cooling setting. At that setting when the cpu hits 65C it starts speeding up and by 68C its maxed (900-2300rpm). I might getting a different low-profile fan. Otherwise recommended!,0,True
4,A good motherboard for 10th Gen Intel Processors,"I finally updated my PC with this motherboard and a Core i7 processor.  I use this mostly for telecommuting, so it is more than I need, but I'll probably keep this configuration for 8 - 10 years - it gives me flexibility for technology changes that are sure to come.<br />I did find that the CPU power cables are difficult to plug in if the CPU cooler is in place.<br />I would have liked one more USB 2.0 header, but I was able to set it up with 4 front-panel USB ports.  I'm not using the more modern (3.2) USB connector yet, so that gives me some room to expand in the future.<br />I could have used a bit more space for the Power LED connector - the one for my old case takes the room for 3 pins, but this motherboard only provides space for 2 pins.  A trip to my junk box and a few minutes with the soldering iron resulted in a cable that is working well.  A newer case probably wouldn't have this issue.<br />My biggest issue isn't MSI's fault - I wanted to use a motherboard video port for one monitor - I found in MSI's FAQ that the current Intel chipset doesn't permit the use of both a video card (or cards) and the use of the on-board video.  I wish this was something I had seen in the Amazon description ...<br />My current setup uses 2 MSI video cards, plus a USB adapter for my 3rd monitor.  I can probably drive that monitor from another port on one of the video cards - I just need a few minutes to reconfigure things (again!).<br />Overall, I'm glad I got this motherboard - it keeps things so cool that my fans are barely running, so the system is very quiet.  Installation of Win-10 Pro was easy, as was the installation of MSI's drivers and utilities.

4,If you want to run a mini computer like an Intel Nuc the usb power from the NUC ...,I do not write many reviews but since the subject I am about to talk about is no where online I feel I should help out some folks with issue they may run into.

GeChic was super fast to respond to my question about my screen freezing but they do not seem to realize that their 5v 2a charger is not sold in the US. You will have to buy another brand.

5,HONEST REVIEW/COMPARISON FOR ALL INTELLIGENT LIFE FORMS.,"This is an honest review and comparison of the new 4th Generation Echo (not Dot) vs. the 2nd Generation Echo Plus (the last Echo Plus that was launched with the 3td Generation Echo).<br /><br />I actually purchased two 4th Gen Echoes to create a Home Theater Group with the FireTV Stick 4k latest variant. I'll include notes about that as well.<br /><br />Sound Quality Pros: I really enjoy music from different genres and I like to tinker with equalizer settings so that I get the fullest sound out of even a cheap speaker. I also like when a speaker(s) can pull double duty as a surround sound system for my television as well. That's what attracted me to the new Echoes.<br /><br />Regarding music streaming from Amazon Music HD, I must say the sound is really smooth and crisp. I adjusted the equalizer settings for the individual devices in the Alexa app to boost the mid most, followed closely by the treble and a moderate bass setting (if they are paired in a stereo pair or Home Theater, adjusting one device automatically adjusts the other). I have my Echoes placed about 12 feet away in front of  my primary seating spot on the sofa and the are spaced about 8 feet apart flanking the television. They are situated about 4 feet off the ground on book shelves.  This positioning has been perfect for the accoustics in my 15x18 living room with tall ceilings. The speakers really fill up the space. And I am most impressed with how the sound bounces off of the walls and truly feel as if it surrounds me and immerses my eardrums into it.<br /><br />This holds even more true for when I watch a movie with the Dolby Atmos setting on. I can hear the channels fairly well and it really seems like I own my own private movie theater in my living room. There's been times that there's a sound affect so specific to one channel and reproduced so clearly that I've actually muted the show thinking that I was hearing some noise from outside or in the hallway of my apartment building.<br /><br />These two devices together get pretty loud without any noticeable distortion. Now I haven't played much bass heavy music but I do love action and sci-fi movies that are sound effect laden and peppered with bass booming explosions etc. The new 4th Gen Echoes keep up very nicely.<br /><br />In contrast, though I thought I really loved the Echo Plus 2nd Gen, I now find that I really can't enjoy music or movies as much on it. I think that this is because the main speaker fires downward and the rest of the sound is omni directional. This sounds good on paper but in practice, at least for my uses, that type of speaker just seems muffled and really a waste of sound waves. Let me explain. How often to you place the Echo device in the center of a room to benefit from an omni-directional speaker? Most people don't have floor outlets under their coffee tables so it sits on an end table or bookshelf. It's usual home in a bedroom is on the end table. Even in a kitchen, unless placed on the island, the Echo rests with it's back to a wall. So, why then, would you want (let's say) 40% of the sound waves to be directed to a big slab with no ears to appreciate it?<br /><br />The directional sound setup of the new Echo 4th Gen is ideal, really, for it's positioning in most homes. Sound is really diminished if you are behind it or immediately to it's side but comes barrelling at your ear drums when you are any angle in front of it. It's louder, more clear, and much more advanced when it comes to being able to utilize Dolby Atmos playback. I definitely choose the 4th gen over the 2nd Gen Plus any day. I almost feel bad for unloading the Plus onto my parents when I bought the 4th Gen. I'll upgrade them this Christmas. Lol.<br /><br />The omni-directional speaker would be a benefit if it were placed in the center of a patio for a gathering or party, but again, where's your outlets? Not in the middle of the concrete or deck floor. So chances are, even on the patio, it will be placed backing up to an exterior wall. So the myth of the omni-directional speaker advantage is busted in my book.<br /><br />Voice Recognition:<br />At first, I felt there was a noticeable difference with the Plus having the upper hand when I comes to summoning Alexa. However, I believe there have been some fairly large software updates recently that included fine tuning adjustments to the mics on the 4th Gen devices. They now clearly pick up my questions or commands from across the room and quickly cancel out the other Echo Dot I have on the far side open floor plan nearest the kitchen. Before, with the Plus, it was a toss up as to which one would respond because I firmly believe the best mics are still on the Echo Dot 3rd Gen with clock variant. Hands down. If only the echo show 5 in my bedroom would be even half as good, I'd be happy ( that unit is by far the worst with just 2 lack luster mics vs the 4 on the Dot and Plus).<br /><br />Alexa is also quicker to respond on the 4th Gen too. Now that's a combination of the 450-ish gbps internet speed I am fortunate enough to have but I understand it's also due to a better processor and improved software.<br /><br />And let me just say one thing... I don't know anyone who buys their smart home devices with  Zigbee compatibility being the #1 consideration.  Who cares? I have bought the best reviewed for the price smart bulbs, TV, and plugs etc not giving a thought to Zigbee because the latest generation smart devices don't require a hub.<br /><br />All of my smart home devices work just fine by enabling the skill on the Alexa app with that of the manufacturer's chosen app and linking the accounts. The biggest issue I have is trying to remember what I named each lamp and group to turn on and off the lights. First world problems, I know.<br /><br />For what it's worth, the big 3 smart home apps which seems to be used by these el cheapo devices are Kasa, Govee, and Smart Life. I have devices on all three and the Alexa integration is seemless. Except the darn ceiling fan speed control. Still haven't completely figured that one out entirely.<br /><br />Setting up the devices and Grouping:<br />Both the Echo Plus and 4th Gens are very easy to set up initially. The Alexa app, though not entirely user friendly regarding the UI, does all the work and guides you through the process fairly quickly. The oddball thing that's a bit more challenging is knowing what the difference is between a stereo pair, a home theater and a speaker group.<br /><br />First, a stereo pair must be two identical models (I believe an Echo Sub woofer can be added as the one off) and the pairing is only for music streaming. Only one Echo will respond at a time when you are conversationally interacting with Alexa.<br /><br />In a Home Theater grouping, one or more Echo devices of the same model can be joined with a FireTV device such as the Stick 4k. A sub can also be added. The crummy part at first, is that you can't include your existing sound bar into this Home Theater Group. Amazon devices only, folks. So you must choose which you want to listen to.<br /><br />Now, I'm not horribly disappointed because the sound quality of the two 4th Gens on each side of the TV is really great so the sound bar isn't needed but I hate the thought of the wasted money sitting 32 inches wide in front of me producing no sound at all.<br /><br />IF, you have a smart TV like a Vizio, there is a way to activate the sound bar and have the Amazon Home Theater working at the same time. And here it is: the sound bar must be hooked up to an optical cable and the audio setting on the TV must be set to PCM not automatic. Auto defaults to whatever device you are streaming on ie a FireTV Stick. Then, while playing your FireTV Stick, choose the Home Theater as your audio source on the Fire TV menu. So in essence, the TV thinks it must send sound to the sound bar only while the Stick thinks it should be using the Home Theater. Through whatever glitch, I now have all three speakers working in tandem. BUT ONLY while using the FireTV device. It does not work if I am using the smart TV streaming apps from the Vizio home screen. Which I don't do anymore except for a couple things that are not found on the Amazon App store.<br /><br />FYI, I don't believe that the Fire Edition Insignia and Toshiba televisions sold here and at Best Buy  have the capability to set up the Home Theater function with the Alexa app.<br /><br />Finally, a speaker group is the best way to get unlike models to sync with each other to play music. However, there's a catch... You must ask for that group's every time at the end of your request to play music etc.<br /><br />Meaning, with the stereo pair and home theater, music and movies are automatically played through those selected speakers by means of the Alexa app. You would simply make the standard request for Alexa to play a song or album with no extra added specification. But remember, you're limited to only pairing the same models together for this to work like that.<br /><br />Now, with a speaker group, you can include your Echoes, Dots, Shows, Spots, Inputs, FireTVs, Tablets etc etc into that group and have them all going at the same time through out your home, so long as you name this all-Echo inclusive group something like ""Every where"" or ""all speakers"" or ""whole house"". Be creative :) ""Echo Symphonic Orchestra"", ""Live from the Love Shack"", or ""on all decks of the Enterprise"" (you can even call your individual room groupings for lights and sounds things like "" the Bridge"" -Living Room, ""Ship's Galley"" -Kitchen, ""Ten Forward"" - dining or rec room, ""Shuttle Bay Two""-garage, "" Engineering""-utility room/basement, and ""Captain's Quarters""-master bedroom, ""Risa"" -backyard patio). Lol. Alexa groups can be named whatever you want! I digress though....<br /><br />The point is you have to tell Alexa to play music AND include the name of the speaker group everytime or else music will just play from the device you speak into. Ex: ""Alexa play the song Starships on all decks of the Enterprise"" or (boring) ""Alexa, play Mr. Robot-o, everywhere"" or ""Play a lullaby in the dirty diaper factory (nursry)"". Get it?! I can sense your mind is starting to ignite like a solid rocket booster, now.<br /><br />I really hope this helps someone. I know it's been a learning curve for me. And not always a lot of fun. Just wait til you first start exploring how to build your own custom routines or then decide to relocate devices into different rooms as you upgrade with new ones. It can be a labor of love...or regret.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you  are looking to upgrade but aren't entirely sure, try out the new Echo 4th Gen (especially in a pair for a Home Theater) and decide within 30 days if you really like them. Definitely explore the Alexa app and routines. And commit to replacing at least one bulb in each room with a color changing LED smart bulb to experience the fun you can have with this device. Also, I think you will be pleasantly surprised at what many people say is a drawback about being a directional speaker is really a benefit for most user's needs, including yours.<br /><br />Some people will find fault in anything and some will find that they can't have everything to their exact liking. There's not a perfect smart speaker out there, so figure out what you must have features are, your nice to haves, and your deal breakers are and make the choice.<br />Regardless, enjoy these little glimpses of the future. Heck, they're even spherical shaped just like what the future devices and ships looked like in 2001: A Space Odyssey and Space Balls or a Borg scout ship, even. You gotta think that's at least a nice nod for sci-fi fans everywhere. Or if you are a devotee of mod design or simply a believer in form following function, then this ball of joy is sure to please. So, enjoy your new Echo; It's outta this world!<br />-Picard, out. Hailing frequencies closed.",521,True

Be wary that you don't use excessive force on the screws to assemble the frame (no power or electric screwdrivers) as the threads are very fine and can be easily stripped.

Android was written and runs native on ARM-based CPUs. The Android &#34;port&#34; to x86-64 CPUs is non-native and clunky to say the least. MANY APPLICATIONS DO NOT RUN on the non-native x86 CPUs. For example, Microsoft Office for Android will only run on native CPU devices, so it's technically not &#34;for Android&#34;. Instead, it is for &#34;Android running on devices that run Android natively&#34;. The primary reason I purchased this tablet was to run the Palmer DashCommander, an engine computer monitoring app for diagnosing engine codes from cars. Apparently, DashCommander doesn't run non-native, so this tablet is a waste.<br /><br />The ASUS MeMO Pad 8 advertises to be an Android device, but the device is not capable of running Android-native applications. A misleading, deceptive, and dishonest product description from a technical perspective.

1,Amazing Deal but BEWARE no Intel turbo boost,"This deal is unbeatable but as another reviewer points out, you cannot take full advantage of the CPUs.  A core should overclock to 3.46 GHz when only one core is needed but it only goes up by one multipler (133MHz) to 2.93 Ghz from 2.8 Ghz. This is probably due to an older BIOS but there are no updates available.  The bios version I got was p01-a2 (from Acer) and while I do get google hits for p01-a4 I haven't found or tested it yet.  The updated bios should allow the other cores to be parked to a C6 state and update the power supply states too.<br /><br />Update: I contacted Gateway Support and they sent me a cookie cutter response (notice they didn't even fill out the template &lt;rephrase the issue and narrate here>).

5,Excellent replacement for stock Intel cooler,"My main computer's CPU started overheating (BIOS was giving me beep/buzzer warnings).  I originally assumed it was the heat sink paste that was just too old, and gave out.  Upon inspection, I found that the stock Intel cooler (with the plastic push-pins) had two ""legs"" which failed and no longer held.  In removing it, one of the ""holding"" legs broke off.  So, I was in the market for another heat sink.  Having heard good things about Noctua, I made sure this would work with my *very* old CPU/mobo.<br /><br />The worst part was that I had to disconnect most everything, including the mobo screws, to get their mounting bracket on the back side of the mobo (my case doesn't have a convenient hole there).  But once I got the top brackets and heat sink on, I was quite pleased with how easily and quick it went together (I deal with CPUs and heat sinks/water cooler blocks on a very routine basis, so not a novice).<br /><br />With my broken cooler, my CPU held about 38-39C under no-load, and ~75C under heavy load.  With this Noctua, I am running closer to 36-38C no-load, and &lt;60C under heavy load.  I call that a win.<br /><br />Pluses:  They include a really nice L-shaped phillips screw driver with it.

5,Truly Intelligent Point and shoot camera,"Keep in mind, this IS NOT any where near an SLR camera or even a D-SLR camera.

I'm not an expert, but I am around electronics and technology a lot (mostly gaming and computers) and some of the features this camera has for the price is outstanding.<br /><br />A word about economy. I wouldn't say it is hard to find a good camera. It is just the fact that many retailers offer more ""cheap"" cameras because the cheaper prices attract more foot traffic and more purchases for customers either looking for cameras or passing by them and thinking ""what a good deal"" (not). It is increasingly difficult to find a quality, well made Japanese camera. Many camera manufacturers make their cameras now in China. That is not always bad because many manufacturers sometimes still enforce higher standards of build quality, but you can't beat Japanese made quality in any electronics (cars too).<br /><br />This camera is MADE IN JAPAN. Fantastic!!!! It feels great, has a solid feel while not quite being heavy. The megapixel rating isn't terribly high, however that doesn't matter much unless you are blowing up your picture and making a poster to put up on a wall. I don't do that, i view pictures on my computer and print up 4x6's, 5x7's, and occasionally a 8x10 to frame. What is more important is the image sensor and the size of said sensor.<br /><br />I was amazed when I was taking video how it changes scenes automatically. If i go up close to something it will change to macro mode automatically. It will adjust to outdoor (mountain) setting and also adjust for lower light all automatically. It is also difficult to find a camera in this range that has such fluid zooming capabilities while taking video as this camera graces you with. I was amazed and I took some great outdoor videos by the water and they came out crystal clear in 1080p. Try finding a camera this size, price, and quality that does 1080p video. Most this size only do 720p.<br /><br />Same with taking still pictures. When you put it in IAuto mode which is basically your average auto mode with Panasonic's intelligence system.

4,Weak midranges? Try Windows XP Intel Audio Studio,"I read several reviews of this product discussing issues with speaker placement, too short connecting cables, not much power output and poor midrange quality before buying them. I purchased them for my computer anyway; my placement area is small and the price seemed reasonable for a set of powered speakers with a subwoofer. All were true to varying degrees. The midrange issue was the one that bothered me. Regardless of how high the seperate bass control was turned their tone sounded weak, exactly as with the bass completely off. I tried adjusting the Graphic Equalizer on my Windows Media Player version 11 with no change. Out of curiosity I clicked on the Intel Audio Studio icon at the bottom of my desktop screen. When turned on the sound became richer immediately. I played around with the different 'default' settings-- 'Jazz', 'Bass Jam', 'Opera' etc. and customizable settings were you can adjust each sound frequency individually. This feature when combined with WMP 11's 'SRS WOW Effect' makes the sound more than enjoyable, depending on the original recording however.

3,"The KANN, it has artificial intelligence that knows what you want, need...well nope, and no screen always on function...Not Good","This player has great sound, and the power I was looking for and needed. I like the interface and access to my music, and the build quality is great. I have no problem with its size or weight because I am not packing it around. This is the 3rd MP3 player I have purchased in trying to get what I need, do to the fact my old one, a very inexpensive did not have the power and started to act up. Each time has been an upgrade in price and doing research into what is available at present. This KANN is messed up as well. So now I have a few weeks to decide if I want to keep it. It seems that the KANN has an artificial Intelligence that thinks it knows what you want on your Main Music overall file and this is just nuts. I first made the mistake of syncing the KANN with my computer thinking it would automatically transfer my music to my KANN, which it did nicely to the Main Music overall file. But then I noticed that it had also copied every song multiple times since it found the same songs in different folders where I keep my music. I have my music arranged this way on my computer for playback reasons. So I said OK I will just delete all the copies using the computer....right, after hours deleting multiple copied songs I am ready to go to my KANN's Main Music file only to find the multiple copied songs that I spent hours deleting off of KANN's Main Music file on the computer were not deleted off of the device Main Music file. Really? So I called Astell&Kern Customer service to find out why and how to delete the multiple copied songs off of the device and the agent very nicely walked me through how to delete the copies of songs. So after hours of deleting songs off of my KANN and getting a clean file with just one song each, I am able to play the Main Music file, the first that shows up on my menu option. But I noticed that I needed to rearrange a file on my SD card, so I popped it out and rearranged it and popped it back in only to find that the KANN noticed this and recopied every song over again off of my SD card back to My Main Music file so now guess what??? I am back again where I started with multiple copies of the same songs scattered through out the Main Music file and yes it plays these songs all the way through over and over until it gets to the next group of multiple copied songs...but do not get me wrong they sound great! But as you can see every time you remove and return the SD card it re-copies each song, thus making the Main Music file worthless for play back. This is to me a big problem. Another ISSUE I found and I researched this to the best I could is the screen staying on function. For my purposes I need the screen to stay on the whole time the player is on. And yes I know why the screen turns off...to save battery. But why would a $1000.00 MP3 player not have this function when it has an always on function I will never no. The KANN has great battery life and one could always turn this function to another setting if it was using too much battery power...but to not even have the option to leave the screen on the whole time... this is just BS.The Astell&Kern Rep said...well most people want the screen to turn off to save battery, he did not think any of their devices had that function. Well I guess I am the only one in the world that does, for my intended use of this device, I will use it not only to listen to music but also to perform music live, and I use the scroll function and sec countdown to keep track of where I am in performing the song and when the next song starts and keeping my timing as well, besides enjoying the Album Art. (Which is not just the Album Cover, but other Art as well that I have tagged to different songs) The KANN's longest setting is 5 min, many songs I perform are longer than 5 min. So now when performing, I have to reach up and touch the KANN's on/off button every time a song is about to end to use it as I intended when I decided to buy it in the first place, yet I cannot do this toward the end of a song if I am still playing the song when the screen goes black after 5 min...quite irritating. But do not get me wrong, it sounds great and has the power I need to drive my IEM through my Sure wireless xmtr from my PreSonus mixer so I can hear the music over my guitar and drums. So do I keep this thing and just put up with its flaw's or try to find something else that will work better for my needs...I have not decided yet. So as much as I wanted to like the KANN and give it a good Review....with these issues it is not worth the money and I cannot recommend it to anyone...Sorry.",16,True

5,Beautiful sounding very intelligent player.,"I have two Sonos one and sonos soundbar for music. I am mentioning this just for comparison that what my expectations will be for a new device i plan to buy. I purchased couple of the speakers like JBL link 500, HomePod, amazon echo, Sony xb 41. I made these speakers open box from new. I am sorry for that.  These are beautiful subwoofer. They are particularly deficient in midrange. Which for me is the soul of music. I had made a mind to buy the expensive Sonos move as they are offering 20% discount for the first responder. But i planned to try echo studio before that. The first welcome sound from the echo studio gave me some hope. Then i tried few songs like no sacrifice by Elton john, wind of change by scorpion , top 10 songs in amazon music, couple of Indi and Nepali songs. The system sounds almost equal to my Sonos. It has very sharp sound with balanced low, mid and highs. It also has equalizer in its app which I don't use much because the system by itself adjust the music to its best.

5,Fantastic ITX board from ASUS for Intel Haswell Processors,"Awesome board.  I have this paired with the G3258 anniversary processor.  I noticed a lot of people in the online forums reported not being able to Over Clock even though this board is designed to do this with unlocked processors.  On this H series board the trick is that not only does the ratio need to be unlocked, and the max value set for each core but to realize that this setting will just affect the ""Turbo"" speed.  ASUS utility shows that processor is running under stress at full speed and if I use Intel stress test I noted that the test ran faster / took less time per run as I stepped up the Max Ratio multiplier.  This board paired with an R7 260 and the G3258 makes a fantastic budget gaming build with rock solid components.  One other trick with the ASUS software is that if you use standard user accounts with UAC like I do then you need to set the ASUS apps to run with an admin account under task manager.  I recommend setting your over clock ratio in the BIOS however the utility is nice so you can monitor temps and multiplier for turbo while you test your CPU for stability.  One additional note using Core Temp allowed me to see true temp of CPU cores as they ramped up to full speed during the stress test and the All CPU Meter gadget also requires an additional plug in & selecting to display CPU clock speed with turbo.  Since I am now using this I removed the AI suite since that suite calls several applications that at start up that are not really needed.  So now the desktop gadget shows true core temperature and the unlocked clock speed when it kicks in. I am also going to put a better CPU cooler as well so I can get my temps where I like them.

5,Intel Core 2 Extreme QX6700,"I paid and extra $3.00 for express shipping.  It was ordered on Monday evening and I received it Thursday morning.  Packaging was more than expected for a used product.  The CPU very clean contained in case,  placed in Mylar bag and shipped in bubble  bag. Most importantly of all it worked and continues to work great.<br /><br />I have a Dell XPS 700 that I purchased in December of 2006. The original CPU was a Intel E6400 2.13GHz and achieved a respectable Windows Experience Index (WEI) of 5.1.  Because the XPS 700 has a NVIDIA N590 chipset, I was able to &#34;overclock&#34; (OC) the E6400 to 2.66 GHz by flashing the BIOS to 1.4. and using the &#34;N-Tune&#34; utility from NVIDIA's website.  The E6400 with the OC now has a WEI of 5.3. Note that N-Tune is an operating system (OS) utility and some games act abnormal in this mode. Examples are over talking  or acting like they are on massive steroids.  A nice work around is to use the command line &#34;bcdedit  /set  useplatformclock  TRUE&#34;. This will give the overclock benefit and cause the game programs to behave.<br /><br />The XPS has (x2) GTX 550ti video cards. One is a PNY XLR8 and the other MSI Cyclone-II. The game bottleneck, even with the OC is the CPU, which is why I decided to upgrade.<br /><br />In my research, I discovered that I could add a quad CPU up to a QX6800. It was an obscure statement on one of Dell's forums that went something like, unlike other XPS motherboards (MB), the H2C does NOT support the following…. and a list of CPUs followed.  One enterprising user took a leap of faith and decided that the Dell tech meant that the XPS 700 would support the CPUs in the list and plopped one in and it worked. So, I decided to try.<br /><br />I didn't go with the QX6800 because it was $200 (used) and I didn't want to spend that much on something that might not work. I decided to go with the QX6700. I figured I could overclock it to the 6800 speed.<br /><br />I was fortunate to keep my user manuals, which went into great detail on how to replace the CPU. In addition, there are many instructions, comments, experiences, on the internet on how to replace a CPU.  I knew what products to get, what products not to get and how to precisely to remove, clean, and exchange a CPU on any MB ever produced; it's just amazing the amount of material.  Because of this, swapping out the CPU was brilliantly easy.  The longest amount of time was cleaning my old case of 5 1/2 years of dust.<br /><br />I had already uninstalled the nTune utility because I had no idea what that would do with the new CPU. I turned on the computer and got caught off guard because the BIOS was squawking about the CPU, windows had booted.  I had to go back and reboot to get into the BIOS.  I had read that a multiplier parameter would appear in the BIOS when an &#34;X&#34; chip was installed in the motherboard and sure enough the multiplier was there.  I immediately upped the clock to 2.92 GHz. The system worked perfect. No BSOD, lockups or instability.<br /><br />I then increased the CPU speed to 3.2 GHz and again system worked great. The issue I have with this speed is the core temp increased to 72º at 100%. Now, core temp says the Tj. Max is 85º. I also read that 64.5º was the max temp I should be running this processor. So, I wanted to get the core temperature down. The CPU fan was not at max speed so I installed nTune to see if I could increase the CPU cooler fan. I thought I would be able to control the MB fans, which is an option in nTune, and not adjust CPU frequency. This was not the case.  The computer did not like nTune.  After several BSODs and lock ups, I uninstalled nTune and throttled back the CPU to 2.92. At this frequency and voltage the core rarely goes above 60º and my &#34;real-world&#34; applications are really not affected. In other words I didn't take a performance hit by lowering the CPU frequency to 2.92 GHz.",4,True

3,First Intel CPU that I was slightly disappointed with.,"I purchased this from a local store instead of Amazon.  I did first buy an i3-6100 from Amazon to build a friend a budget gaming system on an MSI-H110M motherboard with 8GB of Kingston HyperX DDR4 RAM and a SSD hard drive.  When that system was done, it was amazingly fast.  This made me get to thinking of replacing an old system of mine that I was using for a Plex/media server.  Since this was not going to be for gaming, I figured I would go down a level and get this G4400.  I am sorry that I did.  Everything is noticeably slower.  I am using the exact same motherboard, ram and SSD in this system as the i3 system I had built.  Web pages load much slower, unzipping large files takes a very long time and just the overall responsiveness of the system is much slower than the i3.  I knew I was not going to have the same performance, but I did not think it would be that noticeable just doing desktop duties.  I really wish I had gone with the i3.  At least I can upgrade at a later time if I wish.",3,False

5,Tired or terrible Intel RAID performance and lack of software options for Windows?,"TL;DR up top: If you're looking for a high performance hardware RAID option, don't be afraid to spend the cash on this product.  It just works.  You'll love it.  Read the updates for how it does handle failures.<br /><br />I just finished building a new desktop that I hope to last a few years before it needs to be replaced.  MSI Z87 XPOWER motherboard, i4770K CPU (water cooled for future overclocking), R9 290X GPU, 32GB RAM, 256GB SSD OS drive, 6x3TB HDDs for storage and shoved it all in to a Cooler Master COSMOS 2 case.  Everything about this system screamed except the HDDs.  The 3TB drives were previously in an external box attached to a Highpoint RocketRAID card.  The performance was crap at best (seriously, avoid Highpoint stuff at all costs) and the drivers crashed regularly.<br /><br />For this build I decided to bring the drives back internal, which is why I picked the MSI Z87 XPOWER because it has 10 6GB/s SATA ports on board, and the case to fit them in.  I configured the 6x3TB drives in to a RAID 5 array using the on-board Intel RAID controller.  While restoring data to the array I found that after a few minutes write speeds would slow down to as little as 4.5MB/s.  So after abandoning that idea I tried to set up RAID Within Windows directly.  No dice, Windows 8.1's RAID 5 is lacking (as in, non-existent, at least by default and software alternatives just didn't seem to exist.)<br /><br />Enter the LSI MegaRAID 9271-8i / LSI00330.  I decided to get serious with my storage and I wanted a card that would scream and would not be a bottleneck in my system.  This card is it.  I wanted a card that could support at least 6 drives.  This paired with a couple of the &#34;3WARE Cable, 1 Unit Of 1 Meter Multi-lane Internal (SFF-8087) Serial Ata Breakout&#34; cables gets you 8 drives.  It's PCI Express 3, but will work in a PCI Express 2 slot if that's all you have.<br /><br />The 9271-8i with 6x3TB drives configured as RAID 5 gives me write speeds of over 600MB/s.<br /><br />On top of this, I also added the LSI LSI00297 CacheVault Accessory.  I picked this up at the poultry site because it wasn't available directly from Amazon and the resellers here had some crazy prices.  It was advertised as &#34;for 9266-4i and 9266-8i&#34; on that site but if you go to LSI's site directly (lsi.com) and search for LSI00297 you'll find it's compatible with the 9271-8i just the same.  The CacheVault Accessory is, basically, a block of NAND flash and a big capacitor and it's used to backup the on-board 1GB cache RAM in the event of a power failure.  This means you can rely on the RAM to store your data instead of having to wait for writes to disk, which greatly increases write speeds.  You don't *need* this, you can force the 9271-8i to trust cache RAM anyway, but you'd want this in a power failure situation.<br /><br />Back to the 9271-8i.  LSI's website, lsi.com, is easy to navigate and finding/downloading/installing OS drivers, management interface and firmware updates is dead easy.  Within minutes of powering up I had updated the default OS driver, installed their management gui and flashed the latest firmware to my card.  The management gui (Windows) is a joy to use and if you know enough to know that you want to set up RAID 5 then you'll have no problem using it.  If you don't want to or can't use the Windows GUI then you're still in luck, there is a BIOS interface to do the same thing, it's just not as pretty.<br /><br />Windows 8 has no problem seeing the logical drive that I created and initializing/using it as expected.  I suspect 7 would be just the same.<br /><br />The card itself is small, the SFF-8087 cable ports come out of the end rather than the side which makes it easy to manage the cables inside your system.  The card is short too, so it won't interfer with drives or their cables in a normal ATX case.<br /><br />If the card gives me any problems I'll be back here to update.  If this review is still sitting at 5/5, you know it's still working great :)<br /><br />UPDATE: 2014-01-04 - small issue.<br /><br />I am running an array of 6x3TB SATA drives and today one of them decided to go unresponsive.  This caused the alarm on the LSU card to activate (it's VERY loud!).  Once I figured out a drive had failed I shut the server down to investigate which physical drive was failing.  I shut down as I didn't want to risk pulling other drives while the array was already degraded.  Once I located the drive and reseated it's cables I tried to power the system back up, but it wouldn't start.  It just appeared dead.  The array is not a boot drive, but I wasn't even getting that far, it wasn't even POSTing correctly.  After lots of attempts at rebooting/resetting the only thing that worked was to disconnect the LSI00297 CacheVault capacitor and fully power cycle.  This did allow the server to POST but the RAID BIOS didn't load, so, no array.  After another reboot the RAID BIOS came back and all disks were once again accessible.  Very frustrating.<br /><br />On the plus side, once I reactivated the drive in the MegaRAID Storage Manager it came back on-line and reported no errors.  Of course I'm running a manual consistency check, but over 6x3TB drives it estimates just 5 hours.  The old on-board Intel RAID would have taken literally 100 hours to do the same thing.<br /><br />I still rate this 5 stars.  A drive hiccupped, but there was no data loss.<br /><br />UPDATE: 2014-06-08 - moar drives!<br /><br />I'm still very happy with this raid controller.  I've since added a 7th 3TB drive.  I found the Windows 8.1 limits you to 16TB partitions.  The other ~400GB is just hanging out there.. I'm going to add an 8th drive to complete the set but I think I'll convert to RAID 6, since I can't use that extra space as part of the 16TB partition and the drives I'm using (Seagate Barracuda) seem to like to die frequently.<br /><br />(Edit: Speed test results removed, Amazon lost the images?)<br /><br />UPDATE: 2018-08-21 - OH NO!!  But, okay!!<br /><br />Since 2014 I've replaced all the drives with 8x6TB WD Reds, switched to RAID 6 and have been happily running a 32TB partition.  Upgraded to a new machine and Windows 10 in 2015 without any issues until today.<br /><br />So after not using my system for 2 weeks (I was out of town), I came back to find the RAID card non-responsive, the virtual drive on it not available.  After turning the system off and pulling the card I found the problem immediately, the heatsink had come disconnected from the main controller chip.  It hangs upside down in the system so the heatsink pulled away and it looks like the raid controller just fried itself, the card is no longer working.  Probably doesn't help that the exhaust of a GTX 980Ti is pointed right at it.  Bummer, that card was 5 years old now and had been serving me well.  I immediately jumped on-line to find a replacement that could be shipped overnight.  I tried ebay, they had cards in the $180 range shipping from China in 2 weeks.. not good enough and even the chance the card was fake anyway.  I came back to Amazon and this listing is still here, shipping PRIME next day for $280.  Worth it.  Immediately ordered it and the replacement card was at my door in 18 hours.<br /><br />I moved the CacheVault and battery over from the old card, reconnected everything and powered it up.  Oh no.. I expected to be prompted to import my foreign config, but instead the card just showed 8 drives and no logical drive in the BIOS.  Once booted in to Windows 10 I tried to start the MegaRAID Storage Manager but found the driver for the card wasn't working either, and couldn't update.  This turned out to be an unrelated Windows 10 Update problem which took some time to fix, but once I got past that and I was able to get the driver loaded the card sprung to life, found the old virtual disk and brought it on-line.  One of the drives was marked as degraded, it was probably being written to when the old card went offline.  Being RAID 6 I'm not concerned about this though, it's currently rebuilding the drive and estimates 24 hours to complete it (remember this is 8x6TB drives in RAID 6).<br /><br />5 years after I originally purchased this card, I'm still very happy with it and it's performance.  I'm probably going to pick up another one and keep it as a spare just in case I can't find a new one 5 years from now and I need to replace this one :)",47,True

Fine, is not OMG AMAZING 5 STARS. It's just that, fine. The 3 stars are because this product, is a joke. IT's the exact same performance as the previous generation, and nobody should give Intel a pass on this behavior. Now that AMD is competing with Ryzen, 8th gen is adding cores.

5,Great inexpensive cooler for mITX systems.  Better than stock Intel.,"I purchased this from Newegg ($30) to replace the stock Intel cooler on my mITX system.  Seems to perform better than stock, at both idle and max load.  I did some crude testing with Prime95.<br /><br />System Specs:<br />CPU: Intel i5 4570<br />Motherboard: Gigabyte GA-H87N-Wifi<br />VGA: MSI GTX 960 2GD5T 2GB<br />Case: Coolermaster Elite 130<br /><br />PERFORMANCE:<br />Intel Stock Cooler:<br />Idle:  41-44 C at 1700rpm<br />Prime95 1 min: 85+ C at 2900rpm (max)<br />Prime95 5 min:  Did not do, as sensor alarm claimed critical overheating.<br /><br />Cryorig C7:<br />Idle: 30-32 C at 1225rpm<br />Prime95 1 min: 70 C at 2350rpm<br />Prime95 5 min: 81-84 C at 2575rpm (max)<br /><br />NOISE:<br />I do not have a tool to measure decibels.  However, I do feel the system is overall quieter with the new CPU cooler.  This is to be expected, given the lower fan RPMs throughout.<br /><br />CONCLUSION:<br />Pros: Super low vertical clearance, great for fitting into small mITX systems.  As there is no overhang, the C7 does not interfere with memory sticks.  Installation process is standard compared to other aftermarket CPU coolers.  The price is much lower compared to similar low clearance coolers.<br /><br />Cons: The fan is attached to the cooler via a proprietary system, so you cannot simply replace the fan if you want.  However, registering the product online provides an extended warranty (3 years, I believe).<br /><br />Comments: I was debating between this and the Noctua L9x65 ($50).  I had read online reviews claiming this to perform at approximately the same level, but at a fraction of the price!  Was not disappointed, and would buy again.",5,False
3,Great laptop except for non-stop error messages from intel HD 530 display driver and out of memory... ???  Say what??,"Except for two GLARING errors, I do love this machine...<br /><br />On a daily basis, I am getting display driver error messages... It says the Intel HD 530 graphics driver has stopped working, recovered, and is now working again... It's says it's a Win8 driver... I have Win10 preinstalled...  Once, THIS is all I got for images on FB (see attached pix)... Talk about upset??  I downloaded and installed the latest drivers to make sure it wasn't an old driver (the Win8) ... It wasn't... I have the latest driver, which is apparently for Win8 and NOT for Win10, so WHY is it in this machine???<br /><br />Also, I wanted the Nvidia to be the default display driver but the intel HD 530 appears to be... I seem to only be able to make the Nvidia be default for photoshop and HD movies... I don' want that stupid intel driver that keeps failing... !!  Too bad, nothing I can do about it...<br /><br />Another common error is that I am running out of memory??  I have 16gb of ram plus  a 4TB drive attached with ample virtual memory as well as only about 100gb used on the SSD drive so there's plenty of room for the virtual memory, which is the recommended size??<br /><br />This is very upsetting... I had decided to give HP another chance after several bad experiences with them on 4 laptops purchased in 2008 and 2010 that melted down because of integrated displays going kablooey and overheating the motherboards... (a class action suit situation that happened to many)...<br /><br />Take your time before ordering... While it is an amazing computer otherwise, those are VERY disturbing things given the history of HP with such things... Those 4 laptops that failed happened to fail a month to a year AFTER the deadline for free replacement/repair so we had to 'eat' the purchase price on them, which was considerable, just like this one, but not quite as high... THAT'S why I wanted to avoid the integrated graphics and went for one with a separate video card... that apparently is NOT the default nor will the computer let me make it be...<br /><br />Also, in the control panel, the Intel HD 530 driver says that it requires further installation... HUH?  It is installed, so what's going on?  Did HP mess it up?  Is it flawed like their older laptops all were?<br /><br />OTOH, it is fast... VERY fast... Clear, sharp images on built in monitor... Highly responsive... Stays so cool it's AMAZING... lighted keyboard is great... Have to use the fn key plus F5 to refresh because the lighted keyboard is controlled by the f5 key, but that's no big deal...<br /><br />Minor Issues:<br />There's no light showing when the num lock is on, which I find annoying, but it's not THAT big a deal...<br /><br />The fingerprint reader is handy... it's ticklish, but it works as designed... you have to swipe just right...<br /><br />Virtually NO paperwork comes with it and you have to make your own 'restore disks' but that's normal nowadays... There IS a restore drive that contains it all if you forget to...<br /><br />You will also need to purchase a SMART 90W power plug as the SLIM 65W one that comes with it triggers off error messages that it isn't powerful enough to run at optimal performance.  You can get one at HP --  HP 90W Smart AC Adapter  Product number: G6H43AA#ABA  They are $69 regular price, on sale $49... Not the fault of the seller here, it's an HP thing they do and you won't know until you set it up and run it the first time.  It WILL run with the standard 65W plug though, so you don't HAVE to upgrade it, but should.<br /><br />EDIT: January 2016, HP issued an update to the intel HD display driver so it will update to a Win10 driver... Now only an occasional error message, not the constant ones like previously... HP still fails in their support for their items but leaving consumers in the lurch over problems such as the display errors, deserving of a C- for customer support, but their customer service has improved considerably from what it used to be.  I'd give customer service an AAA+",20,True

But that's not what this is for.<br /><br />It's better than my old REI for carrying computer gear, with padded pockets while attending conferences and traveling.  And perfect for bringing such things on airplanes, busses, trains, and other civilized places.  It seems comfortable and adjustable enough for some hiking, but I'd definitely rely on something more rugged for real camping.<br /><br />2. It has a plastic synthetic smell, as that's what it's made of.  And maybe from the water repellent surface?  It was probably packaged while still brand new.

5,Great SSD - and some notes for Intel Rapid Storage,"An ideal use for this small SSD is as a booster drive for motherboards supporting Intel Rapid Storage Technology, and especially for SATA III-6GB/sec ports. The OCZ 60 GB works great in this capacity.<br /><br />Intel had with a brilliant idea: Use an SSD as an automatic high capacity cache for an associated hard drive, thereby boosting system performance, especially at boot time and when loading frequently used applications. I just built a system based on the [[ASIN:B0053HCOMM ASUS P8Z68 Deluxe Motherboard]], and it wasn't until I was re-reviewing the MB documentation I ran across the info about Rapid Storage.<br /><br />So, the provisos: If you're installing a new system from scratch, remember to set the motherboard BIOS to use the SATA ports in RAID mode (not SATA or AHCI). But if you're like me and you're adding this SSD to a system you've already built and configured, you don't want to have to go reinstalling Windows 7 all over again. (Info reproduced and adapted from Overclockers. com, original post courtesy of user Eldonko.)<br /><br />1) First, install the RAID drivers (should be on the DVD that came with your motherboard, or downloadable from their website). Or go to the Intel website and get the drivers and Intel RSU software from there.<br />2) Don't connect the caching SSD yet. If you have and followed the instructions to reset the BIOS to RAID, there's a good chance you are experiencing the Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) at Windows boot. Go back into the BIOS and switch the drive ports back to SATA or AHCI (whichever you used at Windows installation time). You don't have to open the case back up and disconnect the drive, don't worry about it. (NOTE: The SSD should be connected to the Intel SATA-III port if available, not a Marvell port. Intel Rapid Storage won't work on Marvell.)<br />3) If you didn't already do so, install those RAID drivers now. Reboot to complete the installation.<br />4) Bring Windows 7 up and do what I do: Save a System Restore save-point (Control Panel > System > System Protection > Create button at bottom). Always do this when mucking with Windows internals. Then run Regedit (as administrator). Locate this key:<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\Iastorv<br />5)In the details pane, right-click ""Start"", and Modify. In the Value data box, change it from whatever it is to the value ""0"" (zero, and without the quotes). This registry change enables the RAID driver in Windows, and tells Windows to load it at boot time. Shut down and if you haven't already done so, connect (or reconnect) your caching SSD, or else just restart.<br />6)On reboot go into the BIOS again, this time changing the SATA ports to RAID mode. Save and restart.<br />7) You will most likely see a RAID configuration screen at initial boot. IGNORE THIS. It's not relevant to what you're doing here.<br />8) Even if you already installed the Intel Rapid Storage Technology utility, you will most likely need to do so again (you can just overwrite the existing install). I think it doesn't register the SSD as available and offer the Accelerate controls until it actually sees a valid RAID-usable drive out there. Reboot again to complete the utility installation.<br />9) Open the utility (available in the SysTray) and enable the Acceleration.  Done.<br /><br />One note: A given SSD will only accelerate a single hard drive. To accelerate a second hard drive, you'd need a second SSD... and chances are you'd be out of SATA III / 6 GB ports at that time, but my understanding is it's still an improvement.<br /><br />Hope this is helpful. (Disclaimer: I make no guarantees, assume no liability, and modding a system in this way is best left to experts and professionals.) So far I have indeed noticed pretty decent improvements in overall performance, and I expect this will only get better as the Intel software puts more applications and core system files out on the SSD.",12,True

They are so dominant that manufactures who carve that little slot in the side of their devices, called it a Kensington slot. (okay, that might be a licensing thing...)<br />This cable is really long. I use mine on a standup desk, that has a single pillar on the left side and one on the right. I wrap the lock around one pillar and then through the loop several times to reduce its size. This prevents it from being expanded while still locked to be pulled off the bottom of the post that is welded on a TEE shaped base.<br />Despite the picture, the lock pivots on the end of the cable, and rotates around the inner lock mechanism, so you won't have the cable poking out in some very inconvenient direction.",3,True
5,Just got this for my Intel i7 iMac..it works wonderfully.,"I just set this up on my 27"" Intel iMac (OSX 10.6) after hassling with a number of incompatible external webcams. But you do have to download the respective software from their website and use it in its independent program. No biggie and it works very nicely. After recording a video clip I opened up iMovie and imported the clip from the Logitech Webcam file folder in the Movies file folder. The quality was superb compared to the washed out quality of the built-in plastic lensed camera in the iMac. No crashes, no lock ups--plus the stereo audio made it all the more desirable. The only issue some might have is that the auto light correction was not overly impressive. But for me it was an insignificant issue compared with the pros of the product, especially since most Mac stuff is outrageously expensive anyway.",3,True

1,Do Not Buy If You Have Windows 10 and an Intel Wireless Card,"Initially it would drop connection a few times a day.

But just as an experiment before returning the laptop I took out the AC2600 and reinstalled my old Linksys E4200; so far I have run 36+ hours without a dropped Wi-Fi connection.  I don't know what it is, but I suspect some incompatibility between the AC2600 and the Intel Wireless 8600 card.

1,Intel just can't get right,"I already own an Intel NUC. I wish I didn't, but I do, and it is essentially a $150 paperweight. I've built computers using Intel motherboards and this is my second Intel NUC. They all have one thing in common: they work as well as a soup sandwich hold together.<br />Here's the funny thing about anything Intel makes outside of processors: they always need a BIOS update (I'm sure some of you Intel die-hards are probably screaming it right now). You get the thing, and the first thing you need to do is perform a BIOS update. Why? Because Intel develops TERRIBLE BIOS software so they must constantly update the darn thing because people keep phoning tech support. I bought this NUC on 1 August, updated the BIOS to the latest version, and the thing wouldn't work. I called tech support today and already there is another update. Now seriously, how often do you have to update the BIOS software on your Lenovo laptop, Dell Server, or HP desktop? Damn near never. MAYBE if there is a security issue or an added feature, but Intel releases BIOS versions seemingly every other month. The underlying issue though, is regardless of BIOS versions, anything Intel makes that isn't a processor works like crap.<br />True to form, and just like their motherboards, this thing is hell to live with. Once you get your OS installed, MAYBE it'll restart, MAYBE it won't. For me, therein lies the foremost problem with this brick: It works when it wants to. It is developed to essentially be a 'set it and forget it' solution. It's a grand idea: you install it, configure it, and leave it as a home server, media PC, kiosk, whatever. Either way, more than a desktop or laptop you might touch every day, it is supposed to simply work. That way, when you put this thing behind a TV, out of view from customers and foot traffic, or in your entertainment center out of view from your guests, it does what you need it to, WHEN you need it to. God help you if you need to restart this thing. And that's what's funny. Despite the fact that they can run Linux, they're (presumably) designed and supported to run Windows, which by design does nothing but restart every damn day. As a result, this thing will restart, hang at the boot screen, and just freeze. No rhyme or reason, no way to make sense of it.<br />The other NUC I have I bought as an early adopter. There weren't many around then, and it certainly wasn't as popular as it is now. I figured after years to work out the kinks, Intel would have improved. WRONG. It seems Intel has adopted the same approach Apple has with the iPhone: &#34;Let's crank out some crap that doesn't work well, but we'll make sure it's 'trendy' and 'the next big thing' and those suckers will eat it up just to be able to say they've got one!&#34; Well, Intel, I've drank the purple Kool-Aid twice now, but no more. I'd rather have an 80 pound desktop that can at least boot dependably instead of constantly having to reach behind the kiosk display, entertainment center, or wherever else I've stashed a mini-server.<br /><br />You can buy this thing if you want, I'm just letting you know.<br /><br />UPDATE: I'm updating my review to keep the masses in the loop. I called Intel because I too had to deal with the issue of being unable to use the keyboard and mouse after booting into Windows install. It's because the USB ports are 3.0 and Windows 7/2008 doesn't support them. No knock on Intel there. In fact, they have a handy-dandy tool that will 'slipstream' the USB 3.0 drivers into your installation media for you with one click. However, I was forced to call back because after 2 weeks of playing with this thing, it is hell to get it to reboot properly. It will just hang at the logo boot screen, for hours if you let it. Sometimes the power button works, sometimes it doesn't, and then the only way to turn it back on is by unplugging the power cord and plugging it back in. Intel says it was a dud, so I'm sending it back. I'll keep you all posted.",8,True

3,Many problems when using Intel MacBook Pro,"Issues I Had:<br />--------------<br />So I'll start by saying I had to contact support because my screen kept flashing on and off every 15 seconds while plugged into the HDMI 2 port on the dock. I could have one screen plugged in to either the HDMI1 or HDMI2 port and it worked fine, but not 2 screens at the same time.<br /><br />After going back and forth quite a bit with this company's support, they ended up sending me 2 separate USB-C cables (instead of the dual USB-C cable that comes in the box). Using 2 separate cables mostly resolved the flashing screen issue. However, when my laptop goes idle (screen turns off because I'm AFK) and then I come back, I have to unplug both USB-C cables and plug them back in or I get the flashing second screen again.<br /><br />No DisplayPort<br />------------------<br />Something to keep in mind is this dock does not support DisplayPort, so if you're going to use 2 screens like me, you will need 2 screens that both support HDMI.<br /><br />Power Cable<br />---------------<br />The power cable that came with the dock did not work at all and was making crackling sounds, but that was OK because I plugged my MacBook's power block into the dock.<br /><br />My recommendations<br />-------------------------<br />If you're going to use this dock, I have some recommendations based on the information I got from their support:<br />1. Plug your Macbook charger into the dock. You don't have to plug the charger into the macbook itself.<br />2. Plug the cord from the dock into the Macbook and that's the only cord(s) you will have to plug in to the laptop.<br />3. Test using 2 screens right away, if you're ever going to use 2 screens. Make sure both screens work through the dock before you miss your return window on Amazon. If one of the screens is constantly turning on and off, I'd recommend just returning the dock.<br /><br />Summary<br />------------<br />Since I have the dock, I'm going to keep trying to use it for a few more months and if anything changes, I'll come back and update the review.<br /><br />That being said, maybe this dock works better on Windows devices. Maybe I just got a bad dock with a bad charger. I'm not sure. When the dock works, it seems to work well; but the dock does not work consistently. I'm hesitant to recommend this dock to anyone else.

5,Finally -- an intelligent way to watch TV,"TiVo has definitely changed the way I watched TV.  I spend much less time ""channel surfing"" and more time watching what I like.  Case in point -- last weekend my wife and I sat down in front of the TV without a plan.  Instead of flipping channels until we found something interesting, we just looked at the list of shows the TiVo had recorded.  The hardest part was picking which one to watch.  Since we could fast-forward through commercials, we watch a 2-hour movie in less than 90 minutes.  The ""live-TV"" options are just as cool.  If the phone rings while you're watching a show, just hit pause.  You can resume after you hang up, then catch up to real time during the commercial.<br />There are two ""negatives"" that I want to mention (however, these don't change my rating...it's still a 5-star in my book):<br />1. The service does not adjust recording time if a show gets delayed (say when a football game runs long).<br />2. If you want to connect to a wireless network using a Linksys WUSB11 Wireless-B adapter version 2.8, you'll have to wait for the next software update (or sign up for the beta version).  According to TiVo customer support (which was very helpful once I reached a real person), Linksys originally told them that version 2.6 and higher would work.

I won't try another from Intel simply because 2 years operation in very ideal circumstances is simply not enough. Your mileage may vary of course. For me the name isn't worth any extra, in fact it's a negative in SSD's.<br />EDIT: Not that it's much consolation but Intel DID replace the drive under warranty with a retail packaged new drive.

2,DisplayPort 1.2 is buggy on this particular NUC. Read my full review. You will be shocked at Intel's response!,"The Intel HD 5000 graphics claims to be DisplayPort 1.2 compliant, however, my experience with this is &#34;it simply does not work&#34;! After months of going back and forth with Dell and Intel on this, here is the reply I got from Intel support:<br /><br />&#34;This issue was escalated to the technical product support engineer for further investigation.  At this moment we do not expect a solution since we are unable to guarantee full compatibility with every single possible configuration or devices available in the market.<br />We truly apologize for this inconvenience.&#34;<br /><br />Really, Intel??? DisplayPort 1.2 with MST is a common configuration that should work with any DP 1.2 compliant device, right?<br /><br />I have a Dell U3014 that does not wake up after going into power save mode with DP 1.2 enabled in the monitor OSD. What this means is I have to power cycle the monitor every time it went to sleep and then resize all of my open windows back to the sizes they were before going to sleep.<br /><br />I have tried three U3014's and three Intel NUC's to no avail. I had Dell verify this behavior on other grahic cards with this monitor in their lab and they reported that they were not able to duplicate the error. They even asked me to send my NUC to them so they can test my setup in their lab. Dell is obviously ready to stand behind it's product more than Intel is based on their response!<br /><br />The net of the story is this:<br />- Intel's product claims to be DP 1.2 compliant, but it does not work with a DP 1.2 compliant monitor (Dell U3014)<br />- I have asked Intel to test this setup in their lab for months, and what did I hear you ask? I heard &#34;Crickets&#34;<br />- I have asked Intel to send me a NUC with the latest graphic chipset so I could test for them, and what did I hear you ask? I heard &#34;Crickets&#34;<br />- I have a Dell U3014 and a Dell U3011 that I cannot use in MST because Intel's product does not support DP 1.2 like it claims it does. What's the implication? I have a $1K+ monitor sitting collecting dust because Intel's product makes a claim that Intel does not stand behind.<br /><br />These NUC's are not cheap and I consider them to be a pretty significant investment especially after you add mSATA, memory, and OS. To spend upwards of $500 bucks for a product that advertises a feature that does not work is disappointing to say the least. But what's more disappointing is the response I got from Intel support.<br /><br />In Closing:<br />-If you plan to use this as an expensive HTPC, it works great for that.<br />-If you plan to use it as a standard PC with DP 1.1 and even a second monitor via HDMI, it works great for that.<br />-If you plan to actually use the advertised feature of DP 1.2 and MST, it is a complete failure and I would stay way from it.",1,True
5,Intelligent means better protection for you,OK Pay attention to Line Interactive AVR  the difference here is that it keeps the voltage constant to your device (PC) A regular Back UPS may have a nanosecond before it switches to battery power and that may just be enough time to Freeze or shut down your system unexpectedly. Line Interactive keeps the power flowing constantly and therefore less likely that you have a loss. Maybe a few more $$$ but worth it in the end.

1,"Works well for a while, then becomes the worst investment ever! Get Intel instead!","Update:<br /><br />I contacted ASUS support, which informed this is still under warranty, so I can fill out an RMA. But I'm very skeptical that it will help, and they even say they might charge you for a return if they suspect a hint of damage, despite the bullcrap their product has become for so many customers. Considering how quickly this behavior has gotten VERY bad, I don't think I'm even going to do the RMA anymore, I'd rather just throw this crap in the trash as soon as I can get a replacement.<br /><br />A few days after that, I literally have to force my computer to shut down often within 30 minutes or less to have wifi access!

Upgrading the MeshForce network to a new version seems to have fixed that... for now.<br />- In the last couple days I've randomly have the Wifi card stop working completely, until reboot.<br />- Furthermore, when looking to update Wifi drivers, it says there is one from 2018, but when I download and install, it still says its from 2016.<br /><br />This is a big dissapointment for me, after having such a great relationship with the Asus brand for my other products.",3,True

5,Great Intel Drive with a 5-year warranty,"When you lose data on an SSD it's all gone.  It's not like with a mechanical hard drive where data can be recovered.

So naturally, the Intel 520 series drives are perfect for someone like me; someone that likes a long warranty on high-quality products from a reputable manufacturer.<br /><br />I've run some performance tests between this and my Extreme II drive and while the Extreme II is a little faster overall, the Intel's speed is consistent with no dips in performance while the Extreme II does have the occasional dip.<br /><br />I only trust Intel drives for my OS drives.

1,the intelligent tablet purchase,"First off, the worst thing you can do is compare this to an ipad. It's not an ipad and wasn't designed to be compared to one. It is a droid tablet, nothing more and nothing less. It comes with a 1Ghz processor which will enable one to do most anything they need a tablet to do. But here is why I think it is BETTER than an ipad and a more intelligent purchase.<br />I bought three of these coby's for Christmas for my 6, 9, and 12 year old daughters.

Now don't get me wrong, I own many apple products- three ipod touches, two nano's, a shuffle, and the best ipod ever made- the last ipod video 30gb which came before all the proprietary hookups.<br />The Coby name is symbolic of electronic toys for kids, but this isn't the case with these upper end Coby tablets. They are built very well and I have read that there is a piece of stainless steel that runs the length of the tablet inside, result being they don't flex in your hand. The displays are very nice, however they are not in the league of ipads or other $500 samsung, toshiba, or motorola tablets. However, they are a fraction of the cost and still look absolutely great with no fading viewing angles I've read some high end toshiba tablets suffer from.<br />Let's talk about what they have over the ipad- versatility. An HDMI video out, a 2.0 usb port with a full-size usb jumper (adapter), microSD card input and two stereo speakers vs one on ipad. A person can run video out of this to their HDTV, hook up a keyboard or monitor, add memory with the microSD card, etc. Apple has one hookup- and it cannot be used for any of those things.<br />As far as the full android market, it can be added in 5 minutes (youtube has a great video, type in ""android market on coby kyros"") with no mods (rooting) required.

1,"A barely functional camera for less than two years, ripe with unintelligent design flaws.","This product has many downfalls. First, you cannot see the screen underwater because it is not bright enough. You also cannot see the screen when you are above water outside on a sunny day. And these are likely the two most frequent situations you will be using this camera in. There is no viewfinder, so seeing the screen is even more important on this camera than many of its competitors. Due to the screen being invisible, you also cannot tell whether the camera is even on or not. The button to turn it on is finicky and it is very hard to tell whether your press registered or not. Same goes for the button to take the photo. You will end up with about 1/4 of the photos that you intended to take. The shutter sometimes chooses to beep when the photo is taken, and other times it does not. It makes you try to take the photo about 20 times. Very unreliable. There is a light on a &#34;on&#34; button, but it is so dim that I wonder why they event wasted materials on it - you can only tell if its on when you are in a dark room. Finally, the camera was not designed to ensure that you don't have giant image-morphing drops on the screen when you pull it out of water to take a photo, so many of my photos were wholly distorted with large drops of water across people's faces.<br /><br />I found that the camera works well in pools, which are usually well lit underwater so you can see the screen when the camera is under the surface. But again, pull it out of water and you see nothing. And after two years and fewer than 15 outings, the screen stopped turning on altogether. Now to take a photo I have to aimlessly point and hope the photo is captured. And you cannot check what the photo looks like until you take the memory card out. It's basically like having a film camera with no viewfinder. And the last time I pulled my memory card out, it was damp. Luckily, it appears not to have been damaged. I called Nikon for support and they said I would have to ship it in for them to even tell me a) if they CAN fix the issue, and b) how much it will cost. I'm leaning against this, though. I'd be gambling the shipping costs on the chance that they MAY, for ADDITIONAL undisclosed cost, be able to bring my camera back to its original finicky and barely functional self of sometimes being able to take water-droplet-covered photos that you cannot check until you get indoors. I feel that they should have a repair location in Manhattan that I can visit for the cost of a round trip on my unlimited monthly metro card. I'm spoiled, but the convenience of having retailers a swipe away is one of the major benefits for which Manhattanites pay such a large premium for. In general, for all customers regardless of location, the least they could do is pay the shipping costs - it is not the customer's fault that they chose not to set up a repair location in the largest city in the United States, or in any other location where their customer resides. So I have decided that I would prefer to just save both the shipping cost and the additional repair cost to put it toward purchasing a better quality camera. I will not be returning to Nikon for future cameras after this unpleasant experience. And I am taking recommendations for a new underwater camera.",1,True

5,A sound bar that won't insult your intelligence,"There's nothing new about the features offered on this unit--except their availability in a sound bar, for under 300 dollars.<br />The HT-XT1 is built like a tank. Steel construction, tempered glass top, 170 watt amplifier, quality speakers including two down-firing subwoofers. It weighs a solid 18 pounds. Packed tightly inside is an actual, all-in-one home theater control system. On a clearly accessible back panel, the unit boasts three 4k capable HDMI inputs. Wait a minute--there are also optical and analog stereo ins. That's five inputs--on an economy priced sound bar. But wait, there's more!  Also modern Bluetooth NFC pairing support. But no--it can't be...They all sync to a summed HDMI ARC output--just like grownups get with an A/V receiver. Thank you Sony, for not punishing me just because I chose a sound bar over a big, bulky home theater system.<br />Sony provides a snazzy remote with a hidden slide-out function for customizing the unit. Ok, but I easily programmed all the functions of the HT-XT1 into my Logitech Harmony One. The Sony is now the seamless control center for my whole setup.<br />None of this convenience would matter if the sound quality wasn't up to par. It is. Clean, well balanced, with surprisingly good low end for any small to medium sized room. Surround sound content is nicely re-purposed. I don't hear things behind me, but the soundstage is widened and defined well considering a single sound source. There's a Night Mode that compresses and shapes the bass output so the cops won't come knocking after curfew.<br />A lot of sound bars suffer vocal clarity for lack of a center channel speaker. Sony provides three Voice adjustments for dialog. I currently use setting 2 for most tv or movie content. There are varied soundstage, subwoofer, bass and treble tweaking options to suit each sound source or input.<br /><br />Tradeoffs were made here to keep design simple and pricing competitive. I do have a wish list for future models. Maybe one analog output, or add a subwoofer output. The tempered glass top has etched backlit buttons for On/Off, Pairing and Input, but volume up/down or muting on the unit itself is sorely missed on occasion. There's a glaring light bleed just underneath the bare bones LED display. I put some dark masking tape over it, but it shouldn't be there in the first place. Could just be on my machine.<br />These minor quibbles are nothing compared to the amazing quality and value offered here.<br /><br />I've been shopping these devices a long time. With the HT-XT1, Sony establishes a new category of quality, connectivity and features in its price range. That, in itself, indicates a higher level of respect for the sound bar customer base. I hope other companies are paying attention.",26,True

Intel is always improving their products, their technology is way superior that AMD, it just outperform AMDs.<br /><br />When you see a processor, don't just consider their cores and the speed, they are several things to consider about the processor's speed, like BUS SPEED for example and other important factors.

Add in 128GB of ram, a few enterprise NVME SSD's, and hang on to your hat.  Intel can't come close on price and performance.  Being my first AMD build ever, in over 20 years of computing, I wasn't sure what to expect.<br /><br />You won't regret it.  Just do it. AMD finally earned their place at the front of the line while Intel churns out re-hashed 14nm processors ad nauseam.<br /><br />I considered the 3960X threadripper, but this CPU plus motherboard was less than the cost of the 3960X all by itself.  I just couldn't justify the cost.<br /><br />While we can't have it all, I would have liked to see more than 20 usable PCIE lanes off the CPU, plus 256GB of memory support.

5,The Sweet Spot for Intel CPUs,"This is a real a real powerhouse of a CPU, with 6 cores and 12 logical threads, it just rips through anything I have thrown at it.

5,"As a long term user of MS Intelli Optical Mouse, I love this one!","I've been using Microsoft Intelli Optical Mouse, v1.1, perhaps, for about 20 years now.<br />I think it may be over 22 years, but I cannot actually remember when I started to use the MS Intelli Optical Mouse. While I was  using it, I felt it was really a nice one to go with. It operated relatively smooth throughout working and gaming, it was very comfortable for my hand and wrist. The weight and the friction was in just good amount that I felt no fatigue over hours of use. I expected it would not be discontinued from the market without being substituted by more potent ones.<br />But as time went by, I realized that it was running out of stock and there were so many people who loved the MS IO mouse just like me. I managed to purchase a number of MS IOs and from then on I have been using those ones that I purchased just about the time it was discontinued.<br />I tried several other mice but I found nothing could be comparable to the MS IO mouse.<br /><br />And, on 2018, I purchased two of this MS Classic IntelliMouse.<br />But while I had MS IO mouse, I did not open the box and tried this one.<br /><br />Okay, meanwhile my IntelliOptical mouse seemed to go wrong. I couldn't bear unpredictable, spontaneous double clicking of left button any longer. So I decided to repair a few IO mice which were out of order and I picked one of this MS Classic IntelliMouse and tested it.<br /><br />Now, I've been using this mouse for about 16 hours or so.<br />My first impression was that It's larger, heavier, built more robust, more beautiful, working more smooth and precise than MS Intelli Mouse Optical. I love the white tail light which can tell it's position in a dark room and those materials felt by my fingers and palms are pretty much better than the MS IOs. The surface is smoother and the lower part of side walls are coated with rubber-like material so that the mouse could be moved as if it was part of my hand. And increased DPIs(up to 3200) and report rate(1000/sec.) makes me feel that this is a true upgrade from the IO mouse. The cursor moves smoothly and precisely.<br />I felt that this is a little bit larger than the IO. My palm span is about 8 inches or 20 cm and I felt no difficulty in holding this mouse. I hope that the size should be similar to the IOs. Anyway good grip provides no discomfort related with increased size.<br /><br />I remember some bad reviews which came out when this first appeared in the market. I was also somewhat scary to see such reviews. But, as a long term user of MS IO mice for decades, my first impression is very nice. The one significant issue would be like how long these good impressions can be maintained. I also purchased a number of Microsoft Pro Intellimice. I am expecting much more for them..<br />But I think this Classic Intellimouse is a definite upgrade from the previous version. I hope MS could keep up with the needs of customers and produce such good items for a long time.",0,True

4,NOT compatible with 9th generation Intel Core processors out of the box,"I was so excited to use this motherboard. It was well-reviewed on Tom's Hardware, had all the I/O I needed (with room for expansion), and even had RGB lighting! Unfortunately, when I put everything together, the computer wouldn't boot. The motherboard does not have a POST speaker built into it, so I had no beeps to troubleshoot. I tried breadboarding, using different RAM (as the Corsair sticks I bought weren't listed on the official manufacturer compatibility site), booting with only the processor and RAM attached, removing and reattaching the CPU heatsink in case it was shorting something, and even buying a new power supply (thinking maybe my original 550w from 2007 wasn't pushing enough power to start this arguably more efficient machine). No boot. I went to our local computer parts store and bought a POST speaker because I knew I was at the point that I needed those beeps for troubleshooting. Imagine my shock when powering on the system yielded no sound! I knew I was seriously out of practice, having last worked professionally in computer repair all the way back in 2010, but was I so out of practice that I had broken something during assembly?!<br /><br />No. The answer is so much simpler (and more irritating) than that. See, everything you read about this motherboard says that it ""supports"" the new 9th generation Intel chips with a BIOS update. Nowhere does it tell you that the computer will not boot, AT ALL, without this BIOS update. It will not even POST! If you're upgrading your mobo in an existing system with an 8th core processor, you'll love this board. If you're updating your mobo and processor but you still have a working 8th gen on hand, you'll be perfectly fine once you run the BIOS update. But if you're like me and you're doing a new build with the latest processor (technically mine is an upgrade from a Core2Duo system, so it's functionally a brand-new build as everything had to be replaced), this board WILL NOT WORK. You will have to borrow an 8th gen processor from a friend and run the BIOS update, or buy a Z390 motherboard. Those are your only choices if you're set on building with a new 9th generation chip.<br /><br />In summary, if this is for a new build or rebuild with an 8th generation Intel processor, enjoy. If you're buying this for your first build and/or multi-generation update with the new 9th generation processors, FIND ANOTHER BOARD. THE Z370s ARE NOT SHIPPING WITH THE BIOS UPDATE IN PLACE. I CANNOT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. PCpartspicker will tell you it's compatible, and it is -- ONLY after the update. If this review saves even just one other person from going through the hair-pulling frustration I went through when every Google search told me this board was ""compatible"" but the stupid thing wouldn't boot, then my work here is done.<br /><br />(Review note: I'm not taking off any stars for the fact that I had to return this board. It's not the manufacturer's fault that English is a screwy language and ""compatible"" can mean both ""works instantly"" and ""can be made to work"". The -1 star is from the positioning of the SATA connections, which are in line with the PCIe x16 slot. If you're using any real gaming card, like my GTX 1060 6gb, the SATA connections end up behind the card. I have tiny little girl hands and a spacious computer case and I still found it difficult to plug in more drives once the video card was installed.)",120,True

I am currently using Lightroom to edit my work, and when the drive would fail, Lightroom would loose the catalog. When you have 500+ images to edit and the drive dismounts every 45 minutes, this can become a huge issue.<br /><br />So, I did some further research and found out that several other intel mac users are having the same issue with this product.

5,A nice bag with intelligent design,"Tough i wanted to buy this bag but still i was in confused state since i couldn't find much review on this neither in Amazon nor on net.<br />So i decided to write a review .. hope it helps some body to judge.<br /><br />Lets start with the bag size:<br />The size of the bag is just fine for a DSLR (i own a canon eos rebel T3) with 18-55 lens. It can also fit in an additional lens of canon 55-250 without any issues. But after these two things the cam is filled up and no additional things can come in inner pockets. There is a back pocket where you can put some papers, camera guide of small books maps.<br />Front two + two packet is there which is enough for additional memory cards, charger, battery etc.<br />Overall the bag is spacious enough for a DSLR with an additional lens and cam accessories.<br /><br />Quality:<br />The bag quality is awesome and i guess it will be durable enough.<br /><br />Style:<br />The bag looks stylish and with NG logo.. its classic :)<br /><br />Amazon:<br />Ordering it with amazon is always good. Since you will be assured of receiving the correct thing on time. I appreciate amazon for its commitment towards quality.<br /><br />I recommend this bag if you have an additional lens to carry and you don't want to go for some big bulky backpack.",0,True
5,"Seductive, Intelligent & Sleek design!","I have tried many camera straps but PD rose above the glut of cheap, frustrating tethers that come bundled with your camera. It uses a combination of seductive materials, quick adjustments, and a unique connection system called Anchor Links that lets you quickly switch between multiple cameras.<br /><br />Peak Design created Slide out of 45mm seatbelt-style webbing for looks and strength. They hooked it up with aluminum buckles that are meant to be speedily adjusted and dependably secure. It has certainly succeeded in creating a strap that is visually appealing while maintaining those tenets of photographic stealthiness—namely, it's black, and that's a good thing. The seat-belt webbing is silky and malleable, a tactile pleasure to handle. There's also a thin layer of extra padding in the middle of the strap's length, along with rubberized strips meant to hold it in place over your shoulder.<br /><br />Slide sets up super easy. Anchor Links—the little plastic discs that tether to your camera and attach to the strap—do a great job at solving the problem of having multiple cameras and not wanting to buy a strap for all of them. You simply loop the little nylon cords through your camera's eyelets, and snap the plastic discs into Slide's connectors. Press down on the disc and it disengages and slides out. It's an action you could do without looking, but requires enough force to reassure you that the link will never ever unfasten itself. Of course, it is scary knowing your camera is dangling by these narrow strings, but Peak Design says they can withstand 200 lbs of force as well. That should accommodate any reasonable camera payload.",8,True

The system boots, but WiFi an Bluetooth is not detected in device manager. A shot in the dark, I installed the drivers for this card manually and, sure enough, nothing.<br /><br />Not the chips' fault.

1,"STAY AWAY - Burned out my Intel S3700 1.8""","I bought two of these because I had purchased two S3700 Intel enterprise SSD drives in 1.8"". The one adapter didn't work at all. The second adapter worked for a few minutes. It recognized the drive. I opened up the disk cloning software and it hung. It was hooked up via USB adapter, so I unplugged it. The cloning software (Acronis) immediately loaded after unplugging. The SSD was very hot. After several attempts with this and another adapter that drive will no longer be recognized. The other drive, works fine with a different adapter. Another reviewer had mentioned that his brother had bought one that worked and his didn't. His was missing two diodes. I can confirm that neither of mine had the diodes just the space for them on the board. I'd guess the diodes are in part responsible for the 5v to 3.3v conversion (USB is 5v). I would not recommend trying to use one of these without the diodes, especially if not connecting directly to a power supply with the optional dedicated v3.3 line (orange wire).",1,True

5,Great Small Surface (and How to Fix Intel WiFi),"I just got this yesterday and was so excited to use it for my meetings this morning.  I have been wanting to become a digital note taker for a long time, but never really adapted to writing onscreen with my iPad.  I may not be able to adapt to it with this either, but I am going to give it a try.<br /><br />I set it up last night and after a series of Windows Updates, the Intel Wifi card stopped working.  Reverting to the old driver did not fix it.  So, with no wireless connectivity, I hooked up a USB-c to USB-a adapter to a USB ethernet adapter and connected by ethernet cable to update any additional Windows Updates, but nothing fixed it. Installing the latest from Intel's site did not fix it.  Disabling and re-enabling in Device Manager failed to fix it.  Uninstalling the card and deleting the drivers did not work either.  I also tried disabling MIMO in the driver settings, but to no avail.  Finally I found a forum post that says to go into the UEFI (by shutting down completely, holding Volume up, pressing power, still holding Volume Up).  Then disable the Wifi/Bluetooth in Devices.  Reboot.  Repeat the steps to shutdown and enter the UEFI, and then re-enable Wifi/Bluetooth.  I am so glad that fixed it!<br /><br />I have seen and heard some reviewers give the Pentium Gold chip in this Surface a lot of criticism.  Sure, it is slow by comparison to other chips, but it is capable enough that I don't mind using this device for office tasks and entertainment.  Mine is the Pentium Gold with 128gb SSD model, and 8gb of ram.  It scored a 433 on Geekbench 5 for single core and 993 for multicore.  Slow yes, but not unusable.<br /><br />I bought the Slim Pen and black keyboard cover (it smells weird).  After my adventures in solving the wireless card issues with a pieced-together wired networking solution, I bought the Travel Hub (which after the wireless card issues, the Travel Hub will be priceless must-have).<br /><br />Now I want a full-size Surface Pro 7...or maybe even the awesome looking Surface Pro X (once all the software issues are solved with emulation).<br /><br />Overall,  I am looking forward to using this for work and play.",2,False

They seem to run hot on the inside and burn out whatever moxie keeps them kicking out radio signals. This ASUS replaces something else, I forget what, and I sincerely hope it lasts longer than a year or two.  Had it a couple of months and no problems so far.  Bought a second one as well for a different system.  The strength of the radio signal in this model is adjustable via software, and I've noticed a definite improvement in range and signal strength from these guys. The best part is the setup software.  The user interface is strong on graphics, clean, and strong on explanations and hints.  Particularly useful in my application is the guest network; you can actually set up six guest networks if you need to.  Setup with Comcast cable was quick and trouble free.  Also appreciate the on-off switch, an improvement over having to yank the power cable to power it down.  All in all, an intelligent software design mated with a powerful radio engine.

5,Yamaha demonstrates the finest audio industry intelligence by offering Clear Voice & Bass Extension settings.,"Adjustable Bass setting (1-9) even without the Bass Extension on. It also has the most important setting (to me) Clear Voice to hear dialogue clearly. My Samsung tv has a Clear Voice setting also, but the Yamaha allows one to make adjustments to how the video broadcasts the audio, so the bass and midrange sounds can be turned down a bit in order to hear dialogue without other sounds overpowering the dialogue. I've had to rewind movies so many times it annoys people, so at some point I would stop mentioning that I'd prefer to rewind it to hear what they said. Also, if I were watching a movie with someone, they usually want me to turn the captions off, so without a way to read what they were saying nor hear it clearly enough, I'd lose some of the meaning in whatever was said during that part of the movie, so that the person watching it with me would not be bothered.
