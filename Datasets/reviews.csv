The performance bargain of the century.",22/02/2023,"I won't go into much technical detail here since there's people a lot smarter than myself who can get into the nitty gritty. Generally speaking though - this CPU absolutely smokes, especially for the price. Don't let the 'i5' name fool you. The i5-13600K (and KF) is a top-class processor that for most users, will offer more than enough performance for intensive tasks while having probably the most reasonable power consumption and cooling requirements of the top-three 13th generation Intel processors.I came from an i7-5960X - still a solid processor in this day and age but unfortunately my motherboard wasn't exactly kind to me attempting to take it above 3.8 GHz. Despite it bottlenecking against my 2080 Ti, it still ran cool under a 360mm CLC, topping out at no more than 51 degrees C gaming (GPU load) and 60 degrees under full CPU loads. But since the current market for new components is pretty good, I opted to go all in on a 13th gen build rather than find a better X99 motherboard.Odds are, you're probably going to be cross shopping the i5-13600K with the i7-13700K and the i9-13900K. Unless your workflow necessitates the additional core count or you're chasing records, the performance difference between those CPUs and the 13600K did not seem worth the hundreds of dollars of additional cost and the massive increase in peak power consumption. Power also equals heat, and that was another motivating factor for going with the 13600K, having been accustomed to a relatively cool and quiet build for some time. That said; with the additional cores and much higher boost frequency, I was expecting higher peak power draw and temps despite a lower TDP on paper.And they were definitely higher, under the same 360mm CLC. After running benchmarks with Cinebench and 3DMark, I was hitting peak temps in the mid-to-high 70s under full CPU loads. Gaming loads however were definitely more manageable though, sitting in the 40s and seldom breaking 50 degrees, which was actually a small but appreciable improvement over the 5960X. I'd advise at minimum a high quality air cooler or a 240mm CLC for this processor.The out of the box performance is something else though. I managed to hit 23345 on a multi-core Cinebench test and a 16459 combined score on 3DMark Time Spy. Again, this is stock clocks paired with an overclocked 2080 Ti and 32GB of DDR5 at 5600 MHz. At 3440 x 1440 and 144Hz, games run like butter. I could dabble in overclocking it since I have the headroom but honestly, I don't see the point. It's fantastic as is.All in all, I feel like the 13600K is kind of the no-brainer option for most people looking to put together a high-end system on a budget. You're getting most of the performance of it's more expensive stablemates for a much lower price and less obnoxiously high power and cooling requirements. The KF is also a little cheaper if you don't need integrated graphics. Just buy it. You'll love it.

What an amazing CPU!",28/03/2024,"Using it with arctic freezer 34, even overclocked, temperature is great, and it is amazing for gaming and work. I am rendering in 3ds max much faster now! Incredible value for a professional cpu.

Amazingly underated cpu",01/06/2024,"Been using this cpu for about a year now and it's amazing. For every game I play, some of which are known to be cpu intnesive, it has only gotten up to about 30% usage. Sure it is not a cheap cpu, but it definetly has the processing power despite being an i5. Even when I have stress tested it to 100% usage, it still easily stays cool with a vetroo v5 cooler. Plus you can brag to people that your cpu has 14 cores and 20 logical processors. great cpu, would recommend

Coming from i5 12400f",11/04/2024,"I was on the fence about upgrading from i5 12400f, which is a beast of a cpu. Some pros and cons.  My specs: RTX 4070ti,  z790 ddr5 gigabyte mobo, 32 gb fury ram, 1tb WD black SSD gen 4.Pros:More coresNoticeably faster in some areas like booting and some applications.Some triple A GPU bound games will get a noticeable FPS boost. (Not huge, talking 3-10 at most).CPU bound games (emulators for me) will get much better stability and cpu usage reduction.Cons:If you are looking for energy efficiency these 13th gen and higher chips are NOT it. More cores means more energy draw for sure. On Triple A games the chip is using 20-30 watts more electricity. In emulators like RPCS3 it’s nearly double. I went from 30- 40 watt average to average 80 and in some instances spiked above 100. The good thing is emulators are much less GPU bound so the wattage balances out, sort of.Heat- I’m running an AIO lian li 360 Galahad, with the 12400f I was nearly always running at room temp (my house gets lots of shade and stays cool/cold) so I was used to 22c range. With the 13600k you  will see a 10 degree increase even at idle. Emulators will get into the 60s while triple A games 40s and 50s. With the 12400f my fan curve rarely ever triggered high fan speeds. With the 13th gen you will definitely hear those fans work at load.Side notes I tried the 13600k on two mobos (z790 and 690) you can use it on older 690 compatible mobos, you just need to flash bios to latest. It was super easy on the gigabyte z790 and 690 mobo.Overall. The performance jump is noticeable in some games. But far more noticeable is the increase in heat and wattage usage. If you have a 12th gen and are on the fence you really don’t need to upgrade, however depending on what you are doing with it could be the main factor. I wanted my RPCS3 to run at 60fps in 4k constantly and the 13600k did the trick.  (playing MGS4 guns of the patriots in 4k and stable is unreal!)

Great performance!",04/05/2024,"No issues, added to my system after having an i7-7700k for 7 years and this cpu is worlds better, games are smoother and overall processes are faster. I’m glad I upgraded especially when paired with a 4070. This is a great upgrade option!

Perfect processor for those on a budget!",30/04/2024,"If you looking for a processor that won't break the bank, at the same time will give you plenty of performance for gaming and ever day work, then look no further. I upgraded from a i7 8700k, and the difference is night and day. I believe 13600kf is the best bang for your buck. Don't hesitate. You won't regret it.

Great for gaming",23/03/2024,"Currently I have this cpu and my 4070ti connected to my 5120 x 1440 monitor. It does great. Never does this cpu lag and it rarely gets above 65 degrees. Even when the same cpu and gpu were connected to the 360hz monitor I have it never had an issue hitting 360 fps at 1080p in most titles.

Sam,N/A,Great Upgrade,13/01/2024,"Upgrading to the Intel Core i5-13600KF Desktop Processor from my Ryzen 5800X3D has been a game-changer for my computing experience. This powerhouse of a processor, with its 14 cores (6 P-cores and 8 E-cores) and a substantial 24M cache, has significantly enhanced the performance of my system. The ability of this CPU to turbo up to 5.1 GHz is particularly impressive, contributing to a remarkable improvement in processing speed and overall system responsiveness. Whether I'm running demanding applications, engaging in high-end gaming, or juggling multiple tasks simultaneously, the i5-13600KF handles it all with an ease that is immediately noticeable. The efficiency and speed are especially evident in CPU-intensive tasks, where this processor clearly outshines its predecessor.Beyond just raw performance, what I appreciate about the Intel Core i5-13600KF is its balance between power and efficiency. The division of Performance-cores and Efficiency-cores means that it smartly allocates resources based on the task at hand, ensuring optimal performance without unnecessary power consumption. This aspect is crucial for a balanced system that's powerful yet not overly taxing on energy use. The upgrade process itself was straightforward, and the compatibility with a wide range of motherboards and hardware made the transition smooth. In terms of gaming, the difference is palpable, with smoother frame rates and faster loading times. For creative tasks like video editing and 3D rendering, the performance boost has been equally beneficial, noticeably reducing the time spent on rendering and processing. All in all, the Intel Core i5-13600KF has proven to be an excellent upgrade from the Ryzen 5800X3D, offering a superb blend of performance, efficiency, and versatility. It's a 5-star processor that I'd highly recommend to anyone looking to upgrade their system for an enhanced computing experience.
