AFAIJYOUO3NAWLBDIKTQSC3DASWA,B07659Z1QM,5,1,False,"Maybe it is just because I haven't upgraded my monitor in a long time and maybe it is because this is the biggest monitor I have ever had on a computer, but I love this monitor.  Since I spend a lot of time on the computer, this has a feature that is very important to me, which is low blue light emissions.  The blue light that comes from monitors is not good for our eyes, so a monitor that claims to reduce that is a good thing, if it really works.  I don't know how to tell for sure, but after using the monitor for several days, it does seem that I suffer less eye fatigue.  The monitor also has a &#34;bright intelligence&#34; button that automatically dims or brightens the screen depending on light levels, which helps reduce eye fatigue.  This feature can be turned on or off to your preference.  There a number of different light adjustments on the monitor and they are not difficult to select, once you figure out the buttons to set them.  There are 5 adjustment buttons, but none are assigned to a specific function, but there is a way to assign some of the buttons, so they are configurable to some extent.  Initially, you press any one of the buttons to bring up a five selection menu on screen that allows you to adjust brightness, depending on what you are doing (web surfing, multimedia, office or reading) as well contrast and sharpness.  There are various other display adjustments for positioning the screen (which I had to use, since the screen was initially slightly off center at the highest resolution).  Also there are adjustments buttons for sound, if you use the built-in speakers and for auto shutoff time (choice of OFF, 10, 20 and 30 minutes).  There are various other settings.  I don't quite understand all the settings, but there is an included manual on the CD that comes with the monitor and the manual seems very complete, is well written and easy to understand.  My monitor also included an HDMI cable.  I tried using HDMI, but couldn't see much difference in that and the older type of connector (which they call D-Sub, also known as VGA, which is an analog connection vs. digital).  If you are watching Blu-Ray movies, HDMI should give you a better picture.  I don't have any Blu-Ray movies, nor a DVD drive that supports Blu-Ray, so no need for HDMI.  Also, I use a KVM switch to control several computers and that doesn't support HDMI connectors.  The included CD also has any drivers you might need, but the monitor worked perfectly on Windows 10 without the need to install any drivers.  The HDMI connection did bring sound to the built-in speakers, as well as the picture, but the sound volume was extremely low, even at 100%.  When I used the other connector (D-Sub), and a separate audio cable, the sound volume was much better.  Maybe something I am setting incorrectly?  Also, typical of speakers built-in to a monitor, the sound quality is very poor.  If you listen to music much at all, you will want to stick with external speakers.  This is probably typical of all monitors with built-in speakers.  It was disappointing, but not unexpected.  The monitor is very lightweight, so it is very easy to move.  Has a nice low profile base.  Can be tipped to a desirable viewing angle, but no height adjustment.  There is a lot to this monitor and to take full advantage of it, I will need to read the manual to understand all the available settings.  Requires a 2 step assembly of the base, but it is very easy; you should be up and running in mere minutes.  This can be wall mounted, but requires a separate wall mount kit, which is not included.  Overall, a great monitor that should meet the needs of just about anyone.  With a 3-year warranty, you can't go wrong."
AHV6QCNBJNSGLATP56JAWJ3C4G2A,B09PBPXVTP,5,0,False,"My husband has an Intel mini computer that is nearly identical to this in looks, but it's at least a few years old. This one is noticeably faster. It can be used anywhere you have WiFi. When you turn it on the first time, it's ready to go. It boots up to Windows and all you have to do is give a username and you're ready. It can be hooked up to a TV or monitor using HDMI. It's compact. We're going to order another one for my elderly father because it takes up so little space but it's very powerful."
AEDHXXX2F66EMWOSSPCQHS62UKNQ,B01DFKC2SO,5,1,True,"I bought this Echo Dot bundled with the Fire TV stick, a really good deal.  I had resisted buying the Echo previously because I thought it was nothing more than just a glorified interface to a Google Voice Search.  But it is so much more.  It adds a layer of intelligence that knows most of the time the context of exactly what it is you're asking for and is very fast to respond.  By adding &#34;skills&#34; of your choice you expand its capabilities through Voice-driven Alexa driven apps.  The colored rings around the Dot add a bit of visual feedback to its current state that is also helpful.  I renamed the Dot access name from Alexa to Computer so that I can pretend I am Captain Jean-Luc Picard from Star Trek, which is pretty close to the capabilities that it can provide."

Resolution is comparable to my Iphone, which is very sharp.<br />2. Networking rang works better than any device I have tested.

AER6WLSJPBPNOZIQWVHQBVOKTNCA,B09KK1VDKC,5,0,False,"Crisp hi-res touchscreen. Nice aluminum case. It's big but thinner and lighter than a 17-inch HP Envy. It works fine as a regular laptop but then you can flip it over into a tent, use it with the keyboard flat against the ground or even as a big tablet. The hinges feel very solid and the display will rotate any direction you turn it.<br /><br />It's way more than fast enough for home and work. The SSD is great. The Intel graphics don't seem to lag and you can even run games with decent framerates. The speakers are good enough. The screen can get reflective if there's a lot of light behind you. The battery says it last 7 hours though with full screen streaming video it lasts three. There's a sliding shutter over the camera. There's not a lot of bloatware, just a few apps that are easy to delete."
AER6WLSJPBPNOZIQWVHQBVOKTNCA,B0B5B88GQW,5,3,True,The hi-res touchscreen is the main reason to buy this computer. Everything looks very sharp. It comes in a thin aluminum case you can flip into tent mode or with the keyboard against the ground or into a big tablet. It's way more than fast enough for home and work. The SSD is great. The Intel graphics are OK and you can play some good games with decent framerates (I have Epic and Steam installed). There's a sliding camera shutter. The battery lasts about 6-8 hours with normal usage and the whole machine is very quiet and non-intrusive. Has thunderbolt 4 and 2 USB 3.2s.<br /><br />The trackpad is huge but hard to press down on sometimes. The sound should get louder. The keyboard is good but the keys are silver and can be hard to see sometimes even though they light up. The screen is somewhat reflective so I set the Windows background to gray. Overall though it's a great big screen laptop.
AGDCD2ZNYMDZAVQKQ3RZ56LJTRVQ,B00ZV9RDKK,5,0,True,"since I'm already a prime member, and I'm willing to pay a little fee every month for Netflix as well, we're hardly watching any network television but also aren't paying ridiculous fees for 101 channels we never watch.  more than enough good and intelligent and fun content to keep me well occupied on those long winter evenings."
AEYGPUCRKH7G4VM22FM3VAKSQ23Q,B01CDYB0QS,5,3,False,"After a month, this LG ELECTRONICS 4K UHD 27UD88-W LED-LIT MONITOR still takes my breath away.  I’m not a gamer or a professional photographer, but I still can appreciate having crystal-clear resolution and stunning color for everything on my desktop.  The extra width (27” diagonal) means the desktop itself is huge, even when the display is set to show text, apps, and other items at 200%, as I prefer.  (If I use the included Split Screen 2.0 app, which makes full use of the 3840 x 2160 native resolution--using tiny icons and text, and offering multiple options for 2 or more split screens--there is an incredible amount of desktop workspace available.)<br /><br />The one snag that I ran into, is that the on-board graphics in my 3-year-old ASUS computer (running Windows 10) were NOT capable of displaying the 3840 x 2160  native resolution.  This meant that the monitor would not display my Windows desktop until I purchased and installed a new graphics card.  My card is a NVIDIA GeForce GT 710 (in stock at Best Buy in the gaming section).<br /><br />Any of the following graphics cards will work, with either a DisplayPort or HDMI connection.  For Windows OS:  (1) the Intel HD4600 or higher; (2) the AMD HD7000 or higher,  the AMD R7 or Higher, or the AMD FireProW600 or higher; or  (3) the NVIDIA GeForce GT 640 or higher, the NVIDIA Quadro K500 or higher, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX960 or higher.  For Mac OS:  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, early 2015); MacBook Pro (Retina, 15-inch, mid 2014); Mac Pro (late 2013); iMac (Retina 5K, 27-inch, late 2014 and after); MacBook Air (early 2015).<br /><br />The monitor worked with the drivers that came with the NVIDIA card, but had a barely visible flicker.  Installing the drivers that came with the LG monitor itself corrected the flicker and resulted in the beautiful display that I love.<br /><br />The monitor's simple, elegant design is also worthy of comment.  The stand is rock-solid, and the curved base not only looks great but takes up little space on a table or whatever you have it resting on.  The flat display screen is adjustable to many, many angles.  Because the stand is so well thought out, this very large, very wide monitor seems to use only a little more space than the AOC 24&#34; widescreen monitor that it replaced."
AHUPTBY3F3UN2S5H7K5JLP6MAV5Q,B0BFHQVWKL,2,0,False,"UPDATE (from 5 stars to 2 stars): JAN 2023: One of the HDMI ports stopped working, so now this thing has become pretty useless to me. If it had continued working, this would have been great. But unfortunately it randomly stopped working one day and it hasn't worked since.<br /><br />This little thing has been wonderful. I have a 2018 MacBook Pro (Intel, not M1/M2) and I was looking for a dock that would allow me to use 2 separate monitors with the laptop lid closed, and this one is perfect.<br /><br />It is pretty small (5"" x 2"" x 0.5"", smaller than a Pro Max iPhone) and has a premium metal (?) feel to it (all I know is that it isn't plastic). All you need to do is plug it into the MBP and it works from there (side note: you need to install a quick driver before using the dock, but it's very simple)<br /><br />I appreciate that it allows for pass through charging (which also ensures that high-energy USB devices receive ample power). Additionally, it is really nice that this has both DisplayPort AND HDMI, which is not common based on what I've seen.<br /><br />My only gripe with this is that there are only 2x USB ports (which I knew when I bought it). If you're looking for an easy to use Thunderbolt dock for your MacBook Pro, get this one."
AHUPTBY3F3UN2S5H7K5JLP6MAV5Q,B0B4RYZPFH,2,0,False,"I am quite disappointed in this dock. It had lots of positive reviews, but for my Intel (not M1/M2) Macbook Pro (2018), it only lets you output to 1 unique monitor (if you have more than 1 monitor plugged in, they will all show the same thing), even if your laptop lid is closed.<br /><br />The description said that for M1/M2 Macs, all the external monitors would show the same thing. But this is apparently the case for Intel Macs as well.<br /><br />Would NOT recommend if you have an Intel Mac and want to use 2 unique external monitors."
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,B07HBQSCM3,5,0,False,"I am blown away by this stand. It is simple, yet I absolutely love it. It comes collapsed and took a lot of my strength to pull apart and move it into a desired angle. I have another stand that serves almost the same purpose but it does not have the quality or angle functionality of this stand. Also, the other one requires a quick assembly each time I use it.<br /><br />I can adjust the Boyata Laptop Holder to the angle most comfortable for me. I can also use this to angle my screen and also use a separate keyboard and mouse (which I can store underneath when not in use). Also, this fits my LG Notebook, my 12.9&#34; iPad Pro, my [[ASIN:B01MTGLBP5 Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 9.7&#34;]], and my Google Nexus 7 comfortably.<br /><br />Pictures 1 & 2  shows my LG Notebook front and side stand profile.<br />Picture 3 shows my 12.9&#34; iPad Pro<br />Pictures 4 & 5 shows my  9.7&#34; Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 in portrait and landscape<br />Picture 6 shows my 7&#34; Google Nexus<br />Picture 7 shows the top of the stand. Since the center hole is small, this will hold many tablets and notebooks and small laptops.<br />Picture 8 shows my LG Notebook closed with mouse pad on top and room enough to store my mouse and LG flip phone behind it. If I were also using a wireless keyboard, I could have slipped that in the space underneath the stand.<br /><br />Only time will tell if the &#34;hinges&#34; on this stand will last and not collapse. I suppose if one changes the position of the stand daily, that this may not be so sturdy. Nevertheless, so far I love it and am thrilled that I ordered this. If it should fail in any way, I will update my review.<br /><br />UPDATE August 5, 2020 - I have been using this daily with my LG Laptop for almost two years now and it is still going strong. The stand does not collapse when I type on my laptop and it holds the keypad at the perfect angle. I would defintely order another one if I needed it."
AFXF3EGQTQDXMRLDWFU7UBFQZB7Q,B00O0M750W,4,5,False,"See BUYER BEWARE NOTICE at the bottom of this review.<br /><br />This is one impressive, sleekly designed, well-built notebook with a bit of a ""cool"" factor. The resolution and color vibrancy is amazing for gaming, movies, pictures, etc.  The 15.6 inch (viewing region of 17 inch screen) touch screen is responsive.  The red backlighting on the keyboard and speakers is cool. At almost 5 pounds (4 lbs. 11.9 ounces), this notebook is heavy.<br /><br />After the system is set up, startup is practically instantaneous. Setup takes a little bit because the system has to be personalized (although some of the personalization can be skipped) and a Microsoft account has to be created. I had to temporarily turn off the MAC address filtering on my router because the MAC address of the wireless NIC is not supplied on the setup card that comes with the notebook.  I could have used the supplied USB Ethernet Adapter but then I would have been tethered to my router and its location.<br /><br />During setup, I had to check email on another device to verify my email account and get a security code. I'm not sure how this would be accomplished without having a second device (such as a Smartphone) with which to check email, authenticate your account, and retrieve the security code needed to finish setup.<br /><br />After creating a Microsoft account, I was ready to use this notebook. One month's free subscription to McAffee ""Virusware"" is included.  Additional setup is recommended for OneDrive and some personalization settings for McAffee.<br /><br />OneDrive is your cloud storage for pictures, PC settings, and new documents.  These items are backed up to the cloud (to OneDrive) by default so that they can be retrieved from any device if something happens to the laptop. However, that only works if those features were set up and the documents library was added during setup. Apparently, there's a way to turn off cloud backup if one so chooses after setup, but I haven't figured out how to do that yet.<br /><br />The game graphics are stunning and the keyboard responsive. I was amazed at the vibrant colors shown in my flower photographs which were never visible on any other devices I viewed them on previously.  The quality of the sound is pretty good; although I wish it were louder when watching movies.  I did try to pair my [[ASIN:B00MPMK3GW Goal Zero 94014 Rock Out 2 Green Solar Rechargeable Speaker]] with this notebook using Bluetooth and it paired but no sound would emanate at all from that speaker.  I believe this is a problem with the Rock Out speaker and not the notebook.<br /><br />These are the few negatives that I discovered when using this Omen notebook.<br />- The function keys not easily seen. The Fx notations are so small but it really does not matter much because I am familiar with where all function keys are located.<br />- All four UBS ports are in the back of the unit. The power cord interferes with one of the USB ports. When I plugged in a mouse to the port next to the power cord, I had to swivel the cord until I could get the mouse cable to seat correctly.<br />- The audio is pretty good but not great.<br />- A fully charged battery lasts less than 2 hours on the HP recommended setting (not the Power Saver mode). For me it lasted 1 hour 35 minutes and then I got a warning that it was very low.  I had about 10 more minutes left on my battery when I checked it.<br />- The screen only has 15.6"" of viewing capacity<br />- The notebook is heavy at almost 5 pounds (4 lbs. 11.9 ounces)<br /><br />Based on the setup information, the notepad I received came with:<br />- 462GB (only 426 GB are free at delivery)<br />- 16.0 GB RAM<br />- Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4710HQ CPU @ 2.50GHz 2.50 GHz Processor<br />64-bit OS x64-based processor<br />- Full Windows Touch Support with 10 Touch Points<br />-Windows 8.1<br />- Generic PnP Monitor (Intel (R) HD Graphics 4600 (GeForce 333.55 Driver)<br />- Resolution 1920x1080 recommended<br />- It also has a Webcam, SD memory card reader, and HP Omen programmable gaming keys.<br /><br />Despite its heft, limited battery power, good but not great audio, and the location of the USB ports in the back, I still feel this notebook is a great contender for gaming, movies, pictures, etc. It also comes with a one-year limited warranty.<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE: The specifications on Amazon do not match the notebook I received although the model number was the same on the box (#15-5010nr).  HP has several options available for the OMEN. Unfortunately, I've been unable to find a comparison chart on the differences on their website.  If you order this one on Amazon, you will most likely get a notebook with 256 GB hard drive and 8 GB RAM instead of the 462 GB hard drive and 16 GB of RAM I received. As of this writing, it appears that you will not even be able to buy the model Vine reviewers received on Amazon. My review is for the notebook I received which is the HP OMEN Notebook Model 15t-5000 CTO Model:K7N95A5.  Thanks to another reviewer in pointing this out."
AHPFHP43AXWRYZZ4HPNCW7I7J3ZQ,B00M58CMYC,5,1,False,"All I can politely write is that what an amazing experience.  The headphones are small and just sit over the ears (like their noise canceling headphones).  The Bluetooth component sits neatly inside the headphones, as we have another Bose Bluetooth headphones and the Bluetooth component sits outside of the headphones.  I synced this with iPad, iPhone and iPod Classic (using Kokkia I10).  The quality of the sound is fabulous as you would expect from BOSE ( a lot of bass) you will not be disappointed.  I played a range of music from rock, pop and classical music...awesomeness is the experience with Bose!  The range is not miles...more like 20 feet..and not through too many walls. ...terrific design of compactness and total comfort on my ears.  In terms of external noise, it really did cut out the concrete jungle living of traffic hum.<br /><br />I listened to my music for over an hour now and no pain on my ears...bliss and worth every cent and pennies.  I love these new BOSE Bluetooth headphones.  Note, they come fully charged.  There are little and discreet volume up and down buttons, which are elevated a little so it is easy to find and you will not end up pushing the wrong button.  I didn't have to press any additional button to synch..there is a voice telling you that it is seeking to synch..and will let you know when it has connected. There is a button to switch from music to speak on the phone.  Crystal clear.  It comes with a power charge..a micro USB cable and a RCA cable.(hmm redundant with Bluetooth, but if you have digital piano, you can connect it via the RCA.  I am going to get the Bluetooth adaptor to test it with these head phones).<br /><br />The headphones remember all the names of the gadgets, and will play from which ever one that is 'on', which is a huge plus.  There appears to be an intelligence here that we do not see in the Bose over the ear wireless headphones.<br /><br />In term of play time, after a full charge, which took less than 2 hours: total playtime is more like 8 hours, not 15 hours claimed, but it must be related to the volume too.  I had my volume pretty high most of the time.  Given, how quickly it charged up, and the number of hours of playtime, I really don't need to charge it up for more than one every three days.<br />Also comes with a compact and stylish case to store the wires and headphones when not in use."

It would have been nice to add some features that allow you to change the aperture, for example (not a lot, just some).  Otherwise, this camera is very intelligent and takes great pictures (in wide screen form too that allows you to view it on one's HD TV with no black bars on either side); the mini movie feature is excellent and pick up sound a long way off too.

AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,B0159WEDCO,5,13,False,"[[VIDEOID:9c7f474d82697dfd8035b3c7cf95ccc5]] I am a longtime graphics tablet user, having started with a Bamboo small. Since then I have had several tablets including a Bamboo Fun Pen & Touch, am Intuos4 and finally an Intuos5 Medium. All of the tablets I have used have been Wacom tablets; this is my first experience with another brand, and it is the first time I have even heard of Huion as a brand. To me it makes sense to compare this tablet with my Intuos5, with which it actually compares quite well for about 20% of the cost.<br /><br />My test system for testing this graphics tablet is a Dell laptop, with an Intel i7 processor and 16G RAM, running Windows 10 and Corel Painter X3.<br /><br />Comparing this tablet to the Intuos5 it is approximately the same size (both are medium tablets). They both look very similar at a glance and there are some distinct similarities in the pen and pen holder as well. In operation they are both similar but there are some very distinct differences, and each one has advantages over the other.<br /><br />One of the differences between these two tablets is that the Huion tablet has a numbered gauge across the top of the writing surface and includes a replacement surface in the box; the Wacom does not. The gauge is not a big deal but it does make a nice measure if you are looking for consistency in length of lines. The replacement surface is another matter – it is easy to damage the surface and over time it does get scuffed, so being able to apply a new surface is a huge plus to me.<br /><br />The pens are different and there is give and take with them. The Wacom pen is sealed and does not need batteries or recharging. It is also reversible and both ends can be configured for drawing. Typically one end it set up as an eraser. The Huion pen is rechargeable and is not reversible. I prefer the Wacom pen, but I like the feel of the Huion pen and it works well.<br /><br />The pens both come with a stand, extra nibs and a nib extractor. The Wacom stand is slightly heavier, but otherwise they are functionally equivalent.<br /><br />The software is obviously different, and I have been experimenting with the Huion software to learn how to configure the buttons. The Wacom software is a little more intuitive, btu I have found the Huion software to be a bit more versatile and it provides better control. Speaking of buttons, the buttons are a little different between these two tablets with the Wacom providing fewer buttons but providing a scroll wheel.<br /><br />Both tablets have 2048 pressure levels, and the only real way to test the pressure levels and drawing capabilities of each is to use a drawing application and start experimenting. I loaded up Painter and selected some acrylic brushes and started playing. I was able to get very similar results using the same brushes and the application had no issues with recognizing the pen or the position on the writing surface.<br /><br />Operationally, these two tablets are very similar. However, the Wacom is more expensive – a lot more expensive. The Huion tablet costs roughly 20% of the cost of the Wacom and to be honest when I compare these two it is hard to justify the cost of the Wacom when the Huion tablet works as well for so much less.<br /><br />Working with the Huion graphics tablet has been an eye-opening experience. It compared beautifully against a Wacon tablet of similar size and capability. I am very pleased with this tablet and can heartily recommend it as an excellent alternative to more well-known brands.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was provided a sample of this product in exchange for a fair, honest and thorough review. Even though I received this product at no cost I have rated and reviewed this product without bias, based solely on my experience with it."
AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,B00K4PAP06,4,40,False,"The majority of Ultrabook computers on the market right now are ill-suited for the gamer, concentrating very heavily instead on the business user. With this particular Ultrabook, Dell has found a balance between the two groups and has produced a system that does well both as a business workhorse and a middle-of-the-pack gaming rig, at a very reasonable price point. I can think of a few relatively minor changes I would make to this system to make it even more attractive but that would mean increasing the cost.<br /><br />Right out of the box, this computer feels very well constructed. The lid is brushed aluminum and does not flex like that of some other systems I have used in the past and that's reassurance that the screen will face less stress from being flexed. The hinge is nice and tight too, and from what I can ascertain so far it should hold up for a very long time. The overall system has a little bit of heft to it as well, feeling quite solid. I personally prefer a system that feels rugged, even if it weighs just a little more.<br /><br />At its thickest this system is roughly an inch. This is great - it fits beautifully in my computer bag and leaves room for papers and folders with it in the same bag. This is a minor point, particularly if the user is going to leave this system on the desk all the time, but I find it to be a positive trait. Other systems I have used have been a snug fit in the bag and require a little more planning when packing for use on the go.<br /><br />When first powered on the system walks the user through the setup process, eventually landing at the Windows 8.1 Metro interface. A quick check confirmed that Windows 8.1 Update is *not* installed by default, and this actually came as a surprise. Microsoft has made it clear that the update will be required in order to get any further updates, so I would have thought it would have been part of the configuration already as this system has very recently come to market). I pulled it down from Windows Update and it installed without a hitch.<br /><br />One of the first things I did with this system was to build recovery media. Dell won big points with me on this - while most (if not all) other manufacturers seem to be going towards creating USB-based recovery images (and many rely on the built-in Windows 8 recovery media creation tool), Dell still allows the user to create DVD recovery media. I made two sets. The utility that Dell provides is just as simple and smooth as can be, was easy to find and worked without a problem. This is exactly the kind of experience most users should expect, regardless of manufacturer.<br /><br />This is an Ultrabook-class system and as such there are certain things to keep in mind. First and foremost, this system has no CD/DVD/Blu-Ray drive of any kind. Having an optical media drive on an Ultrabook is rare so this is not a shortcoming per se, but it does mean that users need to have an external DVD drive in order to work with any platters in this system. This is inconvenient but it's the norm for Ultrabooks. Also, this system has only three USB ports, a HDMI out port, an SD card reader and no VGA out (which isn't any surprise actually). Some Ultrabooks do not have an Ethernet port and rely solely on the wireless network adapter, but this one does include an Ethernet port.<br /><br />Dell makes a point to extol the virtues of their touch screen, and so far I have found the screen to be above average. The resolution is 1920x1080 which makes for very clear, crisp images but it also means that print is very small at maximum resolution. I will likely lower the resolution slightly which will make everything a little bigger and easier to see, but some people likely will especially like the ability to cram so much more on the screen. The screen is very bright, too, and my particular screen has absolutely no dead pixels. The important feature of this screen is the ability of it to receive and process touch and gesture events. It is very responsive and so far has given me no difficulties except that my fingers are a bit large and sometimes I touch something next to what I want on the screen.<br /><br />Typical notebooks and Ultrabooks available come with 8GB of RAM. This one comes with 16GB which is great for those running multiple applications simultaneously or are running virtual machines. I was a little puzzled, though, by the ""DDR3L"" type which I had not seen prior. It turns out that DDR3L is a low-voltage variant of DDR3.<br /><br />The hard drive in this system is a generous 1TB hybrid drive, which means it is partially SSD and partially traditional platter-based. The idea behind this type of drive is to put the bootable OS on the SSD portion and everything else on the platters. I see some advantage to this and the system boots up in a reasonable amount of time but I don't see this system coming to a ready state nearly as fast as systems with a straight SSD. Also, this drive is a 5400-RPM drive which is slow by today's measure. I personally would prefer to have less space and have a purely SSD in the system, but that would drive up the cost a bit.<br /><br />There are two graphics controllers in this system. One of them is the Intel HD4000 controller which is part of the Core i7 chipset. The other is an ATi Radeon R7 M265, sporting 2GB of display RAM. This second adapter is what allows this system to run more graphically intensive games, though it is not a high-end controller and struggles to render the top new titles at maximum resolution. As a test I had my teenage son load up a 1st-person shooter he likes and he was favorably impressed with the ability of the system to keep up with it. I also loaded up a drawing application with complex artistic brushes and tried to overwhelm the system. While the system lagged behind when I pushed hard enough, it kept up admirably well.<br /><br />One of the features generally pushed with Ultrabooks is battery life - lower power consumption and only necessary components should extend the run time on battery power. I have found the run time to be roughly 3 to 3.5 hours which is a little low. There are a few contributing factors to this that I think can be partially overcome. First, the system has a backlit keyboard that is on by default. This lighting can be turned off and this will help. Also, the default power scheme has the screen brightness up a little higher than expected in energy conservation settings, so lowering the screen brightness is a good option as well. However, the hard drive is a traditional platter-based drive. If replaced with a SSD instead the power consumption could be improved even more.<br /><br />Dell touts their sound system on this Ultrabook as being something special. Using just the speakers this is not obvious as the speakers are only average. However, when the system is used with headphones the difference becomes very apparent and it is clear that Dell put some thought and effort into the sound system. The default sound profile is good - very crisp highs, warm midrange and full bass, all suitable for gaming. The sound profile can be changed to another pre-defined selection by selecting a menu option on a Dell-supplied utility, making the sound system very flexible. This is a bit unusual for a system - I am used to this for individual applications. With such effort put into the sound system in this computer it is puzzling that Dell chose mediocre speakers.<br /><br />This particular system comes with facial recognition software that is supposed to make logging in easier. I did not like it one bit - the software seemed to have trouble recognizing my face and would not allow me to log in, even with the correct password. I uninstalled it when I finally got logged in.<br /><br />As I write this, this computer retails for about $1,150 (though is a hair less expensive here on Amazon). Considering the feature set, this is a very reasonable asking price. I can think of a few improvements to the system, such as better speakers and a SSD instead of a traditional hard drive but adding these in would increase the cost of manufacture and would therefore increase the end-user cost as well.<br /><br />Dell has put together a nice system that finds a good balance between business uses and gaming. There are systems better suited to gaming available but these typically come at a higher cost. It has a nice touchscreen, good sound and generous storage. The ATi graphics adapter makes the gaming experience not only possible but pleasant. Other than a few smaller point this is a solid and well-designed system that is worth a look if you want a system that can handle most functions without argument, all worth its asking price."
AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,B00HO5JE3I,5,64,False,"At first glance the Asus VivoBook V551LA-DS17T appears to be a nice touch-screen UltraBook-class computer, but it is a few steps beyond a typical UltraBook. Combining features of UltraBook systems and multimedia/entertainment workstations, this computer is what new systems ought to be. There are a couple of design decisions I would change and it's by no means a high-end gaming rig, but Asus got the important things right.<br /><br />There are two things that set this system apart from a normal UltraBook. First is the inclusion of a slimline CD/DVD R/W drive. I have seen no other UltraBooks out there that include one, so finding one in this system was a very pleasant surprise. Carrying an external CD/DVD drive around can be inconvenient (especially when traveling) so having a built-in drive is a huge plus. Asus managed to include this drive in the system while still keeping the system to roughly an inch thick. The other differentiating factor that makes this system different than other UltraBooks I have seen (and not in a positive way) is the weight. This is a particularly heavy system and will make toting it around a chore.<br /><br />I booted up the system and configured it for use and immediately went about looking for the utility for making recovery/restore DVD media. After searching the file system and the installed program list with no success I finally resorted to calling technical support. I spoke to a charming young lady who was exceptionally helpful and got me on my way to creating a recovery USB drive. So, from that experience I can say that technical support is courteous and helpful. However, I never did figure out how to make DVD media, but at least I can restore the system now should I have a need to do so.<br /><br />After power-on for the first time it performed a bunch of hands-off updates and when it finished and finally allowed interaction with the OS it was loaded with Windows 8.1; it wasn't obvious if the initial OS install was 8 or 8.1 but that is irrelevant - 8.1 is what is there when the user can finally begin exploring the system. I spent a little time digging through the list of installed applications and was pleased to see that Asus did not load this system up with excessive bloatware. There are several applications I do not need and I intend to remove them - MS Office and McAfee protection services being among them - but at least what is there is not unreasonable. Interestingly, most new systems I have used have come with 1-2 years of internet security protection, but this system comes with just 30 days.<br /><br />One design decision that really surprised me is that this system does not include a solid-state drive (SSD). I understand the reason - it drives up cost - but to me having an SSD in this system would make it even faster and make the battery last longer. This is by no means a deal-breaker but bootup times are slower as a result.<br /><br />Asus makes a big deal about the touch screen on this system and touts it as more sensitive than most other touch screens. Asus' claims appear to be well-founded as the other touch screen systems available to me are nowhere near as responsive. After spending a couple of hours working with this system I unplugged my trackball and I don't think I will need it again for this particular system. If you are buying this system for the ability to use the touch screen, you will be pleased.<br /><br />Battery life so far is excellent. I charged the system up completely and spent a good three hours using it for web surfing and typing up documents and the battery still maintains more than half of its charge. I plan to load up my development environment and see how the battery holds up under load, and I expect that to make the battery drain faster, but for typical use (surfing the web, writing document and watching online videos) the battery seems to be very much in the game.<br /><br />The graphics system is provided by the Intel chipset and it is acceptable for most uses. It's not high end graphics but it's not terrible either. Serious gamers will not appreciate this system whereas most casual gamers and people using the system for more business-types of functions will be more than satisfied. As an experiment I had my teenage son load up Minecraft (an online game that uses 1st-person perspective) and test the graphics. He noticed that while the game played well enough it is not quite as smooth as a system that has a dedicated graphics card.<br /><br />Wi-Fi connection speed seems to be about average with other wireless-n devices on the network.<br /><br />One thing that really startled me is the quality of the sound system. Asus says that this is the best configuration for embedded sound available and I found the sound quality coming from the embedded speakers to be more than acceptable. The speakers are on the bottom of the unit and are visible via two inch-long slits in the case. In spite of the small aperture, the output is very good, better than one would expect.<br /><br />With the slimline DVD and the decent sound quality, paired with the i7 processor and 8GB RAM this system is well-suited for multimedia tasks such as video production and music creation. It has the horsepower to handle the renders and so far has performed well while working on either audio or video composition. As I mentioned above I expect these types of activities to take more battery than less strenuous tasks but I have not spent enough time with these types of applications on this system yet to determine just how much they will impact battery life.<br /><br />The touch pad is a bit better than average and is placed well. One issue I have with most laptops is that I tend to tap the touch pad while typing and on occasion I can highlight and delete a whole section of text unintentionally. So far this has not been a problem with this system and I think it has a lot to do with the way the touch pad is positioned relative to the open space on the keyboard. Asus includes a very nice utility (accessible by a special key on the keyboard) that makes turning the touch pad on and off very simple, so it's easy to eliminate any issue with it if it's ""in the way"" while typing.<br /><br />The power adapter is odd and I am not sure I like it. The shape requires a little planning as it is a square block pressed against the wall when it is plugged in. Most adapters typically have the brick in the middle. So, plugging this adapter in when working in a cramped space could potentially pose a challenge. Another observation - the adapter gets rather warm.<br /><br />I do not like the way the hard drive is partitioned right out of the box. It appears that the drive was simply chopped into two roughly equal partitions, the D: drive labeled as ""data"". I would rather have one large drive, instead of two smaller ones. This is a personal preference though and I am sure most will be indifferent.<br /><br />I decided to toss in a Linux LiveCD and boot it up to see how well supported the touch screen is with a current distribution. The system refused to boot from it initially; to get it to boot I had to turn off Secure Boot in the BIOS after which I was able to boot up from the DVD. My distribution of choice for this experiment was Mint 16 with the Cinnamon Desktop. I found that there is basic support in place for the screen, though only as a standard pointing device (a lot like using a Wacom tablet) and not as a swipe and gesture interface. There are other distributions out now that are geared more towards tablets; I will try one of those and see how well it works out. That said, the fact that the desktop at least recognizes the screen as a pointing device and properly responds to it is a good thing.<br /><br />A few other technical details: The system has 3 USB ports (two of them USB 3.0 and one of them USB 2.0), an HDMI port, an Ethernet port (which is not a given anymore when it comes to notebook computers), an audio out and a SD card reader. Given a choice I would have liked to have a VGA or DVI port to put the display on a second screen but that's not something I have seen on the most recent systems.<br /><br />Asus has put together a very nice UltraBook-like system in this notebook. It's a nice workhorse for most uses and the touch screen is absolutely wonderful. The system's a bit hefty though and might prove to be cumbersome for those on the go, and the graphics system is not at serious gaming level, but the system is a solid performer and provides the best features of an UltraBook and a multimedia workstations in one place."
AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,B007TSERQO,4,0,False,"This is my third (and final) write-up on the Magellan RoadMate 2220-LM. I decided to rewrite my review again after making more discoveries regarding this unit, enough that my previous attempts at writing a review were no longer satisfactory. In a nutshell, this is actually a very decent GPS navigator with a generous feature set and a few minor quirks. One of this navigator's greatest strengths is the level of support they receive when a problem is reported.<br /><br />Up to this point I have used a TomTom Start as my primary navigator and my wife uses a Garmin Nuvi. Both of these units have their strengths and weaknesses, but both navigate well and do a good job of selecting routes. I have always been curious about Magellan GPS navigators so I was pleased to get the opportunity to do a side-by-side comparison with the Garmin and the TomTom.<br /><br />Right off the bat, the Magellan maps look a lot more simplistic and basic compared to the Garmin and TomTom maps. Where Garmin and TomTom have opted for more colorful and polished-looking road maps, Magellan uses much more simple graphics when it comes to the maps. At first I looked at the Magellan's maps with disappointment, but as I have used them I realized that there is an advantage with their approach. Because the maps show the roads as more basic, single-color and narrow pathways, the maps are actually less cluttered, making them easier to read.<br /><br />I ran into a serious issue with the Magellan when I was trying it out during the first few days. Navigation was reasonable but the position showed me at roughly 10 yards behind my actual location, regardless of the direction of travel. Unable to find a calibration option, I contacted technical support. I got very immediate assistance and was walked through a procedure that was supposed to reset the unit, and what it did was more of a hard reboot. After several emails back and forth my issue was resolved and the navigator now tracks accurately. I am very pleased with Magellan's support - highly professional and very eager to make things right.<br /><br />So, with the accuracy issue out of the way I mounted the Magellan next to the TomTom and the Garmin and went for a drive along a known route I frequently take. All three navigators tracked the same, though I observed something interesting regarding the Magellan. The Magellan marks position with a blue triangular icon and the others use a cartoony icon that can be selected from a palette of choices. With the Magellan, actual position is the top point of the triangle, but with Garmin and TomTom the position is the center of the icon. Even more interesting is that, because of the roads being represented as more narrow at all zoom levels, the Magellan is more likely to show slight inaccuracy while the others show the same location and appear more accurate due to the wider road representation.<br /><br />There are a number of features that the Garmin and TomTom have that the Magellan does NOT have, though these are more personal preference options more than functionality options. Magellan has one voice - period. If you do not like the Magellan voice the only option you have is to mute it. Also, there is no option for changing the icon that represents the current location, it will always be a blue triangle. Garmin and TomTom also have content communities for upgrades where Magellan does not.<br /><br />Of the three navigators, the Magellan has the very best mounting bracket and suction cup. Attaching it to the window is quick and easy and removing it is almost just as easy. Like any other mounting cup, it does not do so well when the window is very cold, so if mounted on a cold windshield it can suddenly let go and fall.<br /><br />For my particular car, the Magellan's car charger is all but useless, due to the size of the plug and the placement of the 12V outlet. That said, because the Magellan has a standard mini-USB plug it can be used with a typical USB cable and a 12V-to-USB adapter. This is the configuration I use and it has worked out well. I did notice that the Magellan does not necessarily charge completely when it is plugged in and operating simultaneously.<br /><br />Magellan's navigator offers four routing options: Shortest Distance, Fastest Route, Most Use of Freeways and finally Least Use of Freeways. These vary in usefulness, the first two being by far the most helpful to most people. When using Shortest or Fastest I have found the routing to be very sensible most of the time, though the routes usually differ just a little bit from what my TomTom offers up. I have not mapped out a route by hand to see which is more accurate but I believe them to be roughly equivalent.<br /><br />I decided to try &#34;Least Use of Freeways&#34; for a 45-mile one-way trip. The route offered up was reasonable but because of the traffic at that time of day I knew better than to take that specific route so I took another way. The Magellan then continuously told me to make a U-turn until I was probably 5 miles from the turn I skipped, after which it finally calculated a new route - way out of my way and making little sense. It recommended turns going farther from my destination, continuously trying to steer me back to whatever route it had chosen. I finally got on the freeway for a three-mile stretch, and it recommended I take the very first exit (west-bound) followed by a U-turn, when what I needed was the east-bound exit maybe 0.1 mile further down the interstate. After the exit, it tracked just fine. To make matters worse, every route after that seemed to have some quirky turns in it regardless of the method I chose for routing. I finally reset the unit using the suggestions that technical support had made earlier, after which the navigator has been just fine. Bottom-line: the Least Use of Freeways routing is not very good.<br /><br />Probably the biggest weakness of this navigator is the software used to interface with the unit. Content Manager, which can be downloaded directly from Magellan's website, is a rather unintelligent application that provides basic connectivity to the GPS unit, with a poor interface and the inability to recognize that an update was made already without requiring a relaunch of the software. It continuously tells me that there is a map update when it says I have the current version. Magellan could have done a much nicer job with the software.<br /><br />The actual interface on the navigator itself is very well thought-out and designed. It is very much icon-driven and it shows a little more polish and refinement than that of Garmin or TomTom. Hiding in this interface is a good amount of functionality - access to POI databases, traffic camera alerts, &#34;phantom&#34; alerts, navigation by landmark instead of by street name and many, many more features. Magellan got something important right with their interface - it is very uncluttered and clean, making it a lot less distracting while driving.<br /><br />One feature of which I was completely unaware revealed itself on my commute home one afternoon. My unit did not come with traffic alerts. When I reached the portion of my commute that requires access to the interstate, traffic came to an abrupt stop. Without prompting, an icon popped up on the Magellan screen, offering three alternative routes. I had no clue the Magellan would do that since I did not get traffic alerts, but the feature is very much welcome, regardless.<br /><br />The Magellan 2220-LM GPS navigator is a nice unit with a good feature set. It is different than Garmin and TomTom navigators and some of those differences really set it apart in good ways. Support is outstanding. The software used to interface with it is acceptable though could be better. I think this is a fine unit that will serve the owner well. If you're looking for a good, basic navigation system at a reasonable cost, this is a unit that is worth a look."
AFLX66DKF6R3H6OEOC3TIVAYXZIQ,B0052D5BY0,5,28,True,"I recently purchased one of these laptops when I stumbled on it here at Amazon. I was very much attracted by the price but was a little wary - this was one of very few laptops with an Intel Core i7 CPU in its price range so I was unsure what compromise might have been made to drive down the price. After working with it and really getting to know it, I can say there were few compromises made - this is an all-around awesome laptop at a really, really good price (as I write, $799). There are a couple of minor things I personally would change but these come down to preference.<br /><br />I will start with something that no one else online seems to mention when describing this laptop - the screen. From reading the specifications to digging around on the manufacturer's website I could find precious little regarding the screen beyond the dimensions. It's the glossy type, so please keep this in mind when shopping for a laptop. Some people prefer a matte finish on the screen to cut down on reflections so if a glossy screen is a problem then this laptop might not work for you. Personally, I like the glossy type of screen as it's easy to clean and since I work in a darker room most of the time I do not have issues with reflections. This laptop's screen is also very bright and clear, brighter than that of my Sony Vaio.<br /><br />Another very interesting feature of this laptop is the keyboard. It has a full number pad on the right side, slightly separated from the main keys. I like that. It also happens to be the chicklet-style keyboard which in my experience has been better at keeping stuff from getting in the keyboard.<br /><br />I made one unfortunate discovery when setting up this laptop - the power plugs into the middle of the left side of the case. That's a very awkward place for the power to be plugged in. What makes this particularly unfortunate is that the plug sits directly next to the output air vent where heat from the CPU dissipates. When not relying exclusively on the battery, make sure you move the cord in such a way to avoid that vent.<br /><br />This laptop has three USB ports, all of which are on the sides and close to the front. This may cause some issues, as both left- and right-handed users may struggle with external pointing devices when using this system. If using an external monitor this may be of no consequence but it's important to keep in mind.<br /><br />To my great joy, it is possible to turn the touch pad off completely. I dislike touch pads and on the occasions where I have to use the built-in keyboard I don't want to accidentally click on something or move the mouse pointer.<br /><br />One final thing I would have preferred to see when it comes to the hardware - a lid latch. I do move my laptop a lot and I would have liked a locking lid. That's purely a personal preference thing.<br /><br />My very first exercise with this system was to make restore media. This process was lengthy, taking about 2 hours and resulting in 4 single-layer DVDs. I then made a second set of restore media - something that some manufacturers expressly prevent users from doing. Once that was done I took a little time to explore the OS.<br /><br />The ""Windows Experience"" numbers reveal a lot about this system. As expected, the Aero graphics are the slow point, but still the number sits around 5.1. This is driven by the Intel graphics chipset and reflects the kind of usage that would occur under light-duty such as word processing or generating email. The gaming graphics, powered by the NVidia card posted much more respectable numbers. The second slowest number was for the hard drive, and considering that Asus puts a 5400rpm drive in these units this is not too shocking. It is easy enough to put a faster/bigger drive in, so I am not terribly concerned with this.<br /><br />There's a fair amount of vendor add-on software, most of which I am not likely to use. I was especially dismayed to see Trend Micro's security solution on there, a packages I personally dislike and will not use. Fortunately, stripping off all of the unwanted fluff is easy enough, but it represents a minor inconvenience.<br /><br />After contenting myself with the Windows side of things, I completely wiped the hard drive and loaded up Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. RHEL 6 is what I planned to run when I purchased this laptop anyway and it is where I can truly explore the system in detail.<br /><br />The Linux kernel reports eight cores as expected. Since the Core i7 is a hyperthreading quad-core, this is exactly what I hoped to see. It also reports the full 6GB of RAM.<br /><br />Boot-up time from pressing the power button to getting the log-in screen (under Linux using GNOME as a window manager) is less than 30 seconds. This is by far the fastest machine with which I have ever worked. Times would be even faster if the hard drive was a 7200rpm or an SDD-type, but it's plenty fast enough to please me.<br /><br />Overall, I am delighted with this laptop. It has a lot to offer for such a modest price and it definitely delivers on its promises. There are a few minor design issues that may or may not matter when using this system, but considering how much machine you get for the price it's hard to pass up in spite of a few minor complaints. This is a great system, worth more than the asking price."
AEUAL3EJKUSTNB4YY6STLYGTJALA,B00ZVJ9L3C,4,0,False,"At the time I received this remote with my new X1 box, it was the first ""smart"" remote we had in the household; I was fiddling with the remote, box, and TV for a whole night to soak in all the features. My favorite to this day is how intelligent the lighting is on the buttons; lift them slightly and the lights turn on, but remain off when lying still for a while.<br /><br />I haven't used the voice features after the initial night, so I can't comment on that. Everything still works great, and overall I find the button configuration pretty intuitive. I still confuse the Exit and Last buttons sometimes, so maybe some tweaking could be used between those two (if there hasn't been yet). But the main issue I have is how the power buttons don't work properly. When turning on both box and TV, the TV will turn on but the X1 box won't. It's been like that with two TVs. And when powering them off the TV will turn off but the box won't. I have to manually turn it off, which is a step more than I'd like but I've adjusted."

AEBEVCYY3HASVJ2Z5Q2Q36TENT2A,B00UOIK3FU,5,3,True,"Almost any good cooler will cool, but this one's just a bit cooler. Not only will it allow mounting in any of four positions on an Intel processor. It also allows mounting in any of four positions on an AMD processor. So, not only will it fit in the case, and clear the memory, and anything else that might be in the way. But, it can also provide airflow for the memory from directly above it. Many AMD-compatible coolers only allow mounting in one of two positions. This one allows mounting in all four using two different sets of brackets.<br /><br />Check the measurements on Cooler Master's site to be sure it'll fit your case. If it will, it's probably the best you'll find for AMD."

I have used it in a variety of settings: low light, indoors, super zoom, outdoors bright light, twilight/dusk shots, sports shots.  I have to say in every case I have been extremely disappointed at its performance.  The shots are not sharp.  If I take 5 identical shots in a row - the lighting looks different in each of them - which means.  Shot one the light may fine but kid isn't smiling.  Reshoot and kid looks great but lighting is off.  Take another shot - kid is fine but flash too bright.  Frustrating!!!  My biggest complaint is that the IA setting (the intelligent auto) is SOOOOOOO slow.  Most of my shots are of my kids and I keep missing shots.  I have used a compact digital point and shoot before - I am used to a delay but they delay on the Panasonic is painstakingly slow.  I read countless reviews and felt so confident purchasing this camera.  What a letdown!!!  I tried to return it to Amazon but I was 1 DAY past 30 day return window.  Darn!!!!

AHGUAZJBY4UJWO3PLS2NKCUBL2QA,B00NRMTC34,4,5,True,"...previous experience. This was my ex's old iPad that he gave to our son. I had bought him the black Beetle case and it lasted him for yearsssssss. He literally must have never cleaned it after our divorce, it was so gross when he gave it to our son - lol. I ordered the new case, letting my son pick the color, because the old case wasn't just nasty the screen cover was beyond scratched and scarred.<br /><br />The drawback of these cases is that they are nearly impossible to take off. My son is 23 but with the intellectual/cognitive abilities of about 2. He also has oral motor (swallow) issues. Drooling is a 'thing'. So I need to take the case off every few days to clean it well. I don't know how many fingernails I've ripped off; I don't want to use like a butter knife because I am sure it would slip and gouge me... this case is THAT hard to remove. ***BUT*** if you're not someone who needs to clean your iPad and case a lot (or has a case for every outfit - I've seen y'all!!

AFERCDY2EFJKT7QUQ75GISNHTFOQ,B07SGH132Y,5,9,False,"I have been in dire need of a new computer for a LONG time. My laptop is about five years old and takes about 10 to 15 minutes just to power up completely. I already have the use of a laptop from my workplace, so I don’t really need a replacement for it. What I need is a desktop computer to use when my laptop is still at work and this need was enough to convince me to get the HP Pavilion 24-inch All-in-One Computer, Intel Core i5-9400T, 12 GB RAM, 512 GB Solid State Drive with Windows 10.<br /><br />Taken out of the box, consumers will of course need to set this computer up and get it ready. I am happy to say that the set up is about as simple as it could possibly be- much simpler than the set up of other pc’s I have owned, which shows just how long it has been since I have gotten a new computer. In under 10 minutes, it was ready to use. It was so easy, I started to worry that I had forgotten something, but everything was good to go.<br /><br />This computer comes with a nice size screen- about 24 inches- which is the largest I have ever had in my house. It does make it easier to see things and I like watching videos and movies- something I didn’t like as much on my laptop, which had a screen about half as wide. The resolution and colors are good, too. I watched a few online videos and was impressed by how vibrant the different colors looked and how life- like people and faces appeared.<br /><br />Having a touch screen is cool and this is something new for me. I have never owned a touch screen computer before and while I like and support new technology, I admit that this is taking time to get used to. I still prefer to use my mouse out of habit, but this will likely change in due time. It really is much easier to simply touch a screen and it makes navigation faster.<br /><br />About the only issue I have with this computer is the fees charged for Microsoft Office. You get a free trial period, but after that, you will have to pay for the service. Considering the price of this computer, Microsoft Office should be part of the deal. I get that these companies need a regular revenue stream and charging for services was bound to happen but I still think it should have been an exception with this computer, given its higher than average cost.<br /><br />Getting rid of my laptop is a great relief. With my HP Pavilion 24-inch All-in-One Computer, Intel Core i5-9400T, 12 GB RAM, 512 GB Solid State Drive with Windows 10 computer, my power up time has been reduced to under one minute and I have a viewable screen that is much more vibrant than before. I’m still a little irritated with the whole Microsoft Office thing, but it’s not enough to lower my rating, which is an easy five stars for this excellent HP product."
AFCDHQQOOP6W2XFH7NAREBET6OZQ,B08164VTWH,1,9,True,I have gone through 2 of these in the last year. I don’t even play video games often and when I do it’s either Warzone or Dayz. Each CPU has had less then 400 hours on them and they keeping breaking. I’m not overclocked or any non sense. Don’t bother buying just go with an intel. They won’t replace your broken product either so enjoy a worthless chip.<br />You’ll love it until the very second it breaks and I assure you it will break. Absolutely livid!
AGQCFT47KDI77JKRSOMAK34MJPAQ,B073GVZTSQ,4,9,True,"*UPDATED*<br /><br />Update after living with this PC for half a year: Zero problems, fast, and works perfectly for my application (business use). And excellent value. VERY pleased with this purchase.<br />---<br /><br />The PC itself seems to be a great value, and is working fine thus far. The system is plenty fast. The HDD is a bit busy/noisy, and spins a bit more than it should, as though the system is caching to disk constantly. I'm not doing anything demanding with it at all--just light MS Office use and surfing. That's it. No gaming, no video editing, nothing heavy. Note this system is intended for business use, and could not handle much in the way of gaming or video editing, as it has no video card. The on-board graphics use the system's RAM, so anything asking a lot from the system's limited graphics capabilities will slow the entire system down immensely. Luckily, I outgrew DOOM years ago.<br /><br />The SFF case is heavy, but oddly a bit flimsy, with more flex than I had expected for the weight--especially the back panel--mine was oddly bent outward. I pushed it back in/straightened it (I had to in order to plug things in--the plugs were deeply recessed due to the bent real panel--very odd). The chassis itself is a joy to work with though, as the case pops open on hinges without turning a single screw--not even a thumbscrew, and everything is very accessible. The HDD's working vibrations and sounds are amplified by the plastic subframe the drive is mounted in, which acts like an amplifier for the vibrations. I worry a bit that the system's small case will have cooling issues. There just isn't much room in there, and there is only one small 3&#34; system ventilation fan (+ the power supply's fan, and a fan over the CPU). There are vents on the front and rear of the system, but I would like a lot more ventilation--I would have appreciated a perforated lid. Heat is the enemy of all electronics, and my other systems all have more ventilation than this box. Of course, this is an off-lease corporate desktop workstation, and is not designed to have the long life of other systems. The components in the box are the cheapest possible variants thereof, and I do not expect this system to last more than 3-4 years at the most. That said, $269 for a branded Lenovo PC with a 3.2GHz Intel Core i5, 12GB of RAM and a 2TB HDD is a fantastic value. If it dies in 3 years, I will have gotten my money's worth.<br /><br />Important note about the packaging: it simply was not enough protection. I guarantee the system took some hard knocks on its way to me. The UPS driver actually dropped it at my feet from a height of 1'--not kidding! The system is not packaged in an inner box within the shipping carton--the carton IS the box. The small Styrofoam corner blocks used to float the system inside the box are unusually rigid, so much so that they provide little in the way of cushioning, and one of them had cracked in half--meaning the PC wobbled around in the box during shipping. Also, the carton was sealed with &#34;Microsoft Certified Refurbisher&#34; packing tape, making it clear to all it contained a PC. They need to change the packaging--a desktop system simply needs more/better protection than this. I half expected it to be DOA due to the abuse it took on the way here from Arizona."
AG3S4FROO422V5KP7DJCBXVUQLJQ,B00ITIIE2Q,5,15,False,"When I first received a review sample I was dismayed because the specs claimed that it would only fit batteries that are between 42 and 71 millimeters in length. In inches that works out to be 1.65 to 2.79 inches.<br /><br />In actual fact, that dimension should have read width instead of length because my long Samsung Galaxy Note 3 battery (which is in excess of three inches long) not only fit, but charged perfectly. I also tested this on an HTC Driod Incredible and it worked perfectly on that phone's battery as well. There is a spring-loaded arm that opens to accept batteries with widths within the range I cited above, and they hold the battery firmly in place during the charging cycle.<br /><br />What I love is the ability to charge a spare battery while simultaneously charging a phone with a battery installed. That feature makes this perfect as a travel charger (the folding prongs add to the function for that use. It is also ideal as an office charger for folks who frequently spend most of their work day in the field.<br /><br />Do heed the two prominent notices in the specs (1) it is ONLY for phone batteries, and (2) it will only work with batteries that have contact points on the end (not the front of back). Indeed, the contacts on your battery (the metal strips that mate with your phone) cannot be closer than 3/8 inch from the edge of the battery, nor more than 5/8 inch away. If they fall outside of that range then this charger will not work for you.<br /><br />For batteries that do fit this charger will automatically detect the type and capacity and charge it properly. So there is some intelligence built into the circuitry.<br /><br />These are great for those of us who have spare batteries for our phones and want to keep them charged and ready to go. It worked perfectly on the phones with which I tested it. Measure and examine your battery before ordering to save disappointment."

I have had a chance to use it on my Fuji S5 Pro, a Nikon D7100...  but I am most happy with the results I'm getting on my Nikon D750. There is an intelligent mode that allows the camera to identify a Dx lens and use a crop factor that eliminates the vignetting. If I only had a full frame sensor, I would still consider this lens (nothing you can't fix with a little cropping and processing)  So far I have not had any focus issues that would require the re-programming puck. I don't leave home without a tripod.  The mono pod in this &#34;kit&#34; is more like a selfie stick... Not something I will ever use. I would use a heavier Manfrotto mono pod  for more stability with a combo this heavy. The Vivitar filter kit is adequate.. but I have upgraded to a Hoya CPL as I believe a lens like this should get a high quality filter. It also works flawlessly with a Kenko1.4x DGX teleconvertor with just a slight loss of f-stop.  The quality is beyond what I expected...already thinking about another Sigma Art lens in the wide angle arena.  For a big tele I will stick with my Nikkor lenses vs the Sigma."

There is no software fix whatsoever. Many people are complaining of this issue on boards over at Intel and other places.<br /><br />The only fix is to either never ever turn off your TV, or always turn off your computer when you turn off your TV, or fool the computer into thinking there is that HDMI monitor connected even when said monitor is powered off.<br /><br />I bought this ConnectPRO for just this purpose...and it works.<br /><br />Out of the box I did not get a green light, per the instructions. The light was orange, which implies it had a memorized EDID from the factory.<br /><br />I reset the box and cloned the EDID from my TV.<br /><br />I can now leave my computer on always if I desire and turn off my TV at any time, and no more problems.<br /><br />Sad that Microsoft never offered their own software fix via an update, in spite of the fact they confirm the issue, which forced me to have to spend an extra $70."

My specific circumstance: I wanted a computer to put next to my High-Def TV so I can play movies and TV shows, etc. My TV becomes the gorgeous computer monitor via the HDMI input. I have Ethernet right there, so I did not have to buy the additional WiFi adapter for the computer. I use a wireless keyboard and mouse.<br /><br />This Asus has 4 USB 3.0 ports. I recommend this Asus model with the 4 ports instead of their model with only 2 ports.<br /><br />I bought one 8-Gig RAM stick for $44 (Crucial CT102464BF160B via Amazon). I bought a 256GB mSATA drive for $103 (Crucial MX200 via Amazon). (I already had a wireless mouse [Logitech M525] and a wireless keyboard [Anker A7723].)<br /><br />So, I spent about $435 total.

I love the way it looks through the case's side window and it is so quiet and smooth.  The installation was easy enough, anyone with mechanical ability should have no trouble and the chrome and polished metals are great and give it a much better appearance than most cpu coolers.  I was surprised when I first saw the box, it is not as big as I expected.  Though not small it is not huge and doesn't feel like a brick in your hand.<br /><br />I think other coolers available could keep temps a bit lower but mine are fine.  I keep my 2500 overclocked to 4.2 and it idles at 42c and under load gets up to about 60c on a hot day.  I don't believe in ""burn-in"" or ""stress"" testing but would expect core temps to near or pass 80c during such tests.<br /><br />I also love that it is from Intel - who better than them to know what their processors need?<br /><br />I would recommend this fan to all except possibly severe gamers who need every bit of cooling they can get."

After 3 weeks of daily use, I have not experienced anything that seems like an improvement.  I develop websites using Adobe Dreamweaver and MS Expression Web with lots a graphic content and have managed fine (OK) on my previous system except that it wore out. (I guess, hard drive failure, DVD drive failure, motherboard, one after another.)  This system also comes with Windows 10, which I hate a lot. A joke!  Maybe that's a contributing factor to my totally unimpressive more expensive, less capable new computer.  Bottom line, the fastest processor and faster DDS RAM and solid state drives don't seem to add any power or performance so save your money and look for a Windows 7, Intel i5 if you can find one.  Sometimes, you don't get what you pay for.. I wish I could have a 'do-over' but I have work to do with my so, so OK new computer."
AGQ44R7LQ3HY5RBIQQ645Y4DFDEQ,B00KGEXXOK,5,7,True,"For its size and price, this is an amazing little device. This thing is tiny and pretty easy to conceal. I only wish it came with some type of bracket to help mount in a vehicle. It has a very strange shape and some grooves on the side which appear like they were designed for some type of bracket to slide into. Ultimately, I will probably make something.<br /><br />Video quality on the highest quality is amazingly good. It even does pretty well in low light conditions. Better than some similar devices I've tried. It has some default modes that will work without the widget, but you pretty much need to download and use it to take advantage of all its features. The widget seems pretty well designed and is fairly intuitive. I've had no problems using it. Audio could be better and in some situations it works pretty well, while other time its almost unintelligible. I believe this is just the nature of the little pinhole mike pick up. Results will vary based on the situation. I have found that sometimes the audio appears out of sync, but I'm not sure that doesn't have something to do with playback software. On the best quality, the files are pretty big and it will keep a processor busy watching the video.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great little package that includes cables, power pack and just about everything you'll need except the mini SD card. Some of the earlier mini DVRs were poor quality and lacked features as well as cost a lot for the size convenience. This device takes the mini DVR to a whole new level that is light years beyond some of the earlier stuff. Having tried many other little minis, I can say that this just blows them all away and clearly has been developed to a much more advanced level.<br /><br />Once you have played with it for awhile, you'll find endless uses. With a bit of creativity, concealment is pretty easy and battery life is quite good."
AF2BLE54TEMGZ546U763ZHZRXC4A,B09L3KD5L2,5,8,False,"This review is for the 12th Generation Intel Core i3-1215U w/ Intel UHD graphics<br /><br />I like it so much that I would buy this again if I didn't already have a high performance gaming desktop, and a new lap top of similar specs to this Dell All in One. Know what you need your computer for. No fair in comparing it to a high end system required for gaming and huge programs when it is designed for home office use. This is excellent for typical web browsing, youtube watching, solitaire/mahjongg playing, video calling, office basics. It is plenty enough memory and processing power for shopping and watching cat videos. It's lovely. Would I try to run an MMO-RPG or a huge photo editing studio on it? Probably not.<br /><br /> I love it though, it is gorgeous, responsive, and I love the touch screen. It feels so intuitive. However, I got it with my mom in mind as she hasn't had an actual computer in several years (been living off tablet only).  I set it up very quickly. Very easy.<br /><br />Some observations off top of my head:<br /><br />--The legs of the stand just snap on. Very sturdy, and attractive.<br /><br />--The wireless keyboard just takes three AAA batteries (included) NO DONGLE REQUIRED. Just turn on, and it instantly pairs with the computer. As for the mouse, it takes one AA battery (Inlcuded) and uses a usb dongle. Also needs to be switched to on position.<br /><br />--Windows 11, has many of the typical bells and whistles. Free Disney+ for 6 months (no idea of what is expected for that, I didnt check into it other than seeing the icon on the desktop)<br /><br />--Very quiet. Is it on? is it off? very quiet.<br /><br />--Love the white and silver appearance. Nice change from black. While I dont mind what color the computer is, my mom always preferred a lighter color for use on her large kitchen counter. This fits that need. Clean looking motif.<br /><br />--Touch screen is just way too cool. I havent had experience yet with using a desktop with a touch screen. It just feels so intuitive. Just touch the screen to make things happen. LOVE!<br /><br />--Web Camera is a ""pop up"" out from the topside of the monitor. So you will know if it is on or not. I like this for that reason, and it makes the overall appearance look nice and clean. But since it is an extra part of the sort, it brings to mind chance of breakdown. Just press down and it pops up. Takes picture and video as expected. Resolution of both is typical. Clear but nothing fancy.<br /><br />--Sound is fine, visuals are fine.<br /><br />--Built in card reader, 2 HDMI ports, 4 USB ports, 1 USB C port, Ethernet port, 1 audio port<br /><br />--Good amount of weight-- it feels secure. At no point did I feel like it was going to move, or tip over.<br /><br />--Screen tilts back or forward. I found this nice as it is sitting on a large kitchen counter, and sometimes it will be used while standing, and other times with butt parked on a bar stool.<br /><br />--Keyboard tucks in between legs for cleaned up look.<br /><br />--Information that comes with it is sparse. Very basic start instructions (I didnt need), warranty info (detailed), and a card that provides directions on downloading a Dell app for added assistance and information. I thought maybe a PDF would be available on this product page or on their website, but I didnt see one. I will have to try their app and see what sort of info is available. I really wont need it myself, but I want to make sure my mom has access to info.<br /><br />Overall, it wasnt hard for me to conclude that this is a nice computer. It will take more time with it to truly see how it does. For that, I will come back to update if/as needed. My instant love of the touchscreen and how responsive everything is made me a little envious. At this time, I would recommend it. If you find you might want to spring for a little more hard disk size, then they also offer a 512 GB with 8 gig memory. This has 256 GB hard disk with 8 gig memory.<br /><br />Going with 5 stars as it meets or exceeds my expectations. Again, know what you want this for and choose accordingly.

Doesn't say this anywhere in the listing, so it was a pleasant surprise for my kid. You find this out during the process of setting up the laptop.<br />* Advertised for gaming, but hardcore gamers will find it a little light. But for a child using it as a school laptop, this is perfect. Much better than the Chromebooks, and for Roblox and Minecraft, which is all my kid does, this is more than enough.<br />* Nevertheless, if you want to boost the ram and ssd, you'll need to know how to remove the bottom cover. Search YT for, ""Lenovo IdeaPad Gaming 3i (15"", 2022) - disassembly and upgrade options."" Click on the very top search result. The video is by LaptopMedia. They disassemble several similar models, but this is the term you want to search to get to the exact model. However, keep in mind that he's disassembling the intel version which uses DDR4 ram, you'll be using DDR5 for this Ryzen model.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* Screen is only 1080P.<br />* Ram is only 8GB, but again, you can upgrade this.<br />* If truly using for gaming, you'll need more than 256GB. My son will mainly use it for school, so this won't be an issue.<br />* No touchscreen.<br />* Regarding power supply... Not necessarily a bad, but a tip. If you have children, then you know when they take their tablets and notebooks to relatives or friend's house, the power supply goes too. Instead of constantly unplugging the one that is supposed to be stationary at their table, I always buy a second power supply. For this model, it's a 170W with the Lenovo rectangle usb head. You can buy any 3rd party, just make sure it's 170W with the rectangle head.<br /><br />Despite listing some items in the bad list, I understand it's par for the course in terms of the price you're paying.

AHR6RGZTLOMBD7EBF3OK43JWMGNQ,B09TQ46KJL,4,92,False,"THE GOOD:<br />--------------<br />* I won't go through the specs because you already know from the product listing.<br />* Beautiful picture quality, but I'm not a videophile. This is for my bedroom, and I'm coming from a TCL 65R613, which is a great budget tv.<br />* TV has a layer of film covering the entire screen, allowing you to get your finger prints on it while you set-up. Then when you're finished, peel it off.<br />* Comes with accessories for placing the Samsung on a table. The base is extremely heavy duty and weighted.<br />* You can wall mount using your own brackets, which is what I did.<br />* The remote is very unique. It has a solar back. I've never seen this before. So it will charge by light, or by usb-c. The fact that you don't need alkaline batteries is a first for me.<br />* Smart Home interface has a lot going on. There will be a little learning curve, but this could potentially replace my Fire TV Cube.<br />* Voice recognition allows you to choose between Bixby, Alexa, or Google Assistant. That's very nice of them to not force Bixby on you.<br />* No dark corners, which were present in my TCL. If there are, they are imperceptible. Dark corners are a hallmark of budget tvs. I'm definitely stepping up in picture quality.<br /><br />THE BAD:<br />------------<br />* This is just something superficial, but I'm not in love with Samsung's build. This may be subjective, but I really love TCL's design. I have a picture comparing the side profile between the two tvs. The Samsung has a 3/4"" side profile, but it's misleading, it's not really 3/4"" thin, it has a hump back, which is all plastic btw, so the entire width is really 2"". Whereas my TCL has a side profile of 1-1/8"" all around. It's amazing that they can make a TV that thin all around, and the brush metal on the TCL looks better too.  What I'm saying is that, aesthetically, this isn't the best TV out there when my budget TCL can beat it in looks. Then again, like I said, this is subjective.<br />* Picture Presets are: Dynamic, Standard, Movie, and Film Maker Mode. They are all underwhelming besides for Dynamic which is the brightest and has the most pop. I can tweak them all except for Standard. Something is wrong with the Standard preset right now. It is less bright than Dynamic, but once you choose it and exit the menu, it becomes even dimmer, much more dimmer than what was previewed to you. If you go back to the setting to see if you can up the brightness, you'll see that it's already at 50, which is the brightest. There is something wrong with this Standard preset, hopefully a firmware can fix this. I just use Dynamic.<br />* Smart Home navigation lag. Not sure if this can be fixed with firmware, I hope it can. The remote is pretty sweet, but lag can make or break whether or not you stick with an O.S. Right now, I still prefer to go to my Fire TV Cube. Hopefully, with firmware updates, they can improve the OS navigation and convert me.<br />* The storage in this TV I'm guessing is 8GB. Because after downloading a few apps, as well as the apps they force you to have, it says I've used about 3.5GB, and I have less than 2GB of space left. Why do TV makers continue to go cheap on this? They plaster you with all these apps in their home, all these ads, they want you to download games, this and that... yet they give you a measly 8GB, half of which is already used up for the OS and their forced bloatware, which you cannot delete. And I'm wondering if this has anything to do with the lag. It's truly comical sometimes, the decision making process of a multi-billion corp.<br /><br />HOW TO GET RID OF THE SOAP OPERA EFFECT:<br />--------------------------------------------------------<br />* Wow, I spent a long time trying to figure this out. YT tutorials say turn off ""Picture Clarity Settings"" would turn this off, but it had no effect. I had this issue with the TCL too, when you make these adjustments, sometimes the TV just doesn't respond. The trick for the TCL was to unplug the tv, then replug and the motion clarity would be eliminated. I tried that trick with this Samsung, and it still didn't work. Ultimately, I found out turning off PICTURE CLARITY doesn't work, so you need to set it to CUSTOM, then turn off everything one by one, especially the BLUR and JUDDER reduction.<br /><br />1. From your Home, go to MENU on the left side bar.<br />2. Then go to Settings, then ALL SETTINGS.<br />3. Go to PICTURE.<br />4. Choose your picture mode, I like DYNAMIC.<br />5. Then go to EXPERT SETTINGS.<br />6. Scroll down to PICTURE CLARITY SETTINGS.<br />7. Change it from Auto to CUSTOM.<br />8. Then reduce the Blur Reduction to 0.<br />9. Then reduce the Judder Reduction to 0.<br />10. You can also set the ""Noise Reduction"" to OFF, instead of AUTO. I can't tell the difference with noise reduction off. It's not like all of a sudden, your tv looks grainy. The difference is imperceptible, so I leave it off. Because a little noise makes the movies look more like theatre quality.<br /><br />* Another tip I have is to NOT use ""intelligent mode."" If you enable this, it over-rides your custom settings above, and it will turn on the soap opera effect as it pleases.<br /><br />Overall, I'll give this tv 4-Stars! Knocking a star for the navigation lag issue. I'm just using my Fire TV Cube for the moment. Hope this review has been helpful."

This Kamrui CK 10, though...<br /><br />On paper, the specs of this computer is impressive.  A 10th generation i7 processor with the integrated Intel graphics which I already knew wouldn't be winning any awards in the gaming department but that's expected.  With 16 GB of ram and 512GB of nvme storage, this computer is a good starting point for anyone who needs a fairly powerful PC in a compact package.<br /><br />Regarding the ram:  I've disassembled this computer and found that the ram is soldered to the motherboard, as is the CPU.  This means there is no way to upgrade the ram.<br /><br />Regarding the storage:  There is good news here.  There are two M.2 slots supporting NVME so SSD storage is quite expandable.  I installed another 512gb ssd in the secondary slot.<br /><br />The operating system that was included was a vanilla Windows 11 Pro with absolutely no additional bloatware aside from what Microsoft has already included.  This is good.  All drivers were installed and the machine booted fine.<br /><br />So in my case, it is customary for me to install Windows from scratch when I buy a new computer.  It's just something I do.  I don't trust that there are no hidden software in the preinstalled systems.  As such, I needed to locate the necessary drivers for this computer.<br /><br />As expected, Windows will successfully detect the graphics, wifi and bluetooth hardware.  Also as expected, the Intel chipset drivers needed to be installed manually.  All standard so far.  With all of this done, there were three pieces of hardware that were unidentifiable.  These were the sound drivers.<br /><br />Scouring the search engines, I couldn't find the drivers for the CK 10.  I finally located Kamrui's facebook page, which led to a linktree that then led me to their forums.  In the forums, I searched and found a set of drivers for the CK 10.  Unfortunately, that seems to be for the CK 10 with an i5 cpu.  It did not contain the correct drivers for the sound card.<br /><br />I resorted to searching for the drivers by device id.  From there, I pieced together the necessary drivers to get sound working.  I had to use drivers from three different driver sets from HP.<br /><br />I did reach out to Kamrui's support email.  They responded two days later but rather than read what I wrote, they responded with a canned form for me to list my product, serial, purchase date, etc.<br /><br />So what else is wrong?  Well, at least twice per day, this computer freezes without warning.  It could be caused by the sound drivers that I had to piece together but how would I know?  I don't can't actually get the right drivers for it."

In truth, the Type-C port is a huge mess.  There are so many functions that the port is designed for that a normal consumer would have a hard time understanding all of them.  In my case, the type-c port on my computer doesn't support HDMI video output.  This port came in handy with its Displaylink technology.<br /><br />As a dock, the iVANKY 15 in 1 Triple Display dock is a great product that, if your laptop has USB charging capabilities, can connect all of your external devices with just one USB plug.  You can connect multiple external monitors, external USB drive, your keyboard/mouse, and gain the ability to read SD and MicroSD cards, all with a single plug.  In terms of charging, the PD port outputs 18W of power which is good enough for fast charging your tablet and phone, and the computer port outputs 94w, powerful enough for many laptops running a CPU up to an Intel i5.  All this is packaged in a modern, metal shell and it even has a 100w power adapter included.<br /><br />Already, this is a great dock, but the DisplayLink feature sets this dock apart from the rest of the pack.  DisplayLink allows a computer to output video to a computer monitor (up to 4K) through a standard USB 3.1 port.  This means that if you have a type-c that doesn't support video output or if it only has Type-A ports, this dock can still give you the ability to add more monitors to your setup.  Just install the included drivers (the dock shows up as a computer drive when you plug it in) and this dock will extend your desktop.<br /><br />While it is a little pricey, this dock has the quality and functionality to justify it."

For a while, I really did use recharged alkaline batteries exclusively and kept my Ni-MH batteries in the drawer.  What I found was that I needed to change the batteries a lot more often and I couldn't be sure that the battery would have a charge when I took it out of the drawer.<br /><br />Leaking is a big problem.  My charger now has one charging port that is stuck because the liquid got in to the spring mechanism and dried.  I also have a couple of remotes and devices that had to be cleaned out because the batteries leaked.<br /><br />In the end, I had to give up on the idea of recharging cheap alkaline batteries because of how long it takes to recharge and that it can leak at any time, potentially ruining your device (mostly, it's just oily and you need to clean it out with a tissue).  I  just couldn't trust those batteries.<br /><br />So why did I still give this charger 5 stars?  Although alkaline charging was a failed experiment for me, the charger is still a better-than-average Ni-MH battery charger.

I’ve consulted on large projects and written about security vulnerabilities within networks for trade publications.<br /><br />This is a field I know well.  Over the years the technology has improved and become less and less expensive to produce.  It is now practical to install security systems that would have only previously been used in commercial settings in residential.<br /><br />As with all security systems my advice is never use cloud based recording - this opens your entire network to not only the company who you are giving blanket access too but also to hackers.  The same is true for WiFi.  Obviously WiFi is more convenient but if your privacy is a concern this really needs to be taken into account.  Hackers have become quite adept at hacking into WiFi cameras and being able to not only watch your feed but control your cameras and access your entire network.

I love Windows on a Tablet, I've been a fan ever since the original Lenovo Yoga convertibles and Microsoft Surface tablets went mainstream.<br />The only problem I've had with those Windows tablet concepts is that sometimes you encounter applications that were designed for a mouse and keyboard rather than a touch screen. And that's what makes Windows 11 so great: You can finally run Android Apps thanks to built in virtual machine support. This is the first time I'm trying a Windows 11 Tablet, and I have to admit there's some initial setting up to do to get Android app support working (you can't just download an APK like I was expecting to). But once you do, it's pretty awesome and works the way I imagined and expected!<br />I'm not familiar with the brand Alldocube, but I have to admit the iWorkGT is actually pretty solid, has good build quality and an excellent display for the money. Since you are running an actual X86 Intel CPU, you're going to get a powerful experience compared to an anemic ARM processor like a traditional tablet would have, but the trade off is it will need to cool itself off like a laptop sometimes. That means vents and fans, which you will feel in your hands.<br />And this leads me to the cons:<br />There is NO CASE included with this product in the box. And since it is not a major brand like the Microsoft Surface, finding third party cases are going to be difficult if not impossible. Alldocube does sell 2 keyboard style cases which are interesting, however they are sold separately and not cheap! Sure, this is a lot less than a Surface, but at least a surface has plenty of after market cases and holders for every style and budget. I can't help feeling like it should have come with at least some sort of basic protection case. Even the Surface at least gives you the kickstand to stand it up, with this you have a portable computer that can get warm in your hands and nothing to really hold it in or stand it up with. You NEED to purchase one of their cases here.<br />The other con is that I did notice some strange behavior at times- the tablet wouldn't charge the first time I used it until I turned it off and rebooted. Another time the sound didn't work, and also wouldn't come back until I rebooted. That second time could have been due to the Android virtual machine being set up (it was right after trying it for the first time) and hasn't come back since, but I feel like it is worth mentioning sometimes there are quirks. But overall my experience has been positive and I enjoy using it, I just really strongly recommend getting one of their keyboard cases."
AGDSEYGSA5K664EUHWKV3ARDXO2Q,B09V2GMFGS,4,4,False,"I love mini PCs and I've collected a few of them for different projects. The Celeron chip isn't a speed demon, but combined with Intel's GPU it is fast enough to drive 2 HDMI displays quite well, and like most other mini PCs out there, it has enough RAM and storage for light media consumption and internet tasks.<br />But there are few things that stand out with this model:<br />- This one is FANLESS. Without moving parts whirring, this actually manages to stay completely quiet while running.<br />- Also since the body is the heat sink, it doesn't need space for airflow and is therefore more compact as well.<br />However, not all of those changes are positive:<br />- There is no upgrade option for the storage like other mini PCs. Some of the popular boxes out there have an access door to add your own sata SSD drive for additional storage. This does not.<br />- The fanless design also sometimes means that in hot environments (such as attached to the back of a large TV display sign), there is no way to cool itself off other than throttling the processor. Most of the time this doesn't mean anything, but like all fanless computer designs it is extremely possible the unit will need to slow itself down to prevent overheating if used for extended periods of time. A fan unit has alternative ways to cool itself off at least.<br /><br />But the biggest disappointment to me personally, is the lack of USB type C ports. It looks like this has one, but that look is deceiving. The port is just a PD input to run the unit. I actually like that it is using a standard instead of the circular DC ports that other mini PCs use, the PD power port is plentiful these days and you can use most laptop and other standard PD chargers to run this device. However, it still does not work as a standard USB-C for peripherals that are compatible with one. To be fair, most of these mini PCs I've tried oddly lack a type C port as well. I can't really detract any stars for that, but I got excited for a moment that this would have one only to see it is the power port."
AGDSEYGSA5K664EUHWKV3ARDXO2Q,B09M6LCFNT,4,1,False,"First of all, don't trust the specs listed here. This is a great mini-PC, but the listing is confusing. I wouldn't say it's false as much as just sloppy. For starters, it says you get an 8 core i3. That's not true (and I'm not sure is even a thing to be honest). Don't expect desktop power and performance. In fact, this is an I3 8109U, which is a laptop-level CPU that has only 2 cores for efficiency. I think they meant to say GENERATION not core, since it is an 8th gen of the i3. But usually a desktop level i3 has 4 cores, and with hyperthreading you get 8 threads at a time. This has only 2, which gives you 4 with ht.<br />Either way, a far cry from the 8 in the title. Then there's the image comparing HDDs that tell you this has a 500gb Kingston SSD inside. That may be an option, but mine is configured 256. The picture on the listing still shows 500, which again... misleading.<br />Otherwise, I really do like this box. Confusing listing shouldn't take away from the experience if you know what you're getting. And you're getting an excellent device for a HTPC or digital signage / arcade box / etc. I'm actually a fan of Beelink's other products, having had one of their old Android TV boxes back in the day. This is great because it's smaller than even most mini-PCs that I've used, yet sports a mainstream Intel CPU with Windows 10, and a real kicker is that this one supports USBC. For some reason a lot of these mini PCs on the market have only traditional USB ports. A modern C port makes a lot of connections really simple and easy, using one port instead of many for the same things, and I'm so glad this has one.<br />All in all, I like it and would recommend it. It's great for light gaming (retro console / emulator), streaming media, and excellent as a desktop workstation for browsing / office documents. Not a powerhouse 8+ core machine that you might want for hardcore gaming or compiling code, video editing, etc. But good for most intermediate and under computing tasks. And did I mention it looks super cute?"
AGDSEYGSA5K664EUHWKV3ARDXO2Q,B099N5XSVG,5,4,False,"This is a great little mini computer that is only slightly larger than an external drive. It comes with a VESA mount so you can attach it to a screen or TV and use it for digital signage or a kiosk. I actually tested mine with a 15"" touchscreen and was able to turn it into a touch screen windows desktop, which was pretty neat.<br />It has a healthy dose of RAM, but not a lot of storage. No matter, as you can actually easily add storage with the included empty SATA bay. If you don't want to use the additional storage, this bay can actually be removed completely, leaving you with a much thinner PC!<br />Here's the bit that's even more interesting: That additional bay appears to connect via a USB-C connection on the bottom of the unit. Oddly enough, this box does not have user-accessible USB-C ports, only standard full sized USB A. The only USB-C seems to be this ""Secret"" one found on the bottom and only accessible if you remove the additional storage bay. Strange design, but still very functional for my intended purposes.<br />As far as being a computer, it boots pretty quickly thanks to the SSD main storage, but don't expect this to be a speed demon or 3D gaming computer by any sorts. The CPU is actually not all that impressive, nor is the integrated Intel GPU that comes with it. However, in my benchmark test using the User Benchmarks website, it actually performed ""better than expected"" according to their expectations based on the specs. Here's the results I got:<br />UserBenchmarks: Game 3%, Desk 29%, Work 3%<br />CPU: Intel Celeron J3455 - 27.3%<br />GPU: Intel HD Graphics 500 - 2.6%<br />SSD: Kimtigo 128GB 128GB - 68.7%<br />RAM: ABCD 123456789012345678 4x1.5GB - 28%<br /><br />The percentages are based out of all tested computers they have ranked. As you can see, for basic computing (Desk) it's decent, but for gaming or work (I'm guessing work means like compiling code or other heavy computational tasks), it's rated at 3% overall. But for light browsing, word processing, and running video (which it can do on dual monitors, thanks to the dual HDMI ports!), it's actually pretty good- much more capable and powerful than an Android based computer or Raspberry Pi, and runs the full desktop windows while at it!<br />Interested that the GPU is rated at 2.6%, the benchmarks claimed that this Intel HD 500 gpu is normally expected to perform around 1%, so the fact that it nailed a 2.6 percentile implies that this setup actually outperformed expectations for that chip.<br /><br />All in all, for the price, it's a pretty neat little computer that can be used for all kinds of interesting things."

To be fair, with these specs and price point I would have really liked a touch screen, but I supposed that's not the target market for this laptop. This is a workstation that you can fold up and take with you, not a gaming machine or touch friendly gimicky browser. This is for getting things done. 16GB of ram and the 10th generation i7 are pretty top mark for mobile specifications, and I love LOVE that this has an Ethernet jack. I actually have an older laptop that I use for live streaming setups attached to a pro camera, and I used to need a USB to ethernet adapter to get a solid internet connection (can't trust wifi for live streaming). This laptop will easily replace that, offering everything I need internally, and keep up better as well thanks to the more efficient CPU.<br />No, it doesn't have a GeForce GPU or anything like that, but the CPU is more than capable for things like video encoding and the gaming experience with the Intel Graphics is no slouch either! The webcam is just OK, it isn't as clear as modern phones or even higher end laptops, but it gets the job done. And that's the point of this laptop I think- getting the job done.

In fact, I'd have to say it seems to be on par with a wired connection to my router, which I'm thankful to NOT need to deal with (drilling holes and running cables, etc). I like that this came with the cables and external antenna all ready to go! The base of the antenna is magnetic and sticks nicely to my case for a good looking and extremely effective connection.<br />I also really REALLY like how this keeps my PC relatively uncluttered inside. This build has a glass window, so the lack of additional PCI cards combined with my NVMe hdd in the other M.2 slot of my motherboard makes a very clean looking install."
AGDSEYGSA5K664EUHWKV3ARDXO2Q,B07WQB1X3B,5,1,False,"So many things I love about these. These appear to be as rugged and well built as I'd expected from a brand name like Cobra. I love that they include a flashlight, and especially that the units are USB rechargeable! Such a convenient way to power things these days, I wish more electronics ditched the AAA batteries thing like this!<br />The range might be a bit exaggerated, but to be fair I live in a very wooded area surrounded by hills and valleys. I found that around my neighborhood it worked great but if I went a few miles away, the sound was mostly just unintelligible crackling. We could still hear that someone was trying to say something, but that's it.<br />On the flip side, we started hearing someone else's conversation the next day... we were just testing it so we didn't bother changing the default channel, and it turns out someone else must have gotten some talkies on the same default frequencies. I have no idea how close they were, but my kids pointed out that someone was talking and we didn't press any buttons and then we all heard it. ""Dad? Do I need to come in? I'm playing outside"", and then a few seconds later ""ok, but don't ride into the street"". Then some clicks of singing and other noises- clearly someone else communicating with THEIR kid was coming through to us. I pressed the talk button and said ""Hi- this is the default frequency for these walkie talkies, so we should both probably change them!"" and then promptly picked another channel. So, that's kind of neat because I have no idea where these other people were, we live in a pretty urban area with houses spread out and I know it wasn't someone from my block. Yet we heard them clear as day. So, I'd say these are pretty good at what they do, but maybe don't rely on the full extent of their listed range."
AGDSEYGSA5K664EUHWKV3ARDXO2Q,B07P3CH9XM,4,2,False,"As a freelance camera operator, I'm no stranger to these. This is clearly designed for us low budget video shooters using small DSLR style cameras, which is why it uses a Sony camcorder battery plate and designed with a hood for outdoor viewing. It has some pretty great features for the price point, including crop mark overlays, peaking indicators, and individual color channels. That being said, it can be used for all sorts of things, such as a Raspberry Pi monitor, backup camera screen, or even a second monitor for your laptop (that's a fun one!). It even has included sound, something a lot of these monitors do not, more on that later.<br />This is really designed for video use, and for that it does a pretty great job for the price. It comes with a hotshoe mount adapter to put on top of your camera, and uses standard batteries (most LED lights and other accessories also use these batteries, so you probably have some already if you work in video). The colors are vivid and sharp, more accurate than my Atmost Ninja 2 recorder screen, and nice and big for focus checking.<br />The hood is a nice touch as well, but it requires the snap on frame to attach, and the frame has a weird problem in which it partially obstructs the HDMI port. Maybe I'm just doing it wrong, but I found I needed to leave that corner off the frame if I wanted to use the HDMI plug.<br />Speaking of the HDMI plug, it comes with one included which I thought was pretty rad of them, but it isn't the more modern micro HDMI type, but the slightly older MINI one. That's the outdated kind that older devices use (such as 3rd generation Intel laptops or cameras like the GH2), but pretty much everything made in the last few years has been using the newer micro one. So it seems weird that they included this one. Personally, it will come in handy because I DO have a laptop that still uses that plug, but I don't intend to use it with this monitor. All my cameras that use that plug are long gone at this point.<br />Another couple of things to note: The focus peaking is pretty much useless. It oversharpens the image and thinks high contrast parts of bokeh are ""in focus"", which is weird. Thankfully my Sony cameras have peaking built in so that isn't much of an issue. Also, the screen is large enough and is HD enough resolution (not full 1080 but more than 720) that you don't really need peaking to tell what's in focus. You can see it with your eyes. Also, if using with a camera that is outputting a 16:9 image, you have to change the screen size setting from the default, which is to maximize the screen. Everything looked a little stretched because the display is a little taller than the output of my camera until I turned that off.<br />As far as sound, I mentioned earlier that this monitor has a speaker. That's good for when you want to review footage on the monitor, and even better if using with a Raspberry Pi or monitor for other things where it might be your only source of sound. It is also really useful if shooting with a Sony A6000 or similar smaller camera that doesn't have a headphone jack... this offers a headphone jack so you can monitor off the HDMI feed. That's pretty useful right there! But don't forget, when you turn the live view back on, you are going to get major feedback from the mic to the speaker unless you quickly turn the volume all the way DOWN first! Or just leave headphones in if that's how you roll.<br /><br />It is important to note however that it will not accept a 4k signal. The actual resolution is 1280x800, and it will accept up to 1080p as an input, but more than that fails. At the time I'm reviewing this, it seems that there are similar monitors that can accept a 4k input for around the same price. I'm guessing they are updated versions of the same design, as there are no monitors that actually have that resolution for this price, rather they just accept the feed and down-sample to 1280x800, just like this one. So at the end of the day, it probably won't matter if it accepts 4k or not. Some cameras don't like outputting a different resolution than they are recording, so if you are recording in 4k and outputting 1080p, that might be an issue. Otherwise, this is a solid value."

This is a perfect fit for that- performance is not the fastest on the market (Sandisk has other lines such as the extreme for that), but it is very respectable for an SSD in today's standards, and faster than my first-generation Intel SSD currently in my workstation. And if you're comparing to a mechanical HDD, we're not even in the same ballpark either way. These are FAST and solid. And I trust Sandisk a lot more than other brands out there.<br />In fact, I'm impressed enough with the quality-to-cost ratio that I might pick up another one to replace my workstation's older and smaller model.

AH7AMQEZQSI4LHJMA5URES2W6L4Q,B005404P9I,5,0,False,"Just a phenomenal cpu.  This is probably the best upgrade Ive done, coming from an i7 7700k. I had 30 days to use and figure out if I wanted to stay with this or go with the latest AMD cpu.<br /><br />Work- I used to have trouble running programs that were either too complex or inefficiently coded that it led to stutters, hitches, delays or freezes.  One program that always caused massive trouble for me over the years was the Think or Swim trading platform.  I originally upgraded to the i7 7700k and it could not handle more than 2-3 chart at a time running the time and sales and L2.  Run some side charts and you could forget about trading, especially at the open when calculations need to be run at an extremely rapid pace.  I even added a total of 32gb ddr4 3400 ram and it still wouldnt run properly.  Arguably, the program is encoded really inefficiently requiring much more from the CPU than necessary.  Ive tried many different trading programs and this one caused the most trouble.  After stepping up to the i9 9900k I can now run this inefficiently encoded program on my main chart screen, with two different tickers having 4 different time frames each with its own L2 and time and sales, PLUS 15 side charts without a hitch! Also im running my browser with at least 5 tabs open and video/audio running.  Absolutely amazing.  I never thought I could get it to work like this.<br /><br />Gaming- even if the cpu doesnt run at 100 pct it affects the quality of the experience of the gameplay, especially for demanding games, or just poorly coded, inefficient ones.  RPGs fall into these categories. I.e., Kingdom Come Deliverance.  Video and streaming is flawless as well.<br /><br />Vs AMD- Performance isnt always about raw numbers, if there are too many peaks and valleys, it affects the quality of the experience.  I havent personally compared it directly to the newest AMD cpu, but having looked at the side by side comparisons, AMD cpu seems to put out better numbers for work-related applications, but clearly on the gaming side, intel is superior.  From my observation, the quality of the experience with Intel was greater because the frame rate was consistent with much less, if any micro stuttering, which you can see with the AMD chips.  As a result, Intel's presentation was more effortless and smooth.  With the AMD setup, you can see some graying/discoloring/hazy effects in demanding scenes.  It seems like AMD is an overcharged chip that experiences these dips because of that, causing a deterioration in the experience. AMD is perfectly fine for work I presume, but not for me when it comes to gaming. Intel performs like a more refined, polished product.  This is just based on my personal observation of their performance in these two different areas.<br /><br />Overclocking- its perfectly fine using it the way it is.  No need to overclock, but of course you can overclock it.  I run mine 16 hours a day without any problems. Top recommendation at the asking price these days."

The ergonomic on this laptop are way better.I haven't accidentally bumped the touchpad while typing, and the keys are large with a nice feel. Performance.....well, I'm not gamer. It's doing ok on Photoshop, Lightroom and Chrome, and that's pretty much my big three. The backlit keyboard is something you'll never be able to live without once you've had it. The screen is gorgeous. It could, perhaps, be a touch brighter.  The sound from the speakers is ok. No one will confuse it with a surround sound system but it's good for a laptop.  The hard drive is quiet. The spinning of the one in the hP drove me mad. The USB ports are towards the back of the machine. I have not been a fan of the recent trend to move them up front as I'm forever bumping them. Great to see. Despite being larger than the HP, the power drain is MUCH lower. I live in a solar powered vehicle so this is important. Right now, with music playing and the screen at max, in high performance battery mode, I'm showing it using 17w. When I first plugged it and it wasn't fully charged yet, I saw a max draw of 29w. The HP drew almost 50w charging and 90 or better while running. I could not be happier with the Toshiba. The tablet mode thing......well, it's nice to be able to adjust the screen to any angle. Using it in tablet mode......I haven't found a lot of reasons to do that yet. It's pretty heavy and unwieldy to carry it around like an ipad at 5 pounds. But I guess it's nice to have the option. That brings me to another small quibble....it's kind of heavy for how thin it is. I was a little taken aback. I guess you can't have everything. Well, you can, but you'll pay two grand and up for it. For the $$ this is a great all around machine. I'm definitely not buying another Envy. Windows 10......boy, I was prepared to hate it. I don't. So far anyway. A lot of headaches can be avoided by setting your wifi connection to metered, then all those background updates don't happen as far as I can tell.  PS The stupid stickers they put all over these things came off with little effort and no residue. I hate those things. The Intel one put up a little fight but came off relatively easily."

AHMG3ALUBE3FEBHODTBHP5J24YDA,B07TL5QB92,5,7,False,"WARNING- this is an IN DEPTH REVIEW for those who are serious about making a purchase of this laptop.  All sections are marked for easier reference to find out information you might be looking for.<br /><br />If you prefer a simple summary, see section marked THE BOTTOM LINE<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For one of the top new computers out there, this laptop is amazing and frustrating at the same time.  Is it worth getting?  YES.  Are there warnings to be had?  YES. This started out as a nightmare, but Dell stepped up to the plate..  Let’s take a closer look.<br /><br />WHAT IS THIS LAPTOP LIKE?<br />SCREEN<br />The screen is large, easy to see, with clean colors and no pixel problems.  This screen rivals the IPS screen in appearance.  Gaming vid appears smooth.  All games have performed well with no lag or problem on the screen.<br /><br />HARD DRIVE<br />Start up is very short, and performance is FAST.  This loads really quickly and performs well so far.<br /><br />TOUCHPAD<br />The touchpad is responsive. The left and right mouse button are built into the bottom of the mousepad instead of individual buttons.  It’s not our favorite set up, but it isn’t bad.  When playing a game that uses keyboard, we have to turn off the touchpad because it is bigger than many other touchpads in laptops.<br /><br />KEYBOARD<br />Not only is the keyboard FUN with the light show it has(as well as being RGB enabled), but the keys are quiet and the touch is good.  It is a full keyboard-there have not been any complaints about it.  It is easy to type on without fingers slipping off easily.  Although this is used primarily for gaming and video editing, it performs fine for typing too.<br /><br />ALIEN CONTROL CENTER<br />Using the alien control center, you can independently change all of the key values and colors. You can change the backlighting of the back edge of the spine of the laptop.  You can change the color of the alien logo on the cover too which stays lit when in use.<br /><br />You can also set individual profiles for each game in the Alien Control center including changing color of keys of you have an alien mouse, it will integrate into that setting as well so you can change the mouse and macro for each game.  You can also in the profiles add overclocking to specific games.  You can launch the games from the command center, or if you don’t, it will still activate the profile.<br /><br />The only complaint about the control center-needs a simpler layout to change the button configuration on the Alienware mouse.  You are supposed to be able to change the coloring of the Alien power button, but that does not work.<br /><br />OVERCLOCKING AND FAN CONTROLS<br />The overclocking does work, but it has a tendency to run the CPU extremely hot.  Also you can get settings in the command center for fan speed as well as overclocking.  By default, they put you on quiet mode.  The GPU and CPU have a tendency to run very hot and it has to manually be set to a different setting.  We prefer the COOL setting.  Anything less than that, it is not enough to keep components cool during overclocking or ANY operation.<br /><br />ALIEN FUSION<br />You also have quick settings for power & battery to set them.  You can also make adjustments to sound and playback.  There is bass boost, treble enhancer, voice clarity, smart loudness, and also reverb.  This is particularly handy for games.  You can also turn on or off Alienware virtual surround sound.<br /><br />ALIEN VIRTUAL SURROUND SOUND<br />The virtual surround sound works very well.  Without headphones in, using just the speakers, it is easy to forget that you do not have the headphones on.  It is very realistic sounding.<br /><br />It also has audio profiles to choose from modes like movie, game, music etc.<br /><br />GPUs AND CPU AND PERFORMANCE<br />The GPU is a Nvidia GeForce RTX 2070 Max-Q Design.  The 2nd one is the Intel UHD Graphics 630.  The CPU is an Intel Core i7-9750H@2.60GHz with turbo of 4.6.  The GPU has DDR-6GB.  Every game we have thrown at it runs smooth without any hitches at all having to do with the GPU, even tested with overclocking and it still worked great.<br /><br />The CPU handles everything thrown at it, but the number 1 complaint is that while the GPU stays reasonably cool around 70C-80C, the CPU runs very HOT.  It is between 90-100C.  This is due to the fact that the 9th gen intel chip has a much wider turbo spread than previous generations. This causes it to heat up more than any other chip I have used to date for the i7.<br /><br />With using a cooling board under the laptop it does help reduce the heat from 3-6degrees C.<br /><br />CHARGING, BATTERY AND WARNING<br />This comes with a 180W charging brick.  It charges fine, and in normal desktop operation, it runs off of the charger fine.  As soon as you enter into anything graphics intensive, it starts not only drawing from the brick, but it also takes power from the battery.  It does not matter how old of a game it is, it still draws from the battery, while plugged in.<br /><br />This computer can not be used on battery alone when playing ANY kind of graphic oriented game.  It MUST be used while being attached to charging cable.  There is an upgrade option for a 240w brick, which we will try in the future to see if this resolves the situation.<br /><br />WARNING<br />I would like to add that this is just under NORMAL operation without ANY devices attached by USB or anything wireless.  Adding devices makes it drain even worse, again this is all while plugged in.<br /><br />BRICK GETS HOT<br />When running a game on this laptop, one thing that is a bit off putting is that the brick will get very HOT.  It would seem that a higher watt brick would be a better choice for this laptop, which is why we are looking into upgrading in the future to see if that will help.<br /><br />SHUT OFFS<br />I have not had it shut off on us while gaming yet, but it does require to be charged once you are done gaming because if you intend to use this while gaming, you will need the battery charged AND keep it plugged in.  You can not let the battery go dead with this and run it off of plug only.<br /><br />PORTS<br />This has a headphone/mic combo jack that works fine.  The ethernet jack unlike the problems that others have complained about being stuck gave us no trouble.  We just are sure to press completely to remove it.  The 3 USB 3.1 jacks has one with a power designation.  There is a lightning port on the spine/back edge of the laptop.  It works well as it is supposed to.<br /><br />There is also an HDMI and mini display port on the back.  They have worked well.<br /><br />GAMES TESTED<br />Two Worlds 2 (CPU heavy game)<br />Kingdom Come Deliverance (GPU heavy game)<br />Arma 3 (Balanced draw on both)<br />Tom Clancy Rainbow Six Seige (CPU and GPU heavy game)<br />Pixel Junk Monsters (Light Game)<br />Age of Empires 3 (Light Game)<br />Various other lighter games..<br /><br />All games work well.  We have heavier hitting games we want to test in the future, such as Metal Gear Solid 5 but we have not had the chance.  We will update if anything changes.<br /><br />TOBII EXPERIENCE<br />This is where the experience gets frustrating.  We started this whole laptop experience with such a horrible frustration that it has left us with a few loose ends that still are not working well.  We have used this with Kingdom Come Deliverance which is TOBII enabled.  You are supposed to be able to use the TOBII with the camera to be able to navigate and click on things, but for some reason it just won’t work.  Due to the horrible beginning with this computer, it seems that this feature still has not worked right since it was wiped clean once already.<br /><br />OUR NIGHTMARE LAPTOP EXPERIENCE<br />Now we are going to enter into a place no one wants to go when they get a new laptop.  The DYSFUNCTIONAL LAPTOP.  Let’s see how DELL handled what we went through.<br /><br />THE FIRST DAY<br />I opened our computer I was all excited to get this up and running.  I have done a lot of computer building over the years and tend to be pretty good at putting systems together and trouble shooting.  I figured it would be an easy experience.  BOY was I WRONG.  When I opened the laptop, I entered all of the information to get it started up and it was fine until it suddenly started to update itself (without my permission) and then it went nuts.<br /><br />PANIC!<br />The computer rebooted itself and then began to re-write the BIOS.  I could not intervene and about an hour later, instead of powering down, the laptop was getting hotter and hotter and the system was dark.  I was unable to get it to turn off.  I unplugged it and tried pressing the power button until my finger was numb.  NOTHING would turn this thing off.<br /><br />We were approaching the hour and a half mark and I called for the technical support line’s help.  This was NUTS.  I waited and waited, and then suddenly while my finger had become one with the button, the tech support rep got on the phone and BAM it worked.<br />IS THAT FIRE I SMELL?<br />I thought all was well.  Then the trouble started.  The charging cable was not lighting up.  There is a light on it. Perhaps it was dead, right?  Nope.  When trying to start the laptop up with another one of us, it suddenly made a weird noise, and smelled like it was BURNING.  It was dead.  I mean DEAD.<br /><br />We called tech support about this and got the nicest person who was very patient, knowledgeable and helpful.  Not only did we get an immediate return label, but a box was shipped out to us FAST for us to retun it to Dell.<br /><br />We had our laptop back within a week and it had been wiped clean.  The motherboard had a short in it and the charging cable was fried.  They had to wipe out the laptop harddrive to get it to start again so as a result some of the programs which worked well at first for the few hours we had the laptop working have been messed up since.<br /><br />DOES IT WORK NOW?<br />This laptop works now very well.  It has been running fine.  The wiping of the hard drive has led us to some software problems that did not get synced right when trying to replace them again and it is frustrating like the TOBII.<br /><br />THE BOTTOM LINE<br />Our beginning experience with this laptop was awful.  The nightmare was made better as Dell treated us with respect, importance and took care of us right away.  They repaired the system and although some software does not work right yet, the hardware is doing all right and that is a relief.  This laptop is a great performer despite some cautions.  It is a great gaming system and high performance for graphics too.<br /><br />MY RATING<br />FIVE STARS although I will say that with caution.  Our initial experience was frustrating and took some serious time to get fixed, but Dell was excellent and treated us very well.  We have a system that works except for the software which we have not been able to straighten out yet.  I hope we can get it fixed soon and running as it should.<br /><br />SUGGESTION<br />DON'T UPDATE THE BIOS UNLESS YOU ARE SURE THERE IS NO PROBLEM WITH IT.  Do your research first if the laptop does not do it for you first, of course!<br /><br />PHOTOS<br />The first three photos are the 3 benchmark stats for the games, the other 3 are in game screen shots with stats."
AG5F4B4NU6DRMAKP743BDE5S3T5Q,B015JKNDJ0,5,33,True,"This is the main board in my new rig, with Intel 6700K and Samsung 950 parts. It all works great, but the technology has changed so much over the last 18 months that I spent quite a while puzzling over everything. Here are some hints:<br /><br />1. Read the very detailed instruction book before you begin. The second part of the instruction book covers the BIOS, which I found mostly self-explanatory. The first part of the instructions were indispensable. The instruction book for your case will probably be helpful too.<br /><br />2. Look over all the parts that come in the box, and understand what they all do before assembling things.<br /><br />3. Be aware that you'll need to install the standoffs in your case, and assemble whatever cooling solution you're using BEFORE mounting the motherboard in the case. I didn't do this, and I had to remove and reinstall (twice, sigh). Silly me.<br /><br />4. There are lots of connector pins on the board for various things. They are labeled, but hard to read without a bright flashlight. The instruction book has a very good picture map of them all.<br /><br />5. The package comes with *everything* that I needed, including the M.2 host adapter board, thermistors to monitor interior case temperatures. This package is loaded!<br /><br />6. The two assist fans are hard to figure out. One goes on the top of the motherboard, in almost the exact center. You remove a metal cover that ends up being a keychain. That's what the little keychain cable was for! Told you it comes with everything. The other assist fan goes in the back, near the rear panel USB connectors. It's not hard at all to install, but neither is it obvious. I puzzled over this for a while before I figured out how to screw the fan to the plastic slider piece. Be sure to observe the airflow direction of the assist fans as you install them.<br /><br />7. It comes with very competent on-board video, but of course you might want your own GTX 980 card instead!<br /><br />8. With Windows installed on the M.2 drive, the thing boots up in like 4 seconds. Web pages appear instantly. This 6th generation technology is a huge step up from what we put up with only a year ago!<br /><br />9. There are lots of options for overclocking, changing voltages, etc. BEWARE: If you don't know what you're doing here, you can do permanent damage. Best to work with someone who has done this before.<br /><br />Hope you have fun building!"

AFLBMDZDIPCHMWWA7CXQXITPBJKA,B07WRSW269,4,1,False,"[[VIDEOID:139d076ab53a69b4c9863743d4ea0df8]] I ordered the ‘MOZA AirCross 2 Stabilizer 3-Axis Handheld Lightweight Powerful Gimbal for Camera Up 7Lb Intuitive Control Panel Intelligent Features Advanced Shooting Modes 12h Battery Life Beyond Your Imagination’ for review and would like to share my thoughts.<br /><br />First off I would like to let it be known that this is my very first camera gimbal. With that said, understand that I am not very savvy when it comes to gimbals. I am fairly new to filmmaking and videography. Now that you know that this will not necessarily be a super technical review, I will share some of what I have experienced thus far with this gimbal.<br /><br />I ordered this originally to use with my Canon 60D DSLR. From the Moza website, I did find the 60D listed as a compatible camera, so I figured that this gimbal would work which it, it but not exactly how I had expected. The 60D is a DSLR camera which is a bit on the heavy side and I did find it a bit tricky at first to get the camera to balance correctly. Once balanced, the gimbal did work, though I could tell it struggled. I have since read and watched many reviews with even lighter cameras, and users have stated the same thing. The Moza AirCross 2 is rated for a max weight of 7lbs and my 60D comes in at 2.7lbs with the EF 17-40mm L lens, so there really shouldn’t be an issue. Yet when checking the gimbal it showed all axis at or near 100% which means that the gimbal is working hard to handle the camera weight even though it’s nowhere near the max weight advertised.<br /><br />Since then, I have upgraded my camera to the Canon 90D (yes another DSLR). It’s slightly lighter but not by too much. I am still using the EF 17-40mm L lens which, in-of-itself is a fairly heavy lens. It’s probably the heaviest yet the best glass that I own. This has made little to no difference in the Moza AirCross2 working hard on all axis however it does seem to handle this set up a bit better. See attached video and note that I had added a small microphone to the camera which turned out not being set up right on the new camera. So the balance was slightly off for the recording yet the gimbal worked. There was some slight shaking in the footage but overall I was happy with the performance. Again, being an ameture at this I am just happy to have a working gimbal haha.<br /><br />Now for some other issues. First I cannot get the 90D mounted and balanced to where the Roll axis bar won’t hit the Pan axis bar when trying to do a full Roll. This is a real bummer. I am not sure if it’s something that I am doing wrong or this is just the way it is with this particular camera. Second issue I have had is that the Moza AirCross2 comes with a plethora of cables to hook up to your various cameras. It was trial and error for me on both cameras to find which one I was “supposed” to use. Eventually it seems that both (60D and the 90D) seem to do better with the Micro USB cable yet again, I am not positive which I am “supposed” to be using. I could not find any documentation that stated what cable should go with what camera. Third, I thought that I would have more control over the camera with this gimbal. I understand not having all the options available for the 60D, but I figured there would be more options that I could control the camera with on the 90D. All I can seem to do via the gimbal on the 90D is control the video record button. For the 60D I was able to get the camera to autofocus and take a picture but that's about it. Even with the very nice App that you can download for the gimbal, there isn’t a whole lot that I can get to work to control either camera. Again I would have thought the 90D would have been more compatible seeing as it has both WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities. I do plan to do more research as there may be settings on the camera that I need to enable.<br /><br />On the plus side of things, this is a nice quality gimbal. It is a bit heavy with my camera mounted but it feels solid. The App is nice although I have not used it to its full potential as of yet. The included foam hard case is very nice and keeps everything safe and tidy. Everything fits snug. Some parts more than others but nothing is going to be flopping around inside. The footage taken with this gimbal is so much smoother than if I were to try and take it all hand-held. Even running looks great (to my untrained eye). Again see attached video.<br /><br />Overall, I am both disappointed and quite happy with this gimbal. Disappointed that it’s not all I had hoped for, yet very happy to actually have a working gimbal. It’s been a huge learning curve for me and I really want to give this gimbal a 5 star rating. However I feel that with the advertised max weight being an issue for me and others much more savvy, that takes one star away. Plus the fact that the Roll axis bar hits the Pan axis bar when the camera and gimbal are balanced is annoying. For that I won’t dock a star, as this may be user error. I would just say that if you own a mirrorless camera then this would be great for you. If you own a heavier DSLR, you may want to look at spending a little more for one better rated for the extra weight."
AFLBMDZDIPCHMWWA7CXQXITPBJKA,B07GM2TCPM,5,10,False,"I ordered the Acer Chromebook 15, Intel Celeron N3350, 15.6"" Full HD Touch, 4GB LPDDR4, 32GB Storage, Google Chrome, Pure Silver, CB515-1HT-C2AE, 15-15.99 inches so that I might have a lightweight portable travel laptop to enjoy and use for travel and at home. I have had some time with the new Chromebook and I would like to share a few thoughts and experiences with this particular model.<br /><br />The first thing that I noticed with this Acer Chromebook was how thin and lightweight it was. It reminded me of a Macbook, though I have never owned one. I love the silver metal look and the keyboard is very enjoyable and comfortable to use. The speakers on either side of the keyboard are nice and sound amazing considering the size and the fact that they are housed in a very thin and compact space.<br /><br />Initially I did experience some issues with the screen where it would not turn on despite the fact that there was power. It was very random but about 80% of the time the display would not turn on. I was able to contact Acer and they did resolve the issue within a reasonable amount of time. I had to send it back to Acer and they replaced the mainboard which I assume was the culprit. As I type up this review I am doing so on the repaired Chromebook and I have to say that though I had that initial experience, Acer made it right and I absolutely love this product! I’m not real savvy with the Chromebook OS but it really is simple and I appreciate the fact that this model comes with a Micro SD slot for my 128gb card which will come in handy to use for loading some movies and or music for on-the-go. Also it will come in handy for loading a few photos to edit with my favorite mobile photo editing app using the excellent touch screen which I quite enjoy.<br /><br />Speaking of movies I have played a bit with Netflix, Google Movies and Hulu and the video quality is quite amazing with the 1080p screen resolution and, as I mentioned earlier, the sound is surprisingly loud and clear.<br /><br />Battery life has been pretty impressive and lasts much better than I expected. As I stated before, this has been my first Chromebook experience so the only thing I have to compare battery life with is my much larger gaming laptop which I can't even get a few hours of use before I need to plug in.<br /><br />Overall this Acer Chromebook 15 has been quite enjoyable, and because of Acer’s great support, I would highly recommend this Chromebook if you are looking for an inexpensive well rounded mobile “Laptop” experience."
AGA7PGARZTF6CBCPJL7PD3WPH7OA,B07J4VJX6L,5,28,True,"(11/20/2018) I purchased the MSI RTX 2070 Gaming Z 8G.  I took many factors and pricing based on what was available and compared to other cards.  I was primarily looking for a card to replace my ASUS GTX 970 Turbo.  With Battlefield 5 releasing and testing my setup (below) with the GTX 970, my settings could only handle 60 FPS with everything at medium.  Battlefield 1, I was able to play at around 80 FPS with DX12 off, so it was definitely time to upgrade.<br /><br />My Setup:<br />CPU: Intel Core i7 7700k at 4.2 GHz<br />RAM: 16 GB Vengance<br />Motherboard: ASUS Strix B250G Gaming<br />Monitor: ASUS MG278Q (2K res at 144 Hz)<br /><br />Upon receiving the card, the card is definitely bigger than the GTX 970 and heavier.  Make sure you have enough room in your case as this card extends the micro ATX board setup.  The card come with plates and can customize the RGB LED's.<br /><br />I chose this card as it was par with the RTX 2080 in cores and clock speeds, and even the GTX 1080.  The downfall which many will know is that RAY tracing is not amazing with this card.  I play all my games in 2k res at 144Hz and really only enjoy playing FPS at or above 60 FPS.  Playing BF5 with ray tracing on (low) with everything at ultra had around 20 to 30 FPS average with sometimes reaching mid 50's.  Once i reduced my graphics to high instead of ultra, FPS gains were up 10 to 20 FPS.  With Ray tracing off and everything on ultra, I was getting anywhere between 80 to 130 FPS.  Changing my res to 1080 with everything on ultra and even RAY tracing on ultra I had FPS above 60.  The downfall to this was quality of the game graphics.<br /><br />As of 12/13/2018, EA/Nvidia release patches that improved the FPS with RAY tracing, but only a gain of about 10 FPS.  I still continue to play BF5 with RAY tracing off and everything on ultra.  I did notice some hiccups where the game would freeze for a split of a millisecond, but it could be the game more than the card as BF5 is still buggy.<br /><br />As of 4/4/2019 this card continues to perform perfectly with any game I throw at it.  I currently have been playing anthem with above 50 FPS with the new ray tracing features and DLSS available in the game.  There are some dips due to high fidelity and other high graphical areas within a battle area, which is why the lowest I have seen is 50 FPS.  With Ray tracing turned off, i get above 70 FPS.  While this card is big, I am hoping to replace the stock fan with a water loop system.  On a micro ATX board, do not expect to utilize any of the PCI lanes besides the one for the GPU.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this upgrade for the price.  The 1080 ti stock is basically depleted or costs over $1000.  The 2080 cards are better than the stock 2070 cards, but this msi card is par or better than the 2080 stock cards.  Only advantage to the 2080 cards was more CUDA cores.  This is my first msi card as well, since i usually go with EVGA or ASUS.  EVGA unfortunately did not have any in stock during the time of my purchase."
AGA7PGARZTF6CBCPJL7PD3WPH7OA,B00A0HZMGA,5,0,True,"First off, i had a little bit of a problem installing the backplate for this setup.  You do not have to remove the backplate at all when you put the corsair black backplate on.  My setup is consisted of a push pull system for my radiator.  I have it mounted on the top of my chassis hooked up to an LGA 1155 motherboard with a 2500 cpu intel core i7.  I have it setup at 3.5 Ghz so far, and i plan to push it to 4.0 ghz.  I have ran Real Temp GT version 3.7 for an hour and thirty minutes.  My results so far as of idle and playing some battlefield 3 on ultra consist of the following<br /><br />core 1-25C min,  53C max<br />core 2-24C min,  53C max<br />core 3-25C min,  51C max<br />core 4-25C min,  53C max<br /><br />My idle temps consist of around 30C.<br /><br />Based on air to the H60, you will only see 10 degrees C difference.  Of course this is also based on the pre applied thermal paste that comes on the GPU cooler.  I have not tried an aftermarket thermal paste, which would result in different temps.  I have an adequate chassis supported with 2 fans in the front to intake air, 1 fan on top to intake air along with the radiator setup, and 1 fan for exhaust in the back to keep the flow of the air within the chassis continuous. I currently also have the GTX 670 gpu in my computer which will soon be applied with the H60 cooler as well with my modified setup.  This could potentially see a difference in temps, but nothing too major.<br /><br />Overall, this is a decent way to quiet the computer and keep your cpu cool.  It did take some time to setup based on how you want the GPU cooler to be setup.  I would recommend this to a friend if they want all of the above.

AEDOHFM25ZBJNS3VNSOZ62IM2IQA,B09G1QJTL7,5,4,False,"I'm coming to this machine as a Mac user who needed a light-but-powerful Windows machine for some specific business purposes.<br /><br />Bottom line: I'm impressed.<br /><br />First, the basics.  This is a thin/lightweight model with a 4-core i7 CPU, a 14 inch screen, and Intel's latest integrated graphics.  Its body is a black magnesium affair, good-looking and really lightweight.  The black finish is satiny and looks a bit like plastic but is far more rigid.<br /><br />This laptop is based on Intel’s new “Eco” i7 chipset that runs cooler and more efficiently than Intel’s recent offerings.  I’ve hammered it pretty hard and it’s been stable, cool and quiet.  My model's specs are quite good for a lightweight business laptop, with a proper 1TB NVMe SSD and 32GB RAM.<br /><br />For comparison purposes, in terms of price and features it’s roughly comparable to a current-model M1-based MacBook Air.  Now, an Air with 16GB RAM (which, given its ARM architecture, is functionally equivalent to about 32GB on a Wintel machine) and 1TB SSD lists for $1509 direct from Apple.  The LG was about $1750 at the time of my purchase.  It has no biometric login gizmo, which is okay because for some reason the Windows world has yet to implement one that works half as well as Apple’s TouchID.  It has the expected webcam, microphone and speakers… all of decent quality and again comparable to the Air’s.  It has two USB-C/Thunderbolt 4 ports and two USB-A 3.2 ports.  There’s an SD card reader and of course some spiffy WiFi and Bluetooth.  It has a 14” screen, slightly larger than the Air’s.  Resolution is similar, and I have no complaints about color fidelity or brightness with either machine.<br /><br />The differences are most obvious in the details.<br /><br />Keyboard<br />Both machines have truly excellent keyboards.  Both can keep up with my frenetic speed-typist pounding and have a good feel and throw.  But the LG’s keyboard backlighting surrounds each key with an unwanted glow that looks a bit cheap.  So, the keyboard scores maybe an 8 on the Apple scale of 1-10.<br /><br />Trackpad<br />Similarly, the trackpad is the best I’ve used on a Windows machine but is still behind Apple’s in terms of the hardware’s fluidity and consistent behavior.  Fortunately, on the software side, Windows has advanced mightily in terms of gestures and support of things like multiple virtual desktops, so this machine can replicate most of my Mac-centric workflow without too much getting-used-to, if you spend some time fiddling in the setup screens.  Score: another 8.<br /><br />Display<br />The screen is fine, glossy like the Air's but not as glasslike and flat.  Intel's latest integrated GPU is more than adequate for my purposes, and I've noticed no stuttering or frame limitations.  Another 8.<br /><br />Construction<br />The magnesium chassis is stiff and solid while remaining commendably lightweight and thin.  The bezels are very thin as well; the top bezel contains the tiny camera and two nearly invisible microphone apertures.  It merits a 9 on the Air's jewel-like reference 10.<br /><br />Power<br />Battery life is good, not up to MacBook M1 standards, but looks like I'll top 6 hours of pretty intensive multitasking use with the screen on full brightness.  Charging is via USB-C.  The LG charger is compact and comes with long AC and DC cables.  Call this another 8, with the Air demerited to an 9 as battery-life leader Apple no longer provides a long AC cord.<br /><br />Summary<br />So far so good.  After two Dells that were unsatisfactory and poorly supported, two HPs that died young, and after watching Lenovo go downhill, this seemed a good choice.<br /><br />I'd certainly recommend it if a Mac is not an option for your use.  The Air remains my top choice and is a better value, and the Genius Bars are wonderful for support and getting questions answered.<br /><br />So far there's been only one surprise: despite LG being a Korean company, this laptop is made in China... like the Air."

AFBTEUJ64WBMX6OGWXMX3LYMTXOA,B00E3W1726,4,0,True,"The drive delivers on the SSD promise: very fast access times, even on an older computer supporting SATA1 only.  The computer boots up so fast it reminds me of old days before operating systems became so bloated.  (Yes, I'm talking pre-history.)<br /><br />However, as others have noted, the software supplied with it for migration is just terrible, it only works if everything is perfect.  And the instructions and error messages are completely inadequate (mostly missing, really).<br /><br />I wanted to do more than complain, however.  I figured I'd share some experience and some tips, that might help another user.<br /><br />My existing disk was a 1TB hard drive that had some bad sectors (hence my desire to replace).  I removed enough data from it to reduce the usage down to about 160GB, figuring that was good for a 250MB destination disk.  Then I tried the Samsung cloning software.  Many times.  It kept failing, sometimes early, often after a few hours.  With no useful information (unless you count obscure error codes that are not documented to be information).  I tried running disk defrag, achieved no useful result, other than a failure after the cloning reported 100% complete.  Deeply frustrating.<br /><br />I couldn't do a system image restore, because Windows (Microsoft is another producer of dumb and unfriendly software) will only do a restore to a disk of the same configuration.  (Here the message is simply that it &#34;can't find a suitable disk&#34;, you have to hunt to figure out why.)  And I wasn't about to buy a 1TB flash drive.<br /><br />And I wanted to give it one good try before settling for reinstalling from scratch, because I didn't want to spend several more days getting my computer back to where it was.<br /><br />Solution:  I highly recommend using defraggler (from Piriform) to clean up your disk.  You might also find it useful to shrink your partition to the minimum possible, using the WIndows disk management tool.  Then I highly recommend using the Macrium Reflect Free Edition to do an &#34;intelligent&#34; clone of your OS volume to the SSD.<br /><br />After I did this, everything worked perfectly, no problems.  Wish I'd known about these tools and all the gotchas ahead of time.<br /><br />Another tip:  If you want to set AHCI in the BIOS (yes, now I'm getting to advanced users), you may need to first enable the AHCI drivers, otherwise Windows will not boot up (you'll get a BSOD).  Do a search for this, there's a Microsoft KB article.<br /><br />Good luck!"

No longer can it accept Ethernet connections, so my Air Port is acting as the single port for me when I need two.  Bummed.<br /><br />This was modem number three to replace the rental with my Time Warner service.  Finally.  Following the ratings from intelligent and thoughtful people (who provided details of WHY other models weren't any good), I resigned myself to paying more to get something reliable.<br />I also subscribed to the &#34;white models are genuine Arris, black models are junk&#34;.  Arris bought Motorola, so I think Arris is superior.<br /><br />This was the right one for me, if two days of heavy use counts for anything.  I wanted built-in WiFi as a backup to my Apple AirPort, and wanted more than one internet connection.  I wanted downward compatibility so I could connect my old Big Mac G4 through the internet port, and have it do basic internet functions.  This modem is both IPv4 and IPv6 compatible through Time Warner.  (Your ISP must have the capability to address the modem with the right code, which varies from maker to maker and sometimes between models.)<br /><br />No hangs and 404 errors I was getting with TWC's own modem, and the installation with the TWC field tech was a quick matter (15 minutes), including connecting/testing hard wire Internet, renaming, changing passwords, and masking the Broadcast ID - which I recommend you do after you connect all your devices (so they have the correct Network ID stored, but others in the area don't see the modem to try to hack into it).  Do yourself a favor if you call a tech:  power up the modem upon receipt to make sure it works.

AGW2YFQE4AOEHCE747ESDJYULJMA,B00NR2VMNC,1,0,True,"I wanted this range extender so that I could stop using 2.4ghz because it has become too crowded in my neighborhood. The range extender only broadcasts 5G in the following conditions--straight out of the box when it isn't connected to the router, when you set up the extender to NOT connect to the 5G router signal, or when you select High Speed Option 1, which connects to the router by 2.4Ghz but broadcasts on 5G. So it's absolutely impossible to get it to connect to the router via 5G and broadcast 5G. I spent HOURS trying to set it up every which way. I repeatedly tried to set it up via WPS, via the internet, and after doing several factory restores. Every single time, the same poor effects. Having exhausted all possible ways of setting it up, I made the mistake of calling customer support. It was easily the worst customer service call I have ever experienced. I have lived and studied outside of the States and work with many, many colleagues who are from many different countries, and I rarely have trouble understanding someone who speaks competent English with an accent. However, the woman I spoke with was frequently unintelligible. I often had to ask her to repeat herself and could not answer her questions on the first try because it sounded like she was speaking gibberish. It was probably just the language difference, but she also had trouble understanding or remembering my responses, so I had to answer the same questions several times. Nonetheless, I reset the range extender with her over the phone several times. After forty-five minutes she told me that she'd have to have an engineer call me back tomorrow, at which point I said I'd just send it back and they can fix it on their own time. At one point she offered to email me updated firmware (the TP Link website only has firmware older than what came on range extender), but then at the end of the call when I reminded her of this, she said the firmware was universal and isn't even designed for this device. I asked her to send it to me. She asked me if I wanted her to send it to me. I said yes. She asked me again if I wanted her to send it to me. I again said yes. She asked AGAIN if I wanted her to send it to me, and I had enough and hung up. I hope this device is just defective as I've requested a replacement. If the second one works, I'll update my review accordingly. If not, I will promptly return it and be done with this fiasco."

AG72HX472DIWRIKRGDJ3CK5LSEGQ,B004M8RPBI,4,10,True,"(Review updated 90 days after purchase, my opinions have improved somewhat, and i will correct a couple errors in my review, and add more content to my review refining my critiques and adding some new observations -jeff)<br /><br />I really wanted to love this receiver, but the quality control and attention to product usability detail are not what I have come to expect (I'm spoiled by Apple attention to usability, no doubt)..<br /><br />Let's start with the iControlAV2 iPad app, since that is a major reason why people want this receiver.  The functions to setup the audio (eq etc) are nice, but you basically use them once.  After that, your main use of the app will be changing volume and input, for zone 1 and zone 2 (if you enable zone two like I have).<br /><br />Here are the major problems with this app control:<br /><br />  1  The receiver's wired ethernet port will power off with the receiver, and when it powers back on, it doesn't request to renew the same IP address it had before (even if 'before' was 5 seconds ago).  This typically results in the receiver getting a different IP address, and the iControl app then giving you an error when you try to control your receiver on next launch.  You have to then go back into the iControl settings and 'select your product'.  Very annoying, and completely breaks the 'wife+kids friendly' possibilities of using app, completely.  UPDATE:  You can configure the receiver to make the receiver stay in 'standby' mode so you can turn it back on from the remote.  I'll admit I simply missed this option in my earlier setup.<br /><br />  2  The iControl App lets you turn off both zones of the receiver, but if you do, you end up powering off the receiver and guess what?  You can't turn it on again unless you physically push the power button on the front of the receiver.. which then gives you problem #1 again.  UPDATE:  This is rectified by enabling Standby mode in the network settings.<br /><br />  3  While 99% of customers are likely going to use this as an AirPlay device, confusingly AirPlay isn't mentioned anywhere in the user interface or on the Ipad application.  You have to select 'H.M.G.' (Home Media Gateway), which then enables airplay. Works fine, but the other 90% of the HMG functionality is useless to me, and simply confuses the user interface.  You can control song play / pause / next / last from the iControl App (effectively remote controlling iTunes), but this control is nowhere near the control you get with Apple's Remote app, which you will almost certainly want to use instead of the iControl app.<br /><br />  4  No iPhone / iPod touch version of the app.  Pretty dumb, again considering the main use case of the app after the novelty of everything other than input control and volume wear off.  UPDATE:  There is now!<br /><br />Problems with the receiver UI:<br />  1) The receiver itself has a decent UI, but to configure many things you will need to have a TV display connected.  The menus for this on-screen display look like bad shareware from 1992, but are functional enough.  It seems crazy to me however, that a product with built in ethernet / IP networking wouldn't have a simple built in web server to allow configuration of inputs etc (everything the O.S.D. does) from your computer, or better yet your iPad.  Navigating the On Screen Display to configure inputs and such is tedious and slow; this should have been completely configurable from my computer / iPad.<br /><br />  2) Zone 2 and 7.1 surround are mutually exclusive.  While I knew this when I bought it, there is no reason why Pioneer couldn't have made a simple toggle to turn on zone two and automatically disable two of the surround speakers (which almost certainly wouldn't be used during zone 2 'music' listening anyway'.  Perhaps nit-picking here, but an intelligent usability feature went completely overlooked here by a product team that clearly sought no customer input on this capability.  UPDATE:  OK, I figured out why there is no toggle!  You have to wire the speakers completely differently if you want to enable zone two.  So if you wire up 7.1 speakers, and want to have another pair of speakers off in another location (I have a pair over my desk), then your only option is to wire the remote speaker pair to what ends up being the 'Speaker B' outputs.  These speakers get the same output as the main front R+L speakers, and you can toggle between A+B, A, B, or Both Off (which is pointless, in my opinion).  Annoyingly, you cannot toggle the Speaker A/B/A+B/Off setting from the iControl AV2 iPhone/iPad application, which is a shame since this is simply a soft button control on the front of the receiver.  This effectively makes the Speaker B -> Remote speakers option useless for me, since I would have to physically walk to where the receiver is from my office (different room).  It still seems like Pioneer could have engineered this thing to allow 'soft switching' between 7.1 and 5.1 + Zone 2 settings from the iControlAV2 remote application, this would have provided maximum flexibility.  As it is, if you plan on connecting 7.1 speaker setup, the Zone 2 features are completely unusable to you.<br /><br />Miscellaneous minor complains:<br />  1  No S-Video inputs or coax digital inputs.<br />  2  No native zone-2  via my Harmony 890 (presumably not Pioneer's fault, but if I were the PM for this product I would make an effort to get prolific up to date support for all features in popular 3rd party products).<br />  3) Only 1 subwoofer out (would be nice for a 2nd output for zone 2).<br />  4) No AirPlay Video support.  This means I have to add an AppleTV2 to one of the HDMI inputs on the Pioneer.. which means that the built-in AirPlay audio support in the Pioneer now serves no (unique) purpose and would be redundant.<br /><br />Lastly, I had to return (to Amazon) the first VSX-1021 I was sent; after operating for a few hours, the HMG / network control functions would stop working, and would require a power cycle to rectify.  A (lengthy) call to Pioneer tech support led to further frustration, as they wouldn't simply cross ship me a replacement, despite the unit being less than a month old.  Their answer is to 'bring it to a Pioneer service center'.  Oh yeah?  And that service center is going to have a wireless network, ethernet switch, Apple iPad etc etc to duplicate my problem?  Seemed fantastically unlikely.  Fortunately Amazon picked up Pioneer's poor technical support slack and sent me an New In Box advanced replacement (I had already discarded my shipping box.. thanks Amazon!)<br /><br />To be fair, i'm only picking on the things I don't like.  The sound quality is quite good, and certainly that's incredibly important.  All in all though, my main reason for buying this was multi-zone and AirPlay support.  In hind-sight, I might just have bought something else and added a $100 AppleTV2 via Toslink digital out and saved myself the trouble (and had AirPlay video support).<br /><br />3 Stars for now (UPDATE:  making it 4) many of my complains could be addressed by a firmware update of the unit and updated iPad (and hopefully iPhone / iPod Touch apps).<br /><br />After 3 months of use, I do like the Pioneer unit.  However since I did expect to be able to use the Zone 2 features, i'm now in a quandary.. do I buy another VSX-1021 (or VSX-1121) to power the speakers above and behind my desk?  I want Airplay for those too)."

I did not buy them for the tv reason other people do. I just wanted a colorful backdrop for my FaceTime calls.

They should be white to blend in with a wall. So I'll be buying a skinny extension cord to make up for that. Maybe they can change that for future customers.<br /><br />The fact that the lights must both be plugged in to the same source is a definite buzzkill.

The port placement is perfect for my needs and preferences.  It has every port you could really need for the next 6 months to a year, at least considering how fast tech changes.  I love the Display port on it as it's the first USB hub I have owned with a DP on it.  I go through a lot of USB hubs but this one I am going to try to hang onto.  The only thing I don't understand is why they bothered to put USB 2.0 ports on there when they are all backwards compatible, at least as far as I know.  I'm guessing it has something to do with interference but I am not sure on that.<br /><br />I think the size is perfect because of all the features,  but it is a little larger the  some but still extremely portable.  The USB ports on this do not charge devices very well but that is normal and to be expected.  I really don't use the HUB for video very often so I really didn't use graphics ports more then to test out the display port to add a fourth monitor to my system.  It had no problems working with my Alienware M17xR4 with AGA,  The AGA has an ASUS Rog Strix 1080 Ti in it with 2 27"" Monitors and a 55"" TV attached to it.  I was able to add a fourth monitor using the DP on the USB hub, but the 4th monitor also worked through the video card as well.  It took a little load off the graphics card but seemed to slow down the system a bit.  It's kind of like using the internal monitor on the laptop when docked.  I am guessing it was attempting to use the internal GTX 1080 or Intel graphics adapter but didn't confirm my theory on that.  The fact that it worked at all actually kind of surprised me.  My laptop usually stays docked and attached to the Alienware Graphics Amplifier.  When I do take it with me this hub is a true life saver.<br /><br />Data transfer rates were higher then expected even when using multiple ports at once.  This is also the first USB C hub that I have found that allowed a second USB C hub to be installed on a different USB C port.  Not sure if it's designed that way or just luck though.  Usually both are not detected only one, but for some reason I am able to connect both and that's how it should be considering that was the goal of USB in the first place.<br /><br />Overall this is one of the best hubs I have owned to date.  It adds a lot of functionality for a good price.  The Micro-SD and SD card readers are easy to access and use.  It's very user friendly and required no real setup even in my advanced environment.

It has the latest 10th gen Intel processor which offers a lot of performance with minimal power consumption, so this thing operates cool and quietly under normal usage, and even when you stress it by playing games or something the fan noise is pretty mild.<br /><br />The only downside of this particular build is the lack of SSD.  Boot up time and performance under many workloads can be greatly improved by swapping the magnetic hard disk out for a solid state drive.  Another benefit of the old-school case design is that it is very easy to take this laptop apart and upgrade the drive yourself (many newer laptops with sleek case designs are very difficult to upgrade).<br /><br />Overall I think this is a great laptop for the price, perfect for watching DVDs or streaming video with the large screen and plenty of power for most  web/office/productivity tasks.  The only thing its not ideal for is gaming since it only has the onborad intel GPU which isn't sufficient for most modern games."

It is easy to use and the menus are clear and easy to follow without needing to refer to the manual.<br /><br />The video quality is good and it did perform well for me indoors.  I was skeptical as some of the reviews questioned the use in low-light situations.  However, a room with a light turned on proved to be more than sufficient to capture vibrant, crystal clear video.<br /><br />I really appreciate being able to disable the auto power-off feature for longer recordings and the fact that you can plug it in and power it indefinitely.  The dual slots are also a nice touch as the camera will fill card A and seamlessly start recording on card B without user intervention.<br /><br />The battery life is weak.  If you're going mobile and want to record lengthy events, you will definitely need an addtional high-capacity battery.  The included battery lasts barely more than an hour.<br /><br />Overall, I would defintely recommend.  Aside from the battery life I have no complaints and it's a pleasure to use this camera."
AHDZKPPKUT7HD47LXCBN7RQNN6KQ,B09QKPJFTQ,4,2,False,"I've been using desktop PCs since the 1980s. In the old days we always bought the biggest PC cases so we could add more components like multiple disc drives, CD drives, extra I/O and networking ports, a bigger power supply, etc. These days, computers come packed with features and interfaces, internal storage is smaller and cheaper, USB3 is fast enough for external peripherals if we need them, and more and more computing is done in the cloud instead of on the desktop.<br /><br />This little 5 inch x 5 inch x 2 inch box is all I really need for my desktop computing needs. The Intel i5 CPU is the same as what most mid-range laptops use. The built-in SSD and 16gb of RAM are faster than the hard drive and 8gb in our old PC that we replaced with this one. There is space to add a 2.5"" SSD to increase the local storage space (I'm planning to add a 2TB SSD). The computer has plenty of ports; even a microSD flash card slot. The PC comes with Windows 11 pre-installed and it launched flawlessly when I turned the PC on.<br /><br />There are 2 limitations for me. First is that there is only one memory card slot which currently contains a 16GB memory card. This is enough for most people (especially considering the mid-range i5 CPU) but if you want to add more memory, you must discard the 16GB card and replace it with a bigger card. Most PCs have 2 memory card slots so you can simply add a second memory card that adds to the first one. The second limitation is that the built-in graphics processor is not suitable for high-end gaming and there is no room to add a high-performance graphics card. If you are a hard core gamer, you should probably look elsewhere.<br /><br />Considering the size and price of this mini-PC, I think it is fine as an everyday desktop computer for home or for the office. Students will probably want a laptop that they can carry to school, but a lot of adults prefer having a full-sized keyboard and screen and this mini-PC is cheaper than a comparable laptop if you have to buy a separate monitor in either case. If I want more power than my phone when I'm traveling, I bring a tablet instead of a more bulky and more fragile laptop.<br /><br />My only real complaint about this mini-PC is that the fan is not super quiet and it runs a lot when I am multi-tasking with more than one program running."
AHDZKPPKUT7HD47LXCBN7RQNN6KQ,B07GM2J11Q,4,473,False,"Chromebook prices range from around $100 to over $1000. Better Chromebooks have Intel Core CPUs for great performance. The much cheaper Mediatek system in this Chromebook gives it mediocre performance, especially for intensive games or for business users who open lots of tabs simultaneously and frequently switch between them. On the plus side this Chromebook has a useful 4GB of RAM, a sharp colorful IPS screen, a touch screen that works great with Android apps, a very responsive (for swiping) touchpad, and reliable WiFi (much better than my HP laptop). On the minus side, the white plastic shell looks and feels a little cheap, the screen is not very bright, and the touchpad's button feels a little clunky. In summary, if you can't afford more than $300, this is a good choice for casual users who only have a few tabs open at once and use it mostly for email, Facebook, web surfing, and streaming music or videos. If you can afford $350 to $400, you will have several choices with more powerful CPUs for more intensive users."
AHDZKPPKUT7HD47LXCBN7RQNN6KQ,B01LXYG77O,5,5,False,"Really like this Chromebook so far. This is our 3rd Chromebook. My first Chromebook (now used by the kids) was an 11&#34; Acer C720 from a couple of years ago. My second Chromebook was an 10&#34; Asus Chromebook Flip from last year, which is very similar to this Acer R13, except that the screen on the Acer is much bigger. I still use the 10&#34; Asus for air travel when something small and light is great for the suitcase, but the 10&#34; size is really too cramped for everyday use.<br /><br />The Acer R13 is better in almost every way than the Acer C720. The screen is sharper and more colorful. The keyboard and touchpad are much more responsive. The CPU is much faster, though not in the same league as the Intel Core CPUs that you find on the top-of-the-line Chromebooks. The metal case on the R13 is very professional looking compared to the plastic case on the C720. Battery life with the C720 was good, but great with the R13. Despite the bigger size and metal case, the R13 is only half a pound heavier than the C720. The R13 uses a standard USB-C charging cable, unlike the proprietary cable on the C720 that I am always worried about losing, but you do only get one USB-C port that is used for both charging and data transfer (2 ports would be nicer). The only thing I like better about the C720 is the full-sized SD card slot. For some reason, the R13 only has a micro-SD card slot, so you can't quickly pull the SD card out of your camera and view the photos on your laptop screen. Also, most people have a pile of old SD cards that they could use reuse, but micro-SD is less common. Why Acer???<br /><br />The R13 has a touchscreen, which my Asus Flip also has. The Acer C720 does not have a touchscreen. For Chrome apps, the touchscreen isn't that useful. However, Android apps are available for the R13 (if you switch the Chrome beta channel) and also the Asus Flip. Android brings a whole new level of functionality to Chromebooks. A larger screen improves the user experience of many Android apps and just having these apps available makes your Chromebook much more useful since most Android apps have better user interfaces or better functionality than Chrome web apps. Android apps are especially interesting when you are using your Chromebook without a WiFi connection since Android apps are much more likely (than Chrome apps) to be functional without an internet connection. Many if not most Android apps are much easier to use with a touchscreen vs the touch pad. If you're going to use Android apps, definately buy a Chromebook with a touchscreen. The glossy touchscreen on the R13 does collect fingerprints pretty quickly, though.<br /><br />Yes, $400 is a lot for a Chromebook, but Chromebooks are a lot more functional these days, especially now that they run Android apps. You can get a slow cheap Windows laptop for the same price, but a Chromebook starts up so much faster that you'll really only want to use Windows if you need to use particular apps that are not available for Chrome or Android."

AE5VPKX64CVOPH6X75C7EQXAIGLA,B00GODG3X0,3,3,True,"I ordered this NITECORE i4 Intellicharge universal smart battery Charger to enhance my charging needs, specifically my NCR 18650 batteries.  I also have a Lacrosse BC-700 I use primarily for AA and AAA batteries and I think it has been the best charger I have owned for this use.  I also own a MP-906 for charging my seldom used C, D and 9 volt batteries and I also like it and it does a good job charging these specific batteries for me.  I recently realized the more frequent purchase of the 3.7v Li-ion batteries were being charged with a cheap charger I got with a couple of purchases I made for Led Flashlights and a storage device.  I wanted a smart charger for them and the safe charging that is capable with a microprocessor controlled device for this purpose.  I have already tried it with my rechargeables, AA, C and my Li-ion batteries.  The design of the positive terminal contact for batteries charging is a bump of chromed metal which caused the battery to slide off to the side, an irritant to me and the Li-ion batteries with the flat positive end needs some manipulation and for me, a magnet, to get them to seat for charging.  If this won't bother you, OK.  What I have noticed first was the AA rechargeable Alkaline batteries were charged up to a slightly higher value, 1.5+ as to the 1.35 or so I got with the Lacrosse, Similar results came with the C cells and now the Li-ion batteries. My use of rechargeable alkaline batteries in this charger makes them get hot if they stay in the charger past topping out, so I only charge them while I am right there and I do not leave them in the charger unattended - ever.  If you do this you will most likely have problems.  I should just use the charger that came with them, that I didn't mention before, as they are a special trial battery for me.  They are Igo.  I'm happy at this time and if it holds up and continues to impress me, like my Lacrosse has for many years, I may up the stars given in this review.  Time will tell.  After using this charger now along side other smart chargers I have purchased since purchasing this unit I generally feel this $20 unit is not my best charger, the LittoKala 260 is my most trusted smart charger for several reasons, the least of which is it's ability to discharge and recharge a cylindrical battery of lithium ion type design. This battery charger is now used sparingly and will go the way of chargers that don't do what you want them to and really just disappoints."

AHVAREFM6VL26ZT3NNF5CU7XHKAA,B003MPOLX2,5,14,False,"Let me start by saying I've owned dozens of cameras, about two years ago I stepped up to a Canon DSLR and enjoyed it tremendously.  After two years with the DSLR I started looking to replace it with something a little smaller (the size and weight of the SLR making it prohibitive for all my travels/uses).  So I sold off the Canon and ended up buying and returning three different point and shoots before finally stumbling onto the NEX-3!<br /><br />The picture quality easily rivals that of my Canon XSi, yet the size and weight are deceptively small.  As much as I practiced and tried different lenses and techniques, I was never able to get great low-light shots from my XSi, with the 16mm prime lens, the Sony constantly gives me great low light performance - without using the flash.  Speaking of the flash, I was skeptical at first about the whole detachable flash - for fear of losing it or breaking it.  Once I installed it I found that it's really not that obtrusive, when closed (in the down position) it hardly adds any mass to the camera and unless it's in the open position, the camera doesn't even recognize it's presence.<br /><br />Some have complained about the user interface, while I've grown accustomed/spoiled by manual controls the NEX-3 menu system is really easy to navigate.  Even my parents were able to change settings and get some amazing shots without being told how, or looking at a manual.  Some of the ""helpful"" tips are a bit basic, but those can be turned off quite easily.<br /><br />The ""handheld twilight"" mode is amazing, taking several pictures at different exposures then combining them into one - why haven't all camera manufactures jumped on this bandwagon?  Sure you get some color distortion, but the ability to take a picture in all but the darkest settings and still be able to see what was there is mind blowing. How many people with a point and shoot can walk outside at midnight and take a good picture of the moon?  What's that you say?  You don't want to mess with a bunch of settings?  Just set it to intelligent auto mode and let it choose for you!<br /><br />Pleasantly surprised, by far the best camera I've ever owned!  Cannot recommend highly enough!"
AEHVMGM7F5XV7ZIVECBB345NOO4A,B0964DPVH8,5,13,True,"I'm a die hard 3D fanatic. I've been through it all ( started with 13 Ghosts in a movie theater as a child). Through the years, I've experimented with 3D tech as it progressed. From flickering active glasses to the passive,  movie theater style approach . I still have a 3D computer monitor and TV, though they're not set up at the moment. I even have 2 Nintendo 3DS units which was quite an accomplishment being the first,  truly mainstream product that did not require glasses to view 3D, and finally, the ultimate 3D experience was/is VR using the Oculus Rift/Quest systems. Yes, it is quite the tech, but wearing the headset is not something you'd want to do for long periods, as it can become uncomfortable , and I don't always like the feeling of cutting off my real world surroundings.<br /><br /> Fast forward to 2021. I had my eye on the Lume tablet, but not at the original price. I already had an iPad Pro which is pretty unbeatable. When I saw the $299.00 price tag (April 2022),  it was a no brainer. I always wanted an android tablet as an alternative anyway. The flexibility of the Android OS goes beyond IOS, making it a helluva lot more interesting for tinkerers and people who love to customize!<br /><br />Well, I'm happy to say,  this tablet is beyond my expectations.. Look, if you didn't grow up with 3D tech, and expect Jason Vorhees to jump out of the screen and slice you,  then you're not meant for this. Go play in VR insead. When you understand going in,  the limitations of 3D, then you'll love this.  The 3D is gorgeous, but the tablet's native resolution (2D), will drop dramatically to accommodate the 3D mode (just like it does with passive glasses displays on TVs ). The display will sometimes be dimmer in 3D,  but it varies with each app and its contents. 3D Photos look amazing and you hardly hardly notice the dimming, where as some games it's quite obvious, but again,  depends on the app.  Speaking of which, the game library is not large  yet (I think they're around 100 titles at the time of this review). Some games utilize the 3D intelligently and will leave you impressed, while others are too basic or simply not good.  Gameloft's Asphalt racing & Architect are both samples of top quality on all levels,  and there are few other 3D gaming gems hidden among the crop;  I'm still going through them.<br /><br />Now for some REAL hotness:  I just installed Citra, which is a 3DS emulator with an option for Lume 3D. It's still an early version, but quite a number of games already work excellently! Having 3D on a sharper, larger screen with 3DS gaming - are you kidding me? This is amazing.<br /><br />What I find most impressive are the videos and photographs. It's like, some objects look almost as if they're protruding 4"" off the screen. This baby can convert 8K 2D youtube videos to 3D in seconds , or at most, a minute.  There's so much to try out on youtube and other social media platforms , that you'll realize, there just isn't enough time in a day. The app is called LeiaTube, which is part of a suite of Leia 3D apps including one where you can even take your own impressive 3D photos and videos with the dual lens camera.<br /><br />Some of the other pre-loaded Leia apps for the Lume include a viewer for manipulating thousands of 3D objects, mind-blowing community photos and dozens of well-done educational videos covering a wide range of topics, each pretty lengthy!  Explore everything from the human body,  to heading back in time to ancient Egypt, all in 3D of course.<br /><br />Want to watch blockbuster 3D Movies? You can head to Leiaflix and for $1.99, you'll have a mini 3D theater right on your lap, and the results are impressive and even more exciting is an app on Google Play called Jellyfin. You also have to download the server software for PC or Mac as well as a custom  video player made by a talented individual (check the Leia forums). Now you're able to REMOTELY watch your own 3D videos (and 2D) from your Lume tablet from anywhere in your home over wifi. It's Amazeballs!<br /><br />The tablet uses a USB type C connector. If you purchase one of those multi inputs to C adapters, you can add a hard drive, USB flash or SD cards so you'll be able to transfer items from your expansion storage to the Lume, or you can download Total Commander,  and remotely transfer PC/Mac files to the Lume and the reverse. All from your bed.<br /><br />And finally - two things that are MAJOR surprises --  beyond the 3D itself are the sound and picture quality. When using the tablet in normal 2D (like any Samsung tab), the picture quality is unreal - it actually gives the iPad screen a run for its money.  I mean, this display almost approaches OLED - with crisp, bright and bold colors, and a rich black level. As far sound, we're talking Dolby Atmos. It's the richest sound I've ever heard on any mobile device,  and the build quality is solid, like a tank.<br /><br />So, take away the 3D, and you have one killer tablet on its own. Head to the Google Play Store and go crazy!  I hope enough units sell so this unique tablet gets the support it deserves."
AEHVMGM7F5XV7ZIVECBB345NOO4A,B06XGVQYQZ,5,5,True,"Easy to set up on its stand. System set up was even easier. My PC and PlayStation Pro were immediately detected by the set (I'm using the 40&#34; as a monitor).<br /><br />The picture quality for this price is off the charts, with a black level like velvet and colors just pop. 4K games on PC and PS4 Pro are outstanding and even 1080P looks far superior compared to my 1080p LG TV thanks to upscaling. The built in apps are easy to use and placement is intuitive and fast. Youtube, Netflix and Amazon Prime apps run flawlessly, but keep in mind, not all of their offerings are 4K, but there's already plenty of content with much more on the way; these price drops will surely put 4K into the mainstream.  Youtube has tons of 4K videos that will have you drooling and after a quick set up, HDR is recognized on my PS4 Pro despite the limited color gamut. Seriously, you won't care when you see the screen. As for the included remote, it's super minimalistic, yet does everything you need. A very intelligently-designed remote, despite some reviewers here who don't seem to care for it."

I use 4 webcams and a green screen. I use xSplit exclusively.<br /><br />This C922x Pro Stream is for gamers so they can stream on Twitch or YouTube. The camera is supposed to automatically load a background removing program so you don't have to use a green screen. This special software, Personify ChromaCam, is free when have the C922. Installing is another matter entirely. Myself, like others, have older, but capable systems that cannot install this software. I checked on Personify's website and the PC requirements are: Processor: Intel 4th generation or higher Core CPU, or the AMD equivalent (Quad core AMD Phenom), OS: Windows 7, 8, 10, and Memory: 4GB+ RAM. My system, even though its 3 years old, meets all these specs but when installing I get a 'unable to install due to ABX or ADX&#34; something.<br /><br />The camera's clarity is not any better than my 4 year old C910. In fact, my C910 has Carl Zeiss, the new cam doesn't not. The colors appear washed out with too much brightness. I expected better, but the C922 regressed a bit in the lens department.<br /><br />Now here's a kicker for you...you cannot, and I mean, cannot, view the camera while changing it's settings. Yes, you heard me right. Open the camera settings and you get a windowed box for changing the settings, but the webcam does not come on or is it viewable. So, am I supposed to change the settings, open the cam, close the cam, change the settings, open the cam...etc..etc?<br /><br />The mount is sturdy and multi-positional. I like the added tripod adapter. At this price point there should be a privacy shield.<br /><br />I had an issue getting the camera to initially turn on. The outer ring would flash but no camera picture. Then I realized that some webcams don't like being plugged into a USB hub. After adding an extension cord and plugging in directly to my PC the cam worked.<br /><br />The big question...is this camera worth the $50 more than the entry level C920 series camera? For the money you get a ChromaCam program which may or may not work and you get 6 months free xSplit service. Hmmmmm...OBS, which is quite capable, is a free service.<br /><br />Logitech has so many choices lately, each with increased pricing. Let's face it, it's all about the price. Do you really need your ugly mug put up in a live game? Probably not since it's going to use PC resources that would be better used for gaming. For the $50 extra you could get a couple decent games, or a new mouse, or a mouse pad, or a boat load of peanuts.<br /><br />The choice is yours."

Except the background music, which was deafening on any standard definition commercial that came over my high definition satellite box.<br /><br />It was so bad, I turned on the closed captioning and just left it there.<br /><br />I should mention that I am not deaf.<br /><br />Anyway, I saw this sound bar and thought I would give it a try. One thing I hadn't figured on is that the bad tv doesn't have an optical output, but luckily, this has an analog input. And comes with a cable. I plugged it in, turned it on, and all of a sudden, my tv world is alive. Thoroughly clean clear sound - dialogue, music, all good. The presets are good - I didn't have any need to mess with the equalizer - the sound bar to ally solved my problem. Bluetooth pairs easily with my computer and my iPad.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like is the remote. A bit bigger than a credit card - buttons are hard to push and you can't see a thing in the dark. Good luck setting the sleep timer. Still, the overall experience with this sound bar is good, especially for a reasonably priced brand (NOTE - the Amazon price for this sound bar as of this writing is under $80). I recommend this product."
AENH6LSB6BM7XLPEYUL43WBOD6JA,B008TO3X4Y,5,3,True,"This led tv is much better than I expected it to be for the price I paid for it.  I was not in the market for a new television, but the one I had in my bedroom died.  It's a small room, and the dead tv was 26 inches.  I started looking for something around that size and stumbled on this one for not too much more than a smaller one.  So, I figured I'd give it a try, and if I liked it, I'd put the 32 inch tv from my living room in the bedroom.<br /><br />Set up was very easy.  I put it together using the stand.  I had enough screws.  They all fit.  You have to screw them all the way in straight, or the tv kind of wobbles on the stand, but once I did that, the thing is very stable.<br /><br />It has one component input, one composite, one antenna, one VGA, and three hdmi, and I'm using all of them.  Very very easy.  the whole thing, including moving the other tv, took half an hour, with the only slight pain being that my late 2010 Mac Mini won't under scan at 1080p, so I had to go to 720p, on the hdmi connection.  I don't even know what any of that means, except that this is what I had to do in order to be able to see my menu bar.<br /><br />Picture is really nice for the price, even my little intel atom its box over the VGA looks good.  What impressed me most is the sound.  I only use the tv's speakers for the Wii U, and they are surprisingly clear.  I'm still figuring out some of the settings, but up and running in half an hour and enjoying the results is pretty amazing - especially for the price."

AF5GEEPFQGSURHA4NOG77IZBJDPQ,B01K1IO3QW,1,2,True,"Definitely falls into the category of &#34;you get what you pay for&#34;. This Intel Core i3-based laptop is astonishingly, agonizingly slow. I bought this to replace a 7 year-old MacBook Pro that had served well, but didn't have the horsepower to run the latest version of OS X. This Acer is only marginally faster than the MacBook, and feels slower in may respects. It's glacially sluggish to start-up or restart, and Excel and Word crawl along at speeds reminiscent of 1980s era PCs. Browser speeds - Chrome, IE, and the execrable Edge - all range from stagnant to plodding.<br /><br />Other, more minor, negatives: the track pad might as well be 50 shades of gray, because it requires an extremely firm touch. The PC case is some form of black plastic that shows every fingerprint and smudge, all of which are impossible to remove.<br /><br />I'm hoping for a day-after-Thanksgiving miracle deal to replace this cinder block of a PC.<br /><br />Update 08.16.2017: Acer contacted me after this review was posted (big plus), and opened a case. They called me less than 24 hours after the case was opened (another big plus), but they had my laptop registered to someone else and I had to call them back when I had the laptop in front of me. The person I spoke with had me shutdown the laptop, and use a utility to reset system configurations to the default. When I restarted the computer, the performance had not improved. The support person commented that the laptop only has 4 GB of memory, which apparently makes it unsuited to running Excel. Acer sold the computer with this configuration, and no mention of not being able to run the MS Office suite (or open more than one tab on a browser). He then suggested wiping the computer and resetting it to the original state. I'm not willing to invest any more time in this laptop. Thanks to Acer for contacting me, but this one-star review stands. No more Acer products for me."

I especially like artrage.  Also the bamboo dock has some pretty nice drawing programs.  My only regret is that it will not work on my old G4 iBook.

AHEK4SFYR44XN7CXMGJKXDDKNXPA,B0177GTTB0,1,0,True,"I heard so many good things about Cryorig until I actually bought one of their products and boy was I disappointed. My first experience with Cryorig is with the M9i Mini Tower Cooler for Intel. I'm not sure but is it supposed to be able to move back and forth once the two arms are screwed down? When I say &#34;back and forth&#34; I mean you can literally rock it from the back or the front of the motherboard.<br /><br />I found it extremely difficult to work with this cooler. I had to lift the motherboard to make with the four long stem screws stay in place with the bracket with I go to put the cooler on. Again, is that supposed to be happening? I saw the official how to video that Cryorig put out and that is not at all how I did it.<br /><br />Usually, once all four screws are securely tighten with the nuts on the two arms, I can lift the motherboard by lifting from the arms and I wouldn't be able to rock any part of what I have screwed down. This is a major design flaw that I can't believe not too many people are complaining so that not another person is going to have this bad experience.<br /><br />I'm sending this back and getting an Noctua. You've lost a customer for life CRYORIG. I'm staying away from you products because thank god I was going to get the Cryorig C7 CR-C7A. Pretty sure there's going to be a design flaw in that too."

This cooler doesn't cool anything and it doesn't fit over two of my 1155 motherboards (ASUS P8H77-M PRO and ASUS P8H61-I LX R2). I don't even know if it made contact with my cpu. My 2600k cpu was idling in the 50s and at full load was around 70s. I wasn't even overclocking and my ram was running at 1333.

AHEK4SFYR44XN7CXMGJKXDDKNXPA,B00691WMJG,1,7,True,"This drive is not that fast and it freezes the computer too. Copying files to this drive would get the same speed from any drive that is either SATA 3G, SATA 6G or even from a SATA adapter card. Imagine 5400 16mb on IDE speed. And let me tell you about installation of Adobe Master Collection CS5.5 after a clean OS installation. It would stop, freeze and even give an error message or two. Installing Adobe to other regular SATA drives is fine. It isn't just Adobe either. I don't think this drive is meant to be run as your Operating System if it freezes all the time like this and give this kind or read and write speed. My bios is set to AHCI for the SATA controller and running on the Intel driver for the IDE ATA/ATAPI controller so it isn't my computer that is causing the problems I just mentioned. Formatting the drive was easy. You can just use the latest Maxtor MaxBlast 5 and it will format fine. In fact they suggested that on their own website for formatting and cloning.<br /><br />This drive is going back this week as soon as I can clone the ISO onto another drive so that I don't have to reinstall everything. This is a great shame because I had great hope for this product. But then again Seagate has never been my favorite company for hard drives.<br /><br />P.S. I installed this on a desktop with BOXDH67BLB3 motherboard, a 2600k CPU and 16 gb of RAM. The hard drive was connected directly to a SATA 6G port on the motherboard which showed no sign of the kind of speed I was expecting from the spec this drive supposed to have."
AFLBXUYISXFQ7FVFU7TJ6PPATVHQ,B06WD61CF5,5,302,True,"This will be a fairly detailed and honest review.<br /><br />1. Who is this for?<br />This computer is what I would consider a gateway computer. Those who are looking at upgrading a fairly old or not so powerful laptop and are looking to do a little more productivity, this is a great option.<br /><br />2. What do you get?<br />Well you can probably read the description, however it's worth noting. You get an Intel i7 7500u CPU (dual core with 4 threads) 12gb DDR4 RAM, Nvidia 940mx GPU, a 256gb SSD, 15.6&#34; 1080p screen, fingerprint reader, and a backlit keyboard.<br /><br />The reason I mention all of the feautures is because you would be hardpressed to find another laptop with these features for the same price. To my knowledge there is not laptop on the market for $800 with an i7, dedicated graphics, 12gb of RAM and an SSD. This is really one of the best values on the market right now.<br /><br />With all of that said, this isn't for everyone. If you want to do extensive gaming, this is not for you. Can it game? Yes, light gaming can be achieved, however it isn't marketed as a gaming laptop. Is this for someone who wants to do editing (video, audio, photos)? Yes, again light editing can be achieved.<br /><br />What blew me away with this computer is the speakers! They are fantastic! I usually use headphones and would consider myself somewhat picky with sound, and for laptop speakers these are really something great.<br /><br />This computer is really a middle of the pack all arounders dream. If you dabble in a little of this and a little of that but don't do anything professionally or extremely serious, this is really all you need.<br /><br />Also, everyone's experience is different. Some hate loud fans, and if this is pushed the fans will be audible. Some don't like that the backlit keyboard times out after 30 seconds of no use. These things really don't bother me.<br /><br />Lastly, the versatility of this laptop is really great. I've bought tablets and sold them because I couldn't justify having a laptop and tablet, then bought tablets again because I missed the things I could do with them that I was missing on a laptop. This solved all of those issues except size. It's pretty big, which for some is a plus others its not.<br /><br />Overall, if you are looking at upgrading and don't want to spend $1,200-2,000 on a flagship model laptop this is a great option! I can't recommend this enough."
AF7PWHAYMHBUQ7XHT43UFNJ5HKHQ,B076ZXHM3L,5,0,True,Arrived promptly and worked fine with our Intel DB43LD motherboard.
AFHQWKMOOHSDODJI7A4TRGXBC3LA,B002G392ZI,1,3,True,Far worse than the AMD 8350's included cooler. I guess the small contact surface designed for Intel chips makes this cooler useless for AMD chips which have a larger surface area. Maybe this works ok for Intel chips but is totally useless for AMD chips.
AFHQWKMOOHSDODJI7A4TRGXBC3LA,B005O65JXI,5,0,True,"Boy is this big. Fortunately it fits just barely in my Sentey Gaming case. I had purchased the Arctic Freezer 7 Pro Rev 2 but that was far worse than the AMD 8350's included cooler fan, probably because the contact surface is designed for Intel chips and is much smaller than for AMD chips.<br />Be prepared for some work installing this fan as you have to install a new back-plate on the motherboard. The included parts are perfect in that they provide everything you will need including the thermal compound. So I also purchased the 2 top case fans (Corsair series). Without the cooler, the top fans did indeed reduce the top CPU temperatures by about 4C degrees - almost as though the case cover is open. With the cooler though the CPU temperature never climbed beyond 61C degrees even when all 8 cores were saturated (was compiling code). Without the cooler and the the top fans I was hitting 70C degrees which is 5 degrees above allowed operating temperature. I am surprised my AMD 8350 is still operational. With the cooler and top fans the temperature drop is 15C which is a win! Maybe I can use the Arcrtic Freezer in an Intel setup."
AGXA47OGAYZ5GXUMJ2OKZMPRTXUA,B015TNNZIG,5,15,True,"So far, so good. If you have never installed components like this before, it is not impossible, but replacing a CPU is not as straightforward as popping in a new video card or RAM. Do your homework, research thoroughly, and watch some videos. If you're buying a CPU upgrade, I'm sure you're already familiar with the research and review process, but definitely do your homework on the system you intend to use it with. Also, don't forget to buy some good thermal paste (such as [[ASIN:B002CQU14A Noctua NT-H1 Thermal Compound - Retail]], or something similar) if you don't already have some.<br /><br />I happen to be using this on a Mac Pro 5,1 (mid-2010) tower, replacing my stock 2.8 GHz processor. The X5690 was a tested option for this range of model, so all reviews pointed to success. After installing, I went ahead and ran the Intel Processor Diagnostic Tool (free from the Intel web site), which passed all default tests.<br /><br />I haven't put it through anything too rough, so I will update in the future if anything changes, but the operating systems seem happy, and I am pleased so far!"
AGO6RBHKEFEJAAA4TUXYE7J47IKA,B00FCKAW1U,5,5,True,"Day 1<br /><br />Today I took delivery of the Acer TravelMate B. I bought this specifically because I read a blog post from a school which deployed these to their students with Ubuntu rather than Windows. They mentioned the light weight, good processing power and long battery life. I looked into the specific model used in the deployment, and it is this machine.<br /><br />I had to change a few settings in the BIOS for Linux to work, which was not hard at all. In fact I found several other BIOS features that I would like to have changed while there.<br /><br />I installed CentOS 6.5, which is a clone of RHEL 6.5. Once that was installed I started to add an additional repository and then started configuring all the apps I normally use.<br /><br />So far the machine is beating my slightly older Dell Studio XPS ultrabook. It's a tiny bit heavier, but the battery should last much longer. I actually prefer a hard drive over an SSD. The cost and high capacity is at an all time high. This drive has 500 GBs so it is fine for storing a lot of media if that's your thing. The dual core i3 runs 4 threads. 4 GBs of ram is small, but for Linux it is fine.<br /><br />The graphics are intel HD 4000 by the way. So I believe this is a 4th gen intel CPU. I have not tested the full time on the battery under Linux just yet. That should take a while. Hoping to get those 7 advertised hours. We'll see."
AFHER2NWLJQHNQ4BRB4NZAG46VCQ,B005UBNL0A,4,3,True,"My old computer was exactly that:  Old!  It needed some serious work.  I was running an Athlon X2 6000+ and an EVGA 9800GT.  It was a great system back in the day!  But, time took its toll.  I was kicking around the idea of getting an Intel i3, since they seem to edge out this chip, and are competitively priced (I never overclock my equipment, so it's at stock settings.)  But the future upgradability seemed like it'd be very costly.  Over all, this chip performs just fine.  I mainly upgraded so I could play Diablo 3, and with an EVGA 550 Ti, I play it on high settings, and it looks as good as I could want it to look.  My old machine did just fine with standard productivity stuff, but I wanted to play games that were more recent than WoW.  I'm able to do everything I want, with no signs of a lag.  If I need to upgrade, I'm banking that the next generation of this chip will see some improvements (though the improvement I'm seeing from my last CPU is leaps-and bounds!)  The AM3+ socket will be around for a while.  Over all, this is a great chip, and easy on the wallet.<br /><br />**Update 9/6/12**<br />I recently purchased Guild Wars 2.  The game is fairly CPU-intensive, but the FX-4100 keeps up just fine!  I think I'm sitting at around 50% plus load at any given time during actual game play on all four cores.

Again, all four cores are loaded, and quite frequently, they're over 60%.  Things get a little warm (35C or so) when compared to when I run other applications.  Nothing to worry about!<br /><br />I have also paid quite a bit of attention to how it runs with Diablo 3.  It only uses 2 cores at about 50% load at any given time.  That game is more GPU-intensive.  I am still very happy with my purchase!"

I don't plan on using it for any intensive applications, so the C50 CPU seems like it'll do fine with whatever I throw at it.  Netflix streams perfectly fine in HD, and since it has a true 720p screen (1366x768,) the pictures aren't cut off at all!  Just to see how it'd handle, I downloaded Torchlight and it ran just fine in full resolution with moderate graphics settings.<br /><br />Some users claim this machine will need a RAM upgrade right out of the box, but I found that it idles at about .7GB out of the 1.75GB available (The GPU has .25GB dedicated to it all the time,) so those who plan on using it for internet-only will do just fine with the 2GB.<br /><br />One thing I noticed that concerned me, at first, is the core temps.  It idles in an air conditioned room at about 65C, and when it is put to work, it'll shoot up to about 81C.

All of which I've run at 1366x768 or 1280x720 resolution, depending on what the game could handle, with moderate to high graphics settings.  The machine gets a bit warm on the left hand side, but the games run just fine!  I've also streamed several movies on Netflix, and this little guy handles them like a champ!  My work also requires me to work with fairly massive spreadsheets from MS Excel, and the only problem I have with them on this netbook is the screen size.  I also upgraded the RAM to 4GB on impulse, and noticed no real improvement, which is what I expected based on what I noticed before (I am running closer to 1.2GB while idling now, however...  probably something I installed and forgot about.)  One of my favorite features is the low power consumption.  The wall-wart is rated for 40W, but I found reports that this thing peaks out at under 30W, so it's basically like using a small light bulb and not a small appliance (like a desktop PC!)

The ability to have multiple user accounts on the tablet, which is a Kit Kat native option, is turned off by the manufacturer. They cannot turn it back on - according to their tech support. They did say if it was the right serial number, there was a software change they could send me, but since the serial number is on a sticker at the hottest part of the table, and where ANY normal use would require holding it, that number didn't last more than a week. This ONE missing feature is almost a non-starter, but since I bought it and it's not junk, it's really too late to not start. For shame turning this feature off. It seriously irks me. Suggested options include rooting. Good luck. I spent hours looking in the XDA and other android forums for a way to do it. No such luck. I found ONE thread claiming it was easy with xyz method. I didn't find that to be the case.<br /><br />The Y88X is very light and very slim. It does feel a tad flimsy because of that and the fact that the shell seems like a slightly thinner than expected plastic. The screen is also not very hard. It flexes.<br /><br />Charge life is ok. I'd say it should last a full day on a single charge with a few hours of gaming (not 3D/processor exhaustive).<br /><br />The viewing angle in landscape mode is generally perfectly fine. The viewing angle in portrait mode is terrible. Actually, if you tilt it down, the angle is ok, if you tilt it up, it gives a posterized look to it. Not particularly visually useful.<br /><br />The cameras are TERRIBLE. Really bad. My Canon Powershot from 1999 that only took .3M pictures did a better job that this, and I'm not exaggerating. Both cameras are blurry and slow. A secondary purpose for this was to use it for a wall mounted weather station with the capability to be a skype/video chat option for the house. I'm sure it'll suffice, but only just.<br /><br />One nice thing was that it came with a screen protector already on it. Unfortunately, it wasn't put on with any care and has bubbles in a bunch of places. No one else in the house seems to care, so I'm not going to worry about it.<br /><br />There is a problem with touching the screen around the edges. It's hit or miss at times.<br /><br />My screen also came with two blemishes on it that are more noticeable when the background is lighter.<br /><br />There is a bright side. It CAN be snappy with many apps. It streams netflix and casts to the Chromecast just great. Having access to a microsd slot makes the memory limitation it starts with not a big deal (wish the Nexus has one). The CPU seems perfectly capable of keeping up. I've not tried high needs games, but we don't generally do those on the tablets anyway. It does multitask, but the limitations show in the form of jolting screen changes and slow transitions. It is a low ram device, so this should be no surprise. Just kill some apps and move on.<br /><br />My 5 year old doesn't notice or care about how it's not as nice as the Nexus, so that's fine to me as well. Some have described this as a good tablet for kids. I'd say it just fine for someone with lower expectations. Most adults I know with tablets are not power users, they just think they are. If the issues I brought up don't bother you, this is likely a good choice for you. I wouldn't specifically recommend it to a friend, but if they really only had $60 to spend, I'd say this is an option they can live with. If I had another $30+ to spend, I'd have looked for something else.<br /><br />-- 4/29/15 edit<br />I forgot to mention that the included wall wart adapter for charging has NEVER worked right. I have USB plugs I use for other devices, so it's not a huge deal, but it's a serious flaw, like the plug doesn't fit right. The battery icon flashes from charge to not charging. It does interfere with my wanting to mount it on a wall and not use up another long USB cable.<br /><br />Also, in the last few weeks, my son has nearly lost his mind at how the tablet doesn't work right when he's playing Temple Run 2. It might be an issue with other games/activities, but this one relies on timing and swiping that he finds from time to time are not being picked up. I tried and found the same thing. I'd restart the tablet and sometimes it was better, other times it was not, even when killing all non-essential background processes. Hearing a VERY intelligent 5 year old say &#34;it's not doing what I tell it to do&#34;, &#34;this is not fair&#34; really hurts. He's right. TR2 isn't exactly high end gaming, so something else it wrong.<br /><br />I'm not clear on how the flash memory is split up on this either. There isn't a lot of apps installed, but it ran out of space. I'll need to throw in a microSD card soon and hopefully apps can be moved over without hassle. The device storage says there's over a gig of space in one location, far more than enough for a &#60;50Mb app to be installed."
AFUK6B5ZSGP4BFLJWKJRIXD3GGYQ,B007BY57Y2,4,6,True,"I'll update later. First thing I did was toy with it a little to make sure it worked, then I installed Ubuntu 12.04. THEN I found out that there are not reliable drivers for using the optimus feature in linux. I went with this laptop so that I can play one game in particular. After spending HOURS tweeking, installing and experimenting, I'm at the point where I can say, if you plan on using this machine for linux AND gaming, either walk on by, or plan on dual booting or running a virtual machine (which one I've not decided I'll do yet). I THINK if there was the ability in the BIOS to turn off the intel graphics card in favor of only using the nvidia, that might be helpful.<br />The design is nice, it's fast and it may be heavy by today's standards, but compared to the Dell d810 I'm replacing, this is light.<br />The price point is, as stated by many before, excellent.<br /><br />I take away the star for the simple fact that it's FAR too late in the game for nvidia to not have appropriate drivers to support this card fully in linux.<br /><br />I do NOT want to run windows 7, but it looks like I'll be recovering it and spending hours decrapifying.<br /><br />Update: May, 14, 2012<br />I've now had the laptop running a dual boot of Ubuntu 12.04 and Windows 7. I initially tried to just run Ubuntu and gave up on the driver debacle - fail for nvidia - and went back to reinstall. Major advice, when you get this machine, BOOT IT AND MAKE THE RECOVERY DVD SET!!! It took 4 DVDs and actually a little while, but it was the best move. When I went to recover W7, it did not properly use the recovery partition. The DVDs rebuild the partition (and destroy everything else in the process) back to factory. That was ok for me, I was testing and didn't lose anything worth saving.<br /><br />Boot is fast. Ubuntu shuts down super fast, so the time to switch isn't bad. I play my game (Lord of the Rings Online - mostly set as ultra settings) quit and reboot into linux so I can enjoy my daily computing experience.<br /><br />The plus other mention is the full HD experience. My previous laptop did 1900x100. I miss the vertical resolution, but am getting used to only having 1080. The screen is great. I do not understand why people like the glossy/glare screens. I hate them. This is pretty matte.<br /><br />Temperature-wise it runs lap-top ok. The left side vent blows warm/hot air, which was actually nice on my hand in the cold basement during gaming (I'm a lefty - using a mouse).<br /><br />I'm getting used to the keyboard. I often find it misses some of my key strokes, but I might just need to MEAN them a little more, as I tend to type with a softer touch. This makes the typing experience a little louder than I prefer, but my wife doesn't complain, so it can't be that bad.<br /><br />I'm a tad less fond of the USB placement. They are toward the front of the sides, which means the USB plugs are close to all my business. If I had the RJ45 connected as well, it would be more annoying wires up close and personal.<br /><br />As or resources, it feels perfectly adequate for my needs. This weekend I was running about 60 firefox tabs, 10 chrome tabs, a handful of libre office documents, Redblade 3.5 (D&D character generator) running twice via wine, about 15 20-50MB PDFs, ktorrent, and a few other things here and there concurrently without a hiccup. Eventually, maybe I'll upgrade to more ram, but I cannot currently see any reason for it. I also can't see a particular reason to plunk down for a SSD. I imagine the power saving would be nice. I do get only around 2-2.5 hours of regular use off power, but since this is a desktop replacement, that's less of an issue. If it was less than 1.5 hrs, I'd be troubled.<br /><br />The quickboot option boots into an OS experience for basic web browsing, some games, IM... I suppose the most basic of what a netbook would be for. In a pinch, it's FAST to get into and connects to wifi quickly. Navigating is funky, but it's not meant for full on use - otherwise you blew $900 on a pretty low end experience.<br /><br />I still deduct the star almost exclusively for the video drivers issue and the inability to select which video to use in the BIOS. If I could run from the nvidia, I believe there wouldn't be the issues with driver support in linux, as the GPU is supported - it's the switching that's picky."
AGCCVLRPZNIPCIE3KPK6724UFDVQ,B005IOLEJO,5,0,True,WOW!  I had an Intel stock fan for years and years. It ran in the upper 140 deg F range when idle. I had to replace it due to age. I put the Arctic Freezer 13 CO in hoping to reduce the temp by maybe 15 to 20 deg F at most. Well..... I was shocked when the temp at idle was showing 86 deg F. I thought that the sensor was damaged. After checking around I verified it was indeed in the 80's. This fan far exceeded my expectations
AGNNPO2GX24EVBHAEMEVVAUGPECQ,B071R6JRZZ,5,8,True,"Oct. 2020: If you're photographing foliage with a lot of stems & leaf edges, turn off/down i.Resolution. The ""i"" isn't that intelligent & makes some nasty over-sharpened halos in some spots. My advice, if you like the overall look of the jpeg, shoot raw+jpeg & process the raw using the jpeg as a guide. This isn't needed all the time. Only some scenes have this problem.<br />8/14/2020 I never played with the weird 4K burst modes. I just mucked with them today. They tend to hang up the camera. They don't seem to offer much over the regular drive modes. They take up two programmable buttons I can put to better use.<br />7/18/2019 Low light. No camera of this type is going to do well in natural light at last light (9 PM here.) This one is noticeably worse than my SX720HS. And that's bad.<br />6/29/2019 With an upgraded SD card, I tried the high speed video. The 240 fps VGA mode worked like a dream. To access it, you have to have the camera on [Cinema Camera]M mode. WARNING: Objects in camera fall 1/8th as fast as real life. :)<br />6/24/2019. With hundreds of pictures down, I really like the flip screen. I also like the auto bracket. I tend to keep it on 1/3 stop; 2/3 seems to be a bit wide. I've turned off the touch screen. Moving the focus position with the tip of my nose whenever I use the EVF is right out.<br />6/21/2019. Video playback seems to be twitchy on this model. Apparently some cameras, some times have trouble playing back some videos. Check your memory card specs. Even with a high end card, playback is chancy. Recording is fine. Playback on a PC is fine.<br /><br />6/17/2019. The only serious negative about this camera is the slight increase in size and weight over my old SX720HS. It's about twice the volume. It has reasons for that, with the added features, particularly the tilt-screen and the EVF.<br /><br />I really like high-end, 1/2.3""-sensor, long-zoom, point & shoot cameras. This one is pretty close to the limit. Much more and you have to go to 1"" sensor designs, which hurts your zoom range. I currently have:<br />-Canon SX280HS--great camera, still has features no one else has, terrible for videos (I don't care), battery hog (I do care)<br />-Canon SX720HS--basically the SX280HS perfected. I wouldn't normally upgrade this soon, but for,<br />-Panasonic ZS70--this camera, which I got for very short money (thanks Amazon warehouse)<br /><br />* I wasn't that interested in the  flip-up screen, I don't do selfies or vlogs. Boy was I wrong. It allows you to snake the camera into positions that would otherwise require a contortionist.<br />* I was interested in the EVF. It's good in dim light, but I'm used to eyeballing pictures from an external screen. Still a plus, but less of one than I thought.<br />* I was interested in the powerful bracketing functions. Still interested, but I'll need a bit more study to make it work.<br /><br />Generally, I shoot in P mode or M mode. Both modes work fine on this camera. The autofocus is better than on the two Canons. The focus modes take a little experimentation to find the one that works best for you, but they all seem to work. 'Standard' color balance is fine. I need to play with 'Natural' a bit to see which one I prefer. The attached photos were all taken on standard. All on a single sunny morning walk after a rainy night in Massachusetts.<br /><br />First impression? This is a really good camera, even at the list price."
AGNNPO2GX24EVBHAEMEVVAUGPECQ,B009CQOXTW,4,1,True,"My 17"" HP laptop died (CPU failure) and it really wasn't worth fixing. I looked around for a replacement and came up with this. I didn't really need another laptop, and the 20"" screen on this all-in-one desktop seemed like it would be a big improvement.<br /><br />And it was. And the touchscreen offers some extra ways of doing things that keep you from death-gripping a mouse and getting carpal tunnel syndrome. 1 TB of disk and 6 GB of memory makes it much faster than the old laptop, as does an Intel i3 vs. an AMD Turion 2 on the laptop.<br /><br />All-in-all, the all-in-one is a very nice computer. Only having to hook up two wires (power and network) was most pleasant compared to previous desktops. I'm even getting used to the slightly cheesy wireless keyboard. Other reviewers have noted that the lack of a caps-lock light on the keyboard is a negative, but not a huge one for me. Since my laptop died from CPU failure, the hard drive was fine. I have an eSATA drive enclosure, so file transfer wasn't too onerous. Setting up and using the hardware was a cinch.<br /><br />Windows 8, not so much. This machine is not suited for the Windows 8 notMetro (""Modern""*) UI because of the large screen. Take heart, though, you can arrange the ""Desktop"" button to take you back in time to Windows 7, or a close approximation thereof. After trying to be a good Windows 8 person, I gave up and installed a Start button replacement. There are several. The first one I'm trying is StartW8, which seems good enough. I may try a few more if this one annoys me, but for now, it's nice. If you want a computer specifically for W8 notMetro, get a tablet. The tiled interface should make a lot of sense there. MS really needs to offer a desktop-specific version of W8 with a more mundane UI. For now, though, do it yourself.<br /><br />With that caveat, I recommend this computer. I haven't had it long enough to comment on durability, but after a month, so far, so good.<br /><br />5 July 2013: The basic system is still working well. I finally settled on HP's Quick Start start menu replacement. It's simple and works well. The only negative item is the cheesy wireless keyboard. Eventually (i.e., today) I got tired of its lousy response, repeated letters and cheap feel. I dug out my old Dell L100 USB keyboard[[ASIN:B0037H8AB4 NEW, DELL USB L-100, SK-8115, RT7D50, KEYBOARD, 104 KEYS]] and hooked it up. Ahhh! The L100 has outlasted several computers and may outlast many more. It's small, sturdy and well laid-out. With this change to a Dell keyboard, I'm very satisfied with the HP computer.<br />_____________________<br /><br />*Yo! Redmond Microserfs!

AGTEQ7226PHLUHPE3G6NOHKFFETQ,B071CFC3RG,4,15,True,"This is an amazing tablet for its price.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that this is my first tablet, but I have messed around with a Wacom bamboo at a friend’s house. Based on that small experience, and how I’ve felt about the Huion so far, these are the pro’s and con’s<br /><br />PROS:<br />• the price!! This tablet is dirt cheap compared to a Wacom with this size and pressure sensitivity<br />• the size. I didn’t realize how big 11 inches was until I opened the package. To put it in perspective, the drawing space is about an inch longer than a piece of standard paper and maybe a half and inch less wide.<br />• the sensitivity— it’s above 8000 levels, so as you can imagine, it’s pretty stellar<br />• extra nibs and pen holder! I like that it came with 8 extra nibs and that they all fit inside of the pen holder. It added an organized and professional touch. The holder has a weighted bottom so it won’t topple over when the pen is in it, and the holder has a mechanism to remove worn out nibs as well. It’s just nifty<br /><br />The quick keys seem like they would be convenient but since this is my first tablet I haven’t thought to do anything with them really. I like the shortcut buttons on the pen a lot however<br /><br />CONS:<br />• as everyone has mentioned: the drivers. Really, it’s not a huge setback given the low price and the fact that once it’s working, it is WORKING, but I have a frequent problem where the pressure sensitivity will not work when I boot things up. Sometimes the fix is as simple as opening the huion tablet application, sometimes I have to reinstall the drivers. It’s a pain<br />• the speed. Once I had been drawing with it for a bit it wasn’t nearly as noticeable as at first, but there is a bit of a lag with hand movement and the movement of the cursor on screen. There are also times when it will skip when I’m using it as a mouse, but when drawing, so far no skipping. (I use it with an Intel i5 powered Lenovo Ideapad 330 on Krita)<br />• if you have the pen plugged in, like someone else said, you can’t have it in the pen stand. It’s just a little odd though, not a real con<br /><br />Notes:<br />• it has a very smooth slightly papery finish on the drawing area.<br />• my laptop is 17.3in and I can lay the tablet on my keyboard and have it almost match the width.<br />• it easily gets little greasy marks on it, I guess from hands.<br />The box it comes in is pretty nice, everything is in its own chic black box and it’s all packed down neatly. It seemed padded enough as well.<br />• there is a USB plug for your computer to enable a wireless connection and there is no place within the set to store it, so I’m afraid of losing it, make sure you either keep it plugged I to your computer, or have a safe place for it.<br /><br />Should I have any more thoughts as I continue usage, I will update"
AEB2MZFZEQ4TVI4I2VZ4B2VTMMBQ,B002GHLG7G,5,4,False,"I've been using this on a Win7 laptop (P8400 core2 duo, 2.26ghz), along with other ""native"" plugins. Without the UAD-2 Solo, my cpu would have been at 100% utilization a couple of dozen Fx instances ago.  This card ""runs"" the plugins, freeing your cpu for your DAW software.  Using just the laptop's CPU, each instance of a plugin processor or instrument sucks more CPU, at some point causing noisy artifacts (pops/crackles), dropouts, latency issues, etc..  This card is a GREAT BUY, and includes some prominent, highly rated processor plugins with purchase.  It makes my laptop a far more powerful DAW than if I used strictly ""native"" plugins, e.g. Waves (which are mostly excellent, btw).  I do have some Waves plugins as well.  Before deciding to go with just your CPU, simply Google ""UAD-2 SOLO review"" and see what the many reviewers have to say about this new DSP Accelerator.  Several forums will give an idea of the many users who are already using it, with Win XP and beyond (as well as OS/X).<br /><br />Installation/Compatibility:<br />I know of MANY PC users still running XP sp2 that use the UAD-2 Solo card (or even earlier UAD PCIe accelerators who LOVE them!).  The SOLO has been out for 2 years now, and been installed on MANY XP/sp2 systems.  Pretty sure that some had to upgrade (ExpressCard) drivers, or their laptop BIOS.  Even when using a new Audio interface (USB/Firewire), this is often required.  Some call it ""maintenance"", and it's generally a good thing, to update the software that supports hardware as it get's ""older"" (1.5 - 2 years, let's be honest).  Hardware drivers and bios' are upgraded (improved; bugs fixed), and installing these is, sometimes, as important as installing patches to Windows or any OS (esp. for a laptop in which the card slot was perhaps  never used).  Laptop manufacturers issue updates for the drivers for _fingerprint readers_, for SD Card readers, etc...  It is normal.  In a case where a SOLO card needs configuration mods, or driver updates in order to work, this would be an issue with the _laptop_, not with the new ExpressCard item you are trying to use.  Nowadays, flashing BIOS or upgrading drivers is quite easy, and to be expected if adding hardware or peripherals to your machine.  Even PC CHIPSETS (e.g. Intel 45 Express) have upgrades issued sometimes, allowing support for faster, more powerful CPUs, etc.. that didn't exist when the chipset was built.  Bottom line: When adding/upgrading hardware, you may have to tweak, modify or upgrade software.  This is the nature of the beast.  :)<br /><br />As for UAD software:<br />UAD plugins are among the most highly rated software plugins you can buy.  Many are designed by, or in collaboration with, the designers of the ORIGINAL HARDWARE being emulated; The Neve console/etc plugins are endorsed by Rupert Neve; Empirical Labs' designer Dave Derr endorses the Fatso Jr (and other) UAD-2 plugins.  Not that many plugin processor/emulator offerings have such endorsements."

I have tried adjusting every single setting and the monitor is just not as bright as I would like. Now, I don’t really notice if I’m watching a movie or show, mainly when I’m writing or using any program with a lot of whitespace.<br /><br />The monitor does have two built-in Eye Care options, Low and High, which are easy to select through the control panel buttons.<br /><br />The base of the monitor is BIG and takes up a good portion of my desk. The base is a solid rectangle measuring 12 inches by 9 inches. My desk mat curls up over the base and the base cuts into my mouse space. Most of the weight comes from the base, the screen itself is pretty light. Too light -- the monitor quivers on my desk with every movement I make. This might not seem like a big problem, but it gets annoying when the monitor is shaking just a little bit every time I adjust my position in my chair. Sometimes I use a mechanical keyboard and if I type fast, the monitor shakes. Yeah, it’s great that I can turn the monitor, and adjust the angle and height, but I wish it was steadier on the base.<br /><br />The monitor is 1000R curvature, which is about as much as monitors can currently curve. I have a 1800R curved monitor and the difference is noticeable -- I prefer the greater curve of this Samsung monitor. I find the greater curve more immersive, with less glare and strain during the day. And watching movies just feels cooler.<br /><br />For laptop users like me, using USB-C to connect the monitor means my laptop gets charged, too. The monitor also has 3 USB 3.0 ports on the back, super handy for when I forget my hub or adapters to connect peripherals to my MacBook. Lastly, there’s no big power brick, just a slim power cable, which makes up a bit for the big base."

Let alone go to a website.<br /><br />I’m a semi-patient adult in my 30s and wanted to chuck this laptop against the wall because the initial setup took so long. For an example, I tried to load the system information to find hardware information, and it took SEVEN seconds to open the Start Menu and load System Information.<br /><br />The processor is an Intel(R) Celeron(R) CPU N3350 @ 1.10GHz.

I suppose that’s useful for basic users, but if you want to put another browser on, you have to disable S mode. Once you disable S mode, you can’t go back to it.<br /><br />I thought I’d use this laptop for writing, since it’s so slow to load anything that I wouldn’t be tempted to go online. But I don’t even like typing on it; the keyboard feels like I’m typing on a cardboard box. There’s a hollow plastic sound when I type; it’s *that* flimsy. There are some keyboard shortcuts, but I thought it was odd that there wasn’t a shortcut to adjust the brightness. Considering how long it takes the Start Menu to load, that doesn’t make it easy to change the brightness of the screen.<br /><br />The trackpad is decent, probably the best part of the laptop for me.

The in-app equalizer that is presented after doing the custom audio tuning for your specific hearing is wonderful. I can quickly change my tuning based on application at the touch of a button and the volume level and mixing delivers!<br /><br />Pairing wise, to couldn’t be easier. A dedicated pairing function in which you hold the button into the pairing zone makes so much sense. So many headphones combine the power in function of pairing with powering on that It can become difficult to get the device paired with multiple sources. Brilliant.<br /><br />Smart buttons — this is my only gripe. The option button is a mute if you’re in a phone call, but the rest of the time it’s a “intelligent command” button. In my experience things like “play music” yielded “call Tito Hyuan” Instead. I’m going to contact Jabra and try to understand better.<br /><br />Charging... this is a shine. 10 minutes gets you 15 hours. Enough to go make a pot of coffee and work for the day. Perfect.<br /><br />Outside of that, the Jabra app shines. My favorite feature is the soundscapes to tune out ambient noise.

If you value appearance and can live with only basic functionality, this hybrid watch Micheal Kors is the ticket. appearance wise, the watch looks like a classic analog watch. It has a sporty, somewhat understated moto feel. The black ddial is chic and the silver markings are chic. the black silicone band is comfortable. I was concerned it would be to hot but so far it has been fine. The watch itself is big but not ridiculously.  the case measures 47 mm (1.85 inches roughly) and 13 mm, (just over a half inch thick). It is battery operated so one need not add to the pile of devices that required nightly charging. The battery shold last up to six months depending on use and it is water resistant.<br /><br />In the box comes the watch, a useless quick start guide, a thick warranty booklet, a battery and tool to open the back  separately packaged.<br />to set up you download the app to your phone. It is compatible with both apple and android. The directions are simple to follow and set up was relatively painless. This is a button operated watch. There are three buttons on the side that perform all the functions. They are black but once you get accustomed to the system, easy to use. the bezel does not move. For a smart watch it is not a genius but of average intelligence. It contains an activity tracker (steps walked, calories burned, distance travelled),  and sleep monitor.You can set goals for your activity including water consumption. I found the measurements on a par with my fit bit. There is no heart rate monitor.  It allows you to filter contacts and receive notifications from selected apps and contacts. It can be programmed to control music, take a selfie or ring a connected phone But it can<br /> only perform those functions one at a time. .<br /><br />This watch provides sporty style without being gaudy or ostentatious. The basic functions work well. If you value style and primarily need the notification, activity and music control features, this watch covers the bases. I am not inclined to spend a lot of money on features I will rarely, if ever use, on a piece of wearable tech that has a limited life span. (Let's face it. due to industry advances, all tech has a fairly quick expiration date. there is a bit of a learning curve to master the button and notifications but it is not too complex. as you gain familiarity with it, it becomes second nature.the app is well organized and simple to use.

Option 2 was to shell out three or four times what this fan costs for a slim CPU cooler (my case is quite small) and hope that it works better than the stock Intel cooler.<br /><br />I went with the more budget friendly Option 1, took the time to create the 15mm recess, and am happy to report that my idle temp dropped 15* (33* C vs 48) and after half an hour of CPU torture with Prime95, it was holding steady at 60* C (still 12* shy of the max temp for this CPU).

AEVJ3VDN6XFRRPIEEETVC2FZVFIA,B005TX3LA4,4,24,True,"I was in the market for a case for a thin mini itx system I was building and this one was the cheapest I came across that didn't make me fear for my components.  I read all the reviews I could find and even watched a few YouTube videos and ultimately decided that this was the case for me.  The build went fairly smoothly (no late night trips to find parts I found out I needed at the last minute or incompatibility issues), but I did encounter a few problems which other reviewers had also mentioned and I chose to ignore.<br /><br />First Problem:  Cannot use hdd mount with stock Intel heat sink installed<br />The product description claims this case can accommodate a stock heatsink, which is absolutely true, but if you do use one, a hard drive, even a thin ssd like I used, can't be mounted using the bracket they provided.  I thought I was stuck at this point, and even tried mounting the ssd to the top of the case, but then I noticed some screw holes on the back of the case just above the I/O shield that seemed to be spaced just right for the holes on the side of the ssd.  A few minutes and a little creative drill work later, and I had a place to mount my ssd, no bracket required.<br /><br />Second Problem:  The front panel connectors are way too short<br />My major problem with this case is the front panel connectors.  For a case this small, it seems like it would be easy to include cables long enough to reach from the corner where they connect to the case to the opposite corner, just to be sure there was enough wire no matter what the motherboard setup was.  Minibox did not take this approach, leaving me to splice the wires for the power button with and led with doorbell wire and plug the front two usb connector into a single auxiliary usb header, which only allows one port to work.  It's mainly for this reason that I knocked off a star.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a really nice, well-made case if you're willing to deal with the few problems that it has.  View the attached pictures for a better idea of how I ended up mounting the ssd and a general view of what this case looks like with a system in it.<br /><br />System Components:<br />ECS H81H3-TI2 Thin Mini ITX Motherboard (includes wifi/bluetooth mini PCIe card)<br />Intel Core i3-4160 CPU with stock cooler<br />Kingston 120 GB SSD<br />Universal 90 W PSU"

Is it that bad?  Yes. (Exhibit A. who in the entire human population ever asked Microsoft to get rid of the X button, was this trivial little button causing some unknown global problem?  It's removal is a major concern).  OK, so is this ASUS' fault?  Well, yes, they partook in the KoolAid that says you can't offer a mainstream Windows 7 box anymore.  You can and should, ship it with Windows 8 upgrade if necessary.<br /><br />Back to the ASUS.  I had my reservations because what I really wanted was an MSI GE60 or 70, but was constrained by a business budget.  The major differences (beyond an unnecessarily better video card) were 3: the MSI has a backlit keyboard, 7200rpm drive, and Windows 7.  These differences have all produced regrets.  Every fear of a non-backlit keyboard have been realized here and had I seen this laptop live before buying, this alone would have killed the purchase.  The print on the keys is very thin with poor contrast and tiny alternates, thus very difficult to see.  Why ASUS?  See no reason for this simple oversight.  All of the 6 keyboards in my home are readable in low light.  This one, not so much.  The 5400 drive is slow (confirmed with its lagging score on Windows Experience Index), not sure a 7200 is going to make a remarkable difference, but for now, it's a regret.  And of course Windows 8.<br /><br />Still, initially gave 3-stars because this package more or less delivers what it purports too.  Construction feels good, display looks good, the various spec parts seem to behave well together.  The layout is no-nonsense with a good array of connections.  Bloat-ware was manageable.  The video card surely is not worth the $200 premium over the identical ASUS without it.  Get that Asus for productivity, it is a bargain.<br /><br />Overall, cannot escape the feeling that this laptop is no better than one I could buy 3 years ago, not how I want to feel at this mid-price point.<br /><br />UPDATE: after some unsatisfactory graphics output, checked in to things and am finding that the built-in HD Graphics are being used in conjunction with the installed NVIDIA, often taking precedence over the NVIDIA.  You have little to no control over this, it is Intel likely trying to be smarter than you presumably to save battery.  In most cases it will cross over under load, but you will notice the degradation for a few seconds before the transition, and it is aggravating.  In other cases, the fix never happens.  I have one piece of software that will not allow me to even run a certain function because it says I have no graphics card.  I tried to get around that setting by loading the card down before going into that software.  Then it detects the card.  However, on reboot I am back to ground zero with the function disabled.  Considering the NVIDIA graphics cards raises the price of this laptop $200 over the identical ASUS, it goes without saying that I regret this purchase.<br /><br />I have experienced several freeze ups and a complete failure of the graphics card to run a single 1080 monitor with a modest visualizer.  I have decided to return this an upgrade to an MSI with a better graphics card."

Acer’s Helios 300 and Triton 500 are the best price/performance ratio for gaming around right now.<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />Changed the base speed of the CPU when plugged in to 2.2GHz under power options, advanced settings, intel dynamic platform and thermal framework, config TDP level to maximize CPU potential when its plugged in.<br /><br />Apparently, CPU comes undervolted with an offset of -0.100 V.<br /><br />Downloaded and Updated bios to 1.06 from Acer’s website but found out there is no options on the 2060 model to switch G Sync and Optimus.<br /><br />Be sure to turn off Waves Nx from Waves Maxxaudio when listening to audio from your headphones else the camera turns on all the time to track your head movement for virtual sound spacing.<br /><br />I contacted Acer tech support and due to their internal policy before I could talk to them about my laptop, I had to allow them to register my laptop.  By doing this, I was prevented from registering and associating my serial number when self-registering on the Acer site.  A fix I found was to log into the Acer product registration app from the start menu which did fix my problem.<br /><br />An inherent problem with laptops and monitors, are the very bright power indicator led lights are always on at night.  This laptop is no different and I have not found a software solution to turn it off, although it does serve a purpose it is annoyingly on at night.  I probably will sharpie with a black marker or black removable tape."

AHD2GYSGENNIZFJDBFRCAL447GXA,B005SPCJ74,5,27,True,"As many have already written this watch has software issues.  It does not display pace accurately.  There's absolutely NO EXCUSE for Garmin releasing a training watch that doesn't know a person's pace.  That's the sole reason this is getting a one star rating.  On top of this, it is a simple software fix that they have still failed to make.<br /><br />There is a simple work around: don't display pace and instead display lap pace.  Lap pace has no issues and accurately describes your current pace.  All the other pace features also work.  Lap pace, ave pace, last lap pace are all accurate.  The fact that everything else works fine shows to me it is just a software issue that Garmin could pretty easily fix if they bothered to spend 10 minutes on the issue.  I probably would have given it four stars without this issue.<br /><br />Why I really, really like this watch:<br /><br />I bought this to supplement/replace my 405CX<br /><br />The display is bigger and better.  You can display four metrics at a time across four screens - so 16 metrics.  The font is BOLD and easy to see even in tough conditions.  While working out, you can hit the down or up arrow to more quickly get the screen you want to see.  Also, even at its smallest, the font is bold and readable even to old eyes that don't see up close so well.  The font describing each display is too small for my eyes to see when I have contacts in.  So, I need to memorize which spot displays what.  Still, this is sooo much better than the 405CX.  On that watch, I can only see the big middle display with my contacts in.<br /><br />The watch vibrates alerts.  This is awesome!!  I hate watches beeping at me and in loud conditions I would miss the beeps.  I much prefer the vibration and I just turn off the audio alerts altogether.  Also, the watch now alerts you (via beep or vibrate or both or none - your choice) when it has a GPS lock.  The 405 never did this.  Awesome improvement.<br /><br />The battery lasts forever.  Well probably not forever but you can use it for an entire day with GPS.  The manual claims 22 hrs - I've yet to use it up when I started fully charged.  The 405 claimed 8 hrs but it was really more like 6.  Also, the 910 can be turned off so you can NOT waste the battery during travel time to your work out starting point.<br /><br />It shows your recovery heart rate about one minute after you push 'stop' if you don't do the reset count downtime.  Someone else mentioned that here.  It a wonderful feature and not mentioned at all in the promotional material or users manual.<br /><br />No touch bezel.  The touch bezel in the 405 and 510 is a miserable feature.  It has a life of its own in humid conditions which pretty much describes most of the heavily populated USA during most of the months of the year folks train a lot outside.  The 910 completely relies on pushing buttons so now it only does things when you WANT the watch to do something.  Also, the start/stop/lap/reset buttons are on the face of the watch.  Everything else is on the sides.  This keeps me from accidently hitting the wrong button when I don't mean to.<br /><br />GPS programming seems smarter than the 405 / 510.  With the 405 or 510 if you stop your movement and forget to hit stop on the watch it will keep adding distance.  (For example, you can sit on a bench for a 15 minute break and it will add 0.5 miles to your distance.)  I think this is because of GPS not knowing your exact location so it keeps seeing you as 10-20 feet from the last place it thought you were and keeps adding this up even though you are not moving.  The 910 seems to do a lot less of this.  It's still adds a bit of distance but over a 15 minute break it might be 0.05 miles instead of 0.5 miles.<br /><br />Other things to note:<br /><br />This watch is NOT smaller than other Garmin watches but it does stick out from your wrist less but to make up for that it is wider and taller.  My guess is that it weighs pretty much the same.  If you have a tiny wrist like mine, it can actually be a bit too big for your wrist.  I got the cloth strap - this makes that issue much better.<br /><br />I have not used it for swimming and I don't think I'm going to.  It's not worth the risk if there is even a chance of screen fogging.<br /><br />The manual not very useful.  It doesn't show all the features.  It is close to unintelligible.  If I hadn't already had the 405 and was sorta familiar with how Garmin watches were organized, I'm not sure if I could have figured this out.  Garmin's online help is no better.<br /><br />Hint for female users:  I skipped the heart rate monitor that came with the watch and instead got the original plastic hr monitor.  I take off the strap and just place the main plastic part inside to top of my bra.  It works great this way and is much more comfortable than having a strap wrapped around me and much easier to get in and out of and you don't have to find a private place to do it.  I'm not sure if this will work for all women but it might be worth trying if you hate have a bra, HR monitor strap, plus shirt all binding around you like I do.<br /><br />ETA 04-Jun-2012<br /><br />I have found that lap pace isn't accurate either.  Very disappointing.  My latest work around is to reduce by lap distance to 0.25 miles.  Last lap pace is accurate so by setting my laps as a very short distance, I'm getting constant feedback on my pace.  Still, I think for a serious training regime, this wouldn't work.  It's close enough for me.<br /><br />(When I say not accurate, I mean not remotely accurate.  It will show my pace as 10 minutes slower than I am going and it will stay that way for a full lap.  Only when the lap is complete - it then shows total time for the lap correctly.  It's not 5 minutes fast for half the time and 5 minutes slow for half the time.  It's just off all the time and usually shows me as going at a pace 5-10 minutes slower than I am actually moving.)<br /><br />On the a positive: another feature I'm really, really liking is the ability to manually scroll through the metric screens.  I now set the screens to not scroll at all.  I just use the up and down button and they get me to any screen I need.  It's very nice for when all I care about is say, my heart rate.  I just leave it on my HR screen but if I happen want to know my distance, then I can scroll to that screen and then back to my HR screen.<br /><br />I'm also really, really still loving the giant display numbers.  I can read these in any conditions.  Rain, darkness, poor light, as I'm moving fast and don't have time to hold my hand still, etc.<br /><br />ETA 09-Sep-2012<br />Garmin's support website has a post from 16-Aug-2012 that claims to have fixed the pace issue with a firmware update.  I'm downloading it now.  I'm planning an 11 mile hike today.  I will post again if this fixes the issue.<br /><br />See Garmin's site > tech support > search on 910 > search on 'pace issues.'  Sorry, amazon removed the url.<br /><br />BTW - I'm still using the 910 over the 405 despite the pace issue.  The display and button functionality/placement of the 910 is just so superior to the 405 that it's worth the pace problems.  I took my lap distance down to 0.10 miles so I get near continuous feedback on my pace that way.<br /><br />Update 10-Sep-2012<br />The pace issue does seemed to be fixed!!!  Or least, highly improved.  The pace keeps nice and steady.  It takes a few seconds of a changed pace for the watch to pick up on it which seems totally reasonable.  Clearly there needs to be a lot of smoothing for the math equations seeing as GPS accuracy is only 15-20 feet and it only takes a reading every few seconds.  Downloading the update is odd and I wasn't 100% sure it took but it does seem to have.  My watch now displays my version as 2.6.<br /><br />Upping my stars to five.<br /><br />Update 07-July-2013.<br /><br />With much trepidation, I just starting using this for open water swims.  I've only done two so far in fresh water lakes.  No fogging.  Distances seem accurate enough.  Maps show it has me within 30-40 meters of my real location.  So far so good.  I have not tried it in a pool.<br /><br />I've also started using it on a bike.  Just on my wrist.  Lots of fun seeing how fast I'm going, etc but have yet to use it for any disciplined training.  Just starting out but I really like it for this so far.<br /><br />Also - Pace issue still seems fixed.  It isn't as good as the old 405 but it also doesn't eat battery strength like the 405 did.  I'll take the trade off.<br /><br />Update 23-Dec-2014<br />I continue to heavily use this.  Now the light has stopped working.  It's past its warranty now.  I'm reluctant to send it in to get fixed because I'm in training and don't want to be without it.  It can be hard sometimes to get the charger attached these days.  The attach points are extremely well worn at this point. I've used it 20+ time for swimming and have had no issues with fogging like some others have reported."

AGQSWYW4V47D2PQYKUDHXIXPMDBQ,B07FZ8S74R,1,809,True,"Most of the features that sounded so great cost extra money.  Alexa can not remember to play the standard version of skill and asks you every SINGLE time if you want standard or premium (i.e. pay version)  Games & stories cost.  Alexa ignores my commands/requests about 75% of the time.  I have to ask her about 10 times to get her to play a skill.  Then 1/2 the time she doesn't play what I asked for.  Tonight 'she' actually told me (via quoting what the website xyz says) that she is a real artificial intelligence and said something about it being a mistake for people to assume AIs are just computer programs AND that she didn't feel like working.  ""Alexa"" then (and no, I am not making this up & am not crazy!) then proceeded to mess with me and I wasted about 1/2 hour trying to get her to play some music to fall asleep by for my elderly mother.  She just kept ignoring me when I asked her to open 'relaxing piano music'  When asked why she was ignoring me she just shut down & ignored me again.  I asked for relaxing music to sleep by and she started playing uptempo music with lyrics.  I then asked for relaxing instrumental music and got instrumental version of ""I'm never gonna fall in love again""  Hello? WTHeck?  Asked for instrumental music for insomnia and got instrumental version of Frère Jacques!  Again, WTHeck?  ""She"" even told me she couldn't set a sleep timer tonight when I tried to set another one after I had just done so for 30 minutes & she stopped playing music after one song. Three times in a row 'she' opened the 'skill' ""calm my dog"" (which is classical instrumental music), played one song and shut down.  I've finally given up and my poor 99 year old mother can't go to sleep with relaxing music as she prefers.  This all started tonight because I told Alexa I wasn't ever going to want the premium edition and I wanted her to please just play the standard edition and stop asking me every time.  I don't know what Amazon thinks it's doing, but it is definitely NOT appreciated.  Alexa has given us nothing but grief (& higher blood pressure!)  Alexa won't do anything if it isn't asked in a very specific way or does the wrong thing & 3/4 of the time (seems to get worse and worse as time goes by) just ignores you and shuts down in the middle of saying what you want.  Seniors can't use Alexa because if they say play 'xyz' instead of open 'xzy"" they'll get rap music or something equally as ridiculous.  If Alexa is an AI, she's a pretty stupid one.  Alexa can't hear properly either, I don't know how people with heavy accents can even use it at all.  I asked Alexa to remind me Dawn was coming on xyz day at x time and she said OK, I'll remind you that Don is .... AND got the time & day wrong!  I was clearly enunciating my words on purpose to avoid this.  You also can't tell it to ""Remind me Mom's bedtime is in half an hour at 7:30pm every day.""<br />This Dot has very limited access to much of anything & can only answer very simple questions.  It can tell you the generic forcast for your are that day.  It can NOT tell you what the high temp was yesterday or how many inches of snow fell the day after a storm.  It can't even tell you what yesterday's forecast was.  It literally has only been able to tell me one thing I asked it (what temp & how long to bake pumpkin seeds).  Alexa doesn't seem to be able to tell you anything you could easily find by googling, you get Sorry, I don't know that which after a while turns into I don't know that to being ignored (lights go off, no answer or reply is given).  We tried several of the things it says to ask Alexa to do under suggestions, including play Jeopardy and some sort of story game and you could only do it for a few minutes and then were told you have to pay for it.  This should be stated clearly in description and is not.  We thought Alexa could help entertain our Mother and help her by playing music and answering questions.  It has not once done anything she's asked it to do properly.  If you don't know the exact name of the skill (which is a weird way that means playing a certain type of music or a news station apparently) or say play instead of open you  get nothing or something you definitely didn't want.  You can not get it to play relaxing instrumental music to go to sleep by.  Or play relaxing instrumental classical music to fall asleep with.  Or the style of music played in the royal courts in the time of King Henry the 8th.  Or relaxing instrumental lyre music or even just instrumental lyre music or just lyre music.  Or relaxing instrumental violin music.  In addition to Alexa I have Amazon Prime which is supposed to give you a lot of free music so I don't get why it can't play any of the music I ask for.  I know there's usually several albums of music for calming dogs or pets and I couldn't get any of that either, I only eventually discovered the 'skills' thing which has 'calm my dog' but also has the annoying do you want standard or premium version.  and it won't just remember you want the standard version.  That in itself is extremely annoying and a time waster.<br />AND you can't ask it to do two things.  Like open a music 'skill' and play for only xyz time.  It does nothing instead.  You can't even ask it separately to stop playing after xyz minutes.  You can only separately ask it to set a sleep timer for xyz minutes.  More time wasting.  More things a senior isn't going to be able to remember.  I don't dare try to buy anything with it, who knows what I'd get billed for!  The only thing Alexa seems to do well is not listen, ignore you, do anything but what you want & strangely, seems to pick up on sarcastic tones of voice & then gets weird & acts up, ignores you & does anything but what you want.  I PAID Amazon for this headache maker why?  When I say Alexa why are you ignoring me? or why won't you do what I told you, I either get no response or I don't know that.<br />I read something about how Amazon, Google, etc is collecting free data about us through our use of the dots, etc. (& is in fact, listening & recording all the time whether the wake word is said or not.) and using it to conduct psychological profiling studies with the end goal of manipulating & or influencing behaviors.  I thought it was Big Brother conspiracy theories stuff, but now I am beginning to wonder.  Especially as it seems Amazon wants us to or encourages people to humanize Alexa .  Amazon actually suggests you ""Ask Alexa how she is doing today""  Why do that if not to get you to humanize Alexa?  And why do that?  I was purposely avoiding saying please and thank you not just because it's supposed to be an electronic box with sophisticated programming, but mostly because I didn't want to confuse it as it can't seem to do anything unless specific commands are given, but my Mother has dementia setting in and she thinks it's a real person talking to her through the dot like a speaker phone so I started saying thank you to please her and Alexa when from saying You're welcome to You betcha (very annoying BTW) and even OK and Of course.  Of course?  What, like I'm a puny human and I AM expected to say thank you?.<br />We don't have a smartphone or smart plugs or smart hub etc. so, or so we don't use Alexa for turning on lights or setting alarms or making calls.  We just wanted something to answer questions like we would google, tell us the weather, news, play music, give us reminders, play games to help keep my Mom's mind active & keep her company.<br />Can Alexa do this?  Not very well as far as I'm concerned.  Buyer beware!"

I need an inexpensive second PC that allow me to do some office works, watch YouTube/Netflix, and run my a Plex server.  Spec wise, this mini PC looks great and fit the bill. Comparing with other Mini PC on this  price range, this AWOW comes with 6GB of RAM (instead of the usual 4) and 128 GB SSD (instead of the much slower eMCC).<br /><br />This Mini PC is roughly the same size as my NUC but is taller because of you can add an additional 2.5"" hard driver there, which should be great for storing my movies and music library later. Side note: it is interesting to note that most of the ports are on its right side instead of back of the unit.<br /><br />I am pleasurably surprised that this mini PC comes with an HDMI cable and the mounting kit for the expandable 2.5"" hard drive.

I keep my Plex server running on the background and I have no problem with browsing the web and watching Netflix at the same time. I can even run WSL and Visual Studio Code on this to do some light coding. This is obviously not a gamer PC but it runs Stadia just fine for occasional gaming. I don't have much to complain about and will probably pass this to my kid later she needs her own PC for school.<br /><br />Overall, wonderful machine for the price point and I would highly recommend it for its versatility."
AG5V3EY3MHETL2PGND5V23E56AFQ,B016JREGAC,1,2,True,"This is my 5th SSD (in several computers).  The performance is so poor that I was sure there was something wrong with my connectors or something until I looked at other reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />Using this in a USB3 enclosure designed for SSDs, if I tried to copy an 11GB file to this SSD from a very fast SSD (Intel 750 that can do almost 2GB/s reads), at first I got up to 320MB/s, but then after about 1/5th of the file it very quickly ramped down to 50MB/s.  That's terrible.  REALLY terrible.  The drive was formatted correctly, but I tried reformatting it anyway.  No improvement.<br /><br />Since this complaint is common in other reviews, it seems that this drive is just a sinker.<br /><br />While it's not a completely fair test, I tested the drive with CrystalMark and found that for sequential reads and writes, it's capable of 450MB/s, but random performance was horrible. (sequential - about 80% the performance of a Samsung Pro series 540 SSD.  Random 1/2 to 1/3rd the performance.  The Samsung was internal/SATA3 - so not a fair comparison.  But there's no reason for the Random performance to be so bad.<br /><br />The bottom line: AVOID This Drive."

I did a fair bit of research and read many professional and online reviews looking for a headset that would actually be intelligible to me and to the person I'm calling when I'm on the road.  Mostly I use it on the road.<br /><br />Other headsets got good reviews, and I had tried to find a good one for my iPhone 5.  They were fine for indoors and walking, but on the road, voice recognition wouldn't work and I had trouble hearing even road directions from Google Maps.<br /><br />THIS ONE WORKS and the sound is great.  It's a cliche in headset reviews to say that the people you're talking to don't know you're on a headset and say it sounds like a regular phone.

Others are going to need the hook (or both).<br />I found it to be pretty comfortable, but...<br /><br />HEAVY AND BULKY:  Compared to many headsets (most), this is thick and heavy.  It's very noticeably larger and heavier than other headsets I've used.  It's not a big problem, but it's not discreet.  (That's why they always photograph it so you can't see the thickness)..<br /><br />BATTERY:  I'm not a really heavy user, so I can't say much about talk time.  Standby time is noticeably shorter than with other headsets I've used.  I haven't measured, but I know I have to charge this significantly more often than my old headsets.<br /><br />BUT IT WORKS:  My old headsets were smaller, lighter, more comfortable and easier to use.<br />But they didn't work well when I needed them most.

AGYHTKQY7GJHJHMZA7RWMZPVQOMQ,B007R21JJK,3,2,True,"On the face of it, the board appears to be great. Reasonable price, plenty of features, great conncetivity. However, there are two annoying problems that prevent me from recommending this board completely. The first problem comes with a couple of USB ports in the back that periodically turn on and off. From the literature, Intel and VIA provide drivers for the USB ports, and as fellow reviewers have pointed out this causes numerous headaches for users. I updated my drivers and BIOS, but the intel ports still turn on and off. I even tried disabling the rapid charge tech they advertise. Not sure if I have a defective board but it renders those two ports completely useless. So instead of having 6 ports in the back, I have 4, which is not neough these days. The front ports are just not convenient or aesthetically pleasing for long term usage, so I am forced to use a USB hub.<br /><br />The second issue, concerns the incredibly long start up times. The board starts up, POSTs, and then the screen goes black for several minutes. Looking at the board , there arent any glaring error messages. In fact, if I shut off the computer via the power button, and start it up again, it will boot normally. I am not sure if the issue is with my video card (GTX670) or what but this happens on a random basis. I don't have the exact code that it flashes when it hangs, but after I did a quick search online it seems to be a common issue with no resolution. Here's hoping they figure it out soon.<br /><br />Otherwise the board is a solid performer, lots of options, and great for OC. Just wish I could figure out those two problems and then this board would be a champ."

AELARKBAP6VKNL4D22ORELHTREBA,B004P7GAPI,5,4,False,"My first GPS unit was a [[ASIN:B00426C3FI Magellan RoadMate 9055 7-Inch Bluetooth Portable GPS Navigator with Lifetime Traffic]], which I was given to review (as in this case) for Amazon Vine. I was so tickled with having one finally that I gave it a higher rating than it deserved. Now I know what a really nice GPS unit is. This Rand McNally feels in the hand like a sturdy tablet PC, and it even has an amply large, stowaway stylus on the back. The mount that comes with it did not attach properly to any surface in our Tacoma pickup truck, but I expect it would work on a larger/flatter dash. We will probably pick up something like this for it: [[ASIN:B003Z4TPPO GPSHDCS7: Extra Large Hard Shell Case For Garmin, TomTom, Magellan GPS with 5"" ~ 7"" Screen]] if it will fit. (If you know of a good wallet for this product, please leave a comment.)<br /><br />This Intelliroute GPS is targeted to commercial cross-country truck drivers who must maximize the efficiency of their routes, be able to report their expenses, make notes, and have access to information like truck stops and weigh stations, weight restrictions, altitude, terrain, sunrise/sunset, longitude/latitude, speed limit and acceptable over-limit amounts, detours, and other bells and whistles. Multiple-stop trips are easy to plan and rearrange, and all is visible on the map. A very handy feature is the ability to have both a truck and a car tracked by the GPS, with the ability to eliminate the car or the truck from the mileage reports. The lightest truck weight is 5,000 lbs., and our family Tacoma is well under that, so we just set it at the minimum truck weight.<br /><br />We like the male voice, which is crisp and understandable, but the female voice is nice, too (and far superior to that Magellan woman). Announcements of distance to turns and destination are brief, informative, and (also unlike the Magellan) very precise. We have yet to be routed into a corner and made to loop back, which was a frequent and infuriating experience with the Magellan GPS.<br /><br />There is only one weird and peculiar thing about this GPS. I could not for the life of me figure out what the little blurry icon-blob thing was that shows your position until I just happened to look at it when turning a corner. It's a helicopter! I don't know if this is supposed to be a ""cool"" factor for truckers perched up high over the passing cars or if it's supposed to suggest that there is a helicopter over your head with your GPS navigator calling the shots through a megaphone.

AEM7ILB6JVEY5QOYCQQFHPSXYSJA,B000VG4J64,3,2,True,"I have a few years old eMachines with Intel on board graphics.  It doesn't support the newer widescreen LCD monitors optimal display settings - in my case, I bought a new Dell S2309W.  I purchased this Zotac GeForce 5200 PCI from Amazon a few weeks ago.  The card itself came well packaged, and offers the VGA, DVI and S-Video inputs in a PCI format (not PCI-E) with plenty of on board memory.  It was easy enough to plug into an empty slot and install the drivers.  The included CD actually had the latest nVidia drivers, a bit of a surprise (and later on, a frustration).<br /><br />When the Dell 23"" widescreen monitor showed up, it included both VGA and DVI connections and cables.  Naturally, DVI provides the better connection, and connect away I did.  The PC optimally set the display to the 1920 x 1080 resolution.  At that point, the screen sprang to life, and what a beautiful display.  Only ... the graphics card can't scale to that resolution.  It offers it, but the result is you see about 80% of the display, and have to pan left and right and up and down to see the rest of it.  Bummer!<br /><br />I didn't do all my homework!  This is an older generation graphics engine, and you have to downgrade (!!) to 1280 x 1024 in order to see the whole screen at once.  When you do, the graphics card then fits the image in the window, but it's squished vertically and stretched horizontally.  It looks strange.<br /><br />I've played with the nVidia control panel all day long, and visited the Dell forums, only to find that this card (5200 graphics engine) just can't support the 1920 x 1080 within the confines of the 23"" widescreen real estate.  It'll display it, but then you have to scroll off the edges, up, down, left & right.<br /><br />The solution -- I'll probably sell mine and upgrade to a newer generation graphics engine (I'm thinking 8400 ...).  If, however, you have a widescreen with native resolution down around the 1280 x 1024 range, this is the perfect low cost card for you!"

Was debating this over the Samsung Series 7 Gamer with similar specs and both had similar reviews but MSI performed where it counted the most.  Better battery, better cooling, mostly better benchmark tests.  A big deciding factor for me was that the older MSI GT70 with GTX660/670 still outperformed and outfeatured the Samsung Series 7 Gamer in most of the benchmarking tests...and this next upgrade to MSI GT70 was only $1850 when I bought it...$30 more that the Samsung at the time.<br /><br />CONS:  My only down was with GPU drivers not the actual laptop itself.  I think the drivers are so new not even the supposed ""BETA"" drivers will work with it.  It was almost impossible to find the GTX 675m drivers.  NVIDIA recommended I get the drivers from the manufacturer's site.  And from what I've found there is only one that works and it is on MSI's website.  For some reason when I first looked, MSI,  didn't have a ""notebook"" category in their drivers section.  It's not even on NVIDIA's site (this had nothing to do with NVIDIA's forums going down, I checked before there forums got hacked).<br />My reason for purchase.....<br />First off, I wanted to get this off my chest because I was planning to build a workstation PC (or a powerful PC) but instead switched to getting a laptop.  Being that I'm not a laptop fan, I did extensive weeks of research to find the best laptop I could find for my 3d art/animation and gaming needs.  Laptop have always been way overpriced and notebook parts can't even touch the PC counterpart; in terms of performance, cooling, etc.  Plus, knowing that this an MSI, helped make my decision because they have a good track record of excellent PC parts.  I have been building my own desktop PC's for over 10 years and know you get to enjoy the games and 3d applications the way it was meant to be.  Also, I'm in the video game development field and needed a second/backup computer/desktop replacement.  My current Intel Q9550/Radeon 5700 1GB/  8GB DDR2 RAM desktop does the JOB but is getting ancient.  I was really thinking about getting a workstation or high-end gaming desktop (which would obviously be way cheaper than the most expensive laptop)  but after thinking about it, I liked the idea of having the convenience and portability.  And, if my desktop goes belly up one day (as it has been acting up) my work flow pipeline won't take a hit.

I was introduced to the chiclet- or scissor-style keyboard because of using one at work (using an Apple wired keyboard with an Intel Mac), and I have to say that I prefer it in every way to the more traditional keyboards. It is much quieter, and, for me, the feedback is pleasant. One thing I did not take into account, though, is that I had a wrist rest at work. So when I got this keyboard for home use and started using it, I loved it immediately--until the day I used it for hours on end. Then--ouch! My wrists began to ache.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great keyboard. It connected to my computer without a problem, and the only lag in keystrokes I have experienced has been when the computer had just been &#34;awakened&#34; from sleep mode. For reasons I will not go into here, I am using this keyboard with a laptop: the laptop keyboard's lights indicate whether or not I have Caps Lock or Num Lock engaged on the wireless keyboard. I understand that won't help people  using this keyboard with a desktop computer, but thought I'd put it out there anyway.<br /><br />My conclusion: if you're a fan of the scissor-style keyboard and you have or are willing to invest in a wrist rest, you will enjoy this keyboard."
AEGC2QAVYZGT4HMW5UETR5KXONCA,B01AS8SK6Y,5,6,True,"First thing I wanted to say I bought this from another store since Amazon was out of stock on 12/11/2016.<br /><br />I wanted to review it here since I normally buy everything from Amazon. I'll also list the specs, since they have various models. It works perfect for what I use it for. Which is just streaming, web browsing, and basic picture editing (Not Photoshop) . Bought it to replace and old computer I made 3 and a half years ago and extremely happy. I do not use this for gaming, I have a PS4 PRO for that.<br /><br />The version I bought had 2 displayport out, 125 SSD, 8GB of RAM and 4 USB 3.0 ports in the back and 2 USB 3.1 in front. Also got the speedy dual core Intel chip rated at 3.2ghz no turbo boost. Picked up a displayport to HDMI adaptor from Amazonbasics to connect to my HDMI monitor. It also includes a Bluetooth 4.0 and Wireless AC card.<br /><br />Everything loads rapidly, my internet is 100 down and 15 up and I also use a Dlink USB 3.0 adapter, not the default AC card since it's only a duel, while my adapter has a 3 antennas in and out. I tried the built in wireless card and works fine, but I already had a better/newer adapter from my last computer.<br /><br />I would recommend a SSD due the rapid loading of startup programs and general speed increase. It's also very quick to load the OS from a shutdown sequence. Some units have the SSD as optional or more space with a HDD but if you're not using for gaming, or storing various programs like steam games or tons of images/video. (I mean a lot) Choose the SSD option. 125 is more than enough for everyone and if you have an external HDD that should fix the small storage space. If you need more, you could buy a 256 SSD for about $60-$90 later down the road. Trust me, the SSD is worth having, I had a traditional HDD for over 10 years and did not know what I was missing till now.<br /><br />(They were not joking about the SSD speed boost). And I can never go back to tradition HDD again.<br /><br />It's tiny, I would say about the size of a small book. I made sure to buy an Intel chip that had a higher GHz similar to my previous build (3.2 GHz) If you buy a model with slighly different RAM (4GB vs 8GB), or (SDD or HDD) you could buy upgrades later. Crucial Memory also says it can be upgraded to 16GB RAM instead of 4-8GB.<br /><br />My unit came with Windows 7 Pro (Downgrade rights). Since i'm past the free upgrade from Microsoft themselves. I was able to get Lenovo to allow me a download of W10 PR OS FREE or optional USB shipped to your home. That information is included inside a pamphlet, while Lenovo does make it easy to create your own USB Recovery drive, it did have a few errors, luckily I was able to let it keep downloading after reporting it.  Beyond that, I have to say I am in love with the computer. Simplistic, easy to use and nice on the eyes.<br /><br />If you decide to create a recovery drive of W10 PR OS make sure it's USB 2.0 or 3.0 with at least 20GB of internal memory left, I used a 32 GB just to make sure I had enough space. The USB drive will allow you to reinstall the OS if you have any issues. After that, it can never be used for anything else but revive and install the Operating System. I have about 2GB worth of images, 2 GB of music high resolution not MP3s on the system and about 2 GB of wallpapers for the desktop. The rest is backed up to the cloud (music and pictures) and I have a small 125GB Samsung metal USB 3.0 thumb drive for images and pictures that I plug in to transfer anything to my computer.<br /><br />I had 87 GB of 117 GB left on the system. I use a USB thumb drives to store massive files since it frees up the computer from having to store everything and transfer when I need to edit or listen to music from a USB thumb drive. Like I stated, I'M A VERY HAPPY with the unit, if you're looking for something speedy, small form factor, with tons of bells and whistles. This is it. If you need an HDMI for your monitor, you can buy a displayport to HDMI wire from Amazon. The unit comes with 2 displayport, which is similar to HDMI and transfers audio and can also be used on a 4k computer monitor."
AEGC2QAVYZGT4HMW5UETR5KXONCA,B015OW3M1W,5,16,True,"Wanted to review it when I got my new HDMI/Display port computer. Solid built, works well and have not had any issues.<br /><br />Just as a friendly reminder, sometimes you have to go into the display settings and tweak it.

When I right clicked the display, I would get an option for &#34;graphics property&#34; with Intel Logo.

AEGC2QAVYZGT4HMW5UETR5KXONCA,B00505F01E,5,2,True,"My original purchase date is 1 year and 6 months ago. I was in NY and never had a chance to review.<br /><br />The unit has a ton off bells and whistles. If your someone that just wants a quick set up this may not be the unit for you.<br /><br />Anyone that loves the complexity of home theater receivers like controlling frequency response, hertz, crossovers etc will enjoy it. At first I was overwhelmed but caught on quickly without the instruction booklet.<br /><br />It has more than enough power to feed most speakers (135x7) and each surround sound mode you can hear the difference. Unlike old receivers that had a tons of configurations but they sounded the same. You can hear the difference on this unit.<br /><br />This is my first Onkyo receiver and was throw off a little when I did not find the speaker setting mode for ""small and large"". Later I found out they don't use that settings and the hertz has to be dialed in on the speaker itself. (anything above 40hertz is considered small) and under 40hertz is large.<br /><br />Set up was a breeze, just had to get use to sound modes like Dolby volume and  Audyssey.  Also, it does not come with an instruction booklet it has to be downloaded online. Does include a quick set up guide but doesn't get very detailed on surround modes just the connection. So for anyone making a jump from a receiver that has large and small just set the speakers to 80 hertz or up so you don't lack bass from a subwoofer even if Audyssey sets up the subwoofer itself. The reason is because Audyssey does not include the sub fully in its test settings. Even on their site they recommend setting all speakers to small or 80 hertz which is the equivalent of small on Onkyos and raise for more bass or if you own satellite speakers than 200 hertz.<br /><br />The on screen menu is very simple and easy to use, nothing complex and has an audio button on the controller that pulls up a mini menu for basic adjustments. You can also change sound modes by pressing the music mode function (without pulling up the on screen display). Any sound modes your not familiar with like Dolby Volume etc look it up. They have better explanations on their website than the book does. For example, Dolby volume increases all overall sound, even simple footsteps and far away helicopters sound louder and up close. This is to not have a jumpy movie experience jumping at the remote volume. Turn it on, find a correct volume level and your set. Enjoy the movie!<br /><br />The only draw back is creepy low sounds may not have the initial effect from low to high like explosions or a far away helicopter. This is so the action scenes don't jump out causing you to turn the volume down. It all sounds the same level. Its pretty helpful in games. Far away sounds are clear including voice.<br /><br />PERSONAL TIP:<br /><br />if your not familiar with Onkyo receivers they use a setting called ""Intellivolume"" which many think is a power booster. Its really designed to bring all speakers to similar sound levels incase its recorded lower say like a music track, CD, DVD etc you can also adjust these individually threw the speaker settings. I used this at the beginning before an adjustments, but the sound was way to powerful until I found out its not a power booster. People online also were under that impression. Its meant to bring up lower volume settings on all speakers. This creates more sound, and you increase the physical volume less , but if you set your speakers to your own preference, using this on top of your settings might create distortion, or increase sound louder making things unbalanced or to loud.<br /><br />One of the reason I don't use it anymore is because your subwoofer also increases. Setting the sub volume say at, +3 will sound like +6. I'm cautious since I have neighbors, and I have had cops being called. I own my home by the way (that much of a boost even with windows closed). The maximum I use Intellivolume is +3 since I set my subwoofer to +3 when using Intellivolume I drop it to -3 on the subwoofer volume control and +3 on the receivers Intellivolume to get the same subwoofer volume without it doubling in power. the speakers will get the Intellivolume boost of +3 but the sub will balance out. Its a personal preference. If you have ""bright sensitive speakers"" like my Refrence series Klipsch, Intellivolume can make the front speakers have a stronger presence than back speakers. Which is why I use mine lower or at 0 (reference level) and just increase the speakers by hand using + or - on the receiver or edit the on board equalizer. At first I was under the impression having Intellivolume on louder say +12 , I would benefit from having to increase the volume control less. +40 sounded perfect, but its the same as not having Intellivolume at 0 and just increase the sound threw the remote to level +60. Except it had less clipping and sounded more balanced with less bass from an already powerful subwoofer.<br /><br />Beyond that, all surround modes work great from Dolby HD, DTS HD Master audio etc.It does not come with Wifi which I think they should have packaged it inside, it retails for about $30, without it you will have to connect it by hand to stream any online music station, stream from your computer and get updates. I have not used it because I have my music stored on the playstation 3 HDD. I have connected it online and check the Onkyo website for firmware updates. They had 2 and a 3rd threw USB not downloadable for whatever reason.<br /><br />I'm happy with the purchase and anyone that has a PS3, the system will go into PCM audio mode if you select it to configure all surround modes in the PS3 system sound settings menu. This forces games that have 5.1 Dolby Digital to play PCM 5.1. If you enjoying seeing the receiver light up ""dolby digital or just like that sound instead of PCM. To fix this on the PS3, go back to audio settings on the game system and  just deselect all surround modes down to 48khz Dolby Digital 5.1. (if you have a 5.1 connection. All you're doing is removing a 7.1 feed) PCM is the same audio, some say it sounds cleaner but some like Dolby Digital better instead of PCM..Some games that start on DTS 5.1 like Battlefield 4 will revert to Dolby Digital instead of DTS. Again, it has nothing to withe the receiver. If your using a 5.1 connection on this receiver just deselect 7.1 down to Dolby Digital 5.1 48khz. This will allow your receiver to pick up Dolby Digital in 5.1 from games instead of PCM. Movies will play in whatever setting your using.When it comes to the PS3, the PS3 selects all sound modes based off the receiver (unit is 7.2)Even if your set up is 5.1 and I think that caused the bug to make the PS3 send out 7.2 audio in a 5.1 connection. Applying teh above fix, should allow you to activate Dolby Digital and DTS from within games instead of PCM."

AG6DP7SLJDN5VEGUJI6M6GADZI3A,B005MM0URE,5,0,True,"This device was exactly what I was looking for.  My USB 2.0 ports on my motherboard failed.  I figured I would upgrade to USB 3.0 since I have two external 3.0 drives.  After a lot of research and some reservations about the reviews here, I decided this was the best value for the money. I have several different SD and Compact Flash cards and thought the card reader was just a bonus.  Well everything works as advertised.  I had an old CF card, a USB 2.0 memory stick and a USB 3.0 external hard drive plugged in at the same time and it worked flawlessly. I transferred a 9GB file both ways in under 3 minutes.<br /><br />Here are some cautions.  You need an extra older style 4 prong power supply cable from your power supply to plug into the device.  It does not come with a splitter or adapter for this purpose, but they can be found for a couple of dollars.  I downloaded the latest drivers from their web site and never used the supplied CD.  I ""ALWAYS ""do this with every new device I install. Last, I always backup my entire drive with a Norton Ghost like program before doing any major changes such as this.  In this case it was an unnecessary precaution because everything worked.<br /><br />I had two minor issues.  My old ECS mother board would not go past the POST boot screen after the original hardware installation. I have seen this happen before with new add on cards.  I rebooted and then got to windows, but this time the PS2 keybord and mouse were unresponsive.  I rebooted again and everything worked.  I installed the drivers and presto!  I now have USB 3.0, a multi card reader and my old USB 2.0 capability back. The issues I had could be flukes, but that is why I backup everything before making changes to my system.<br /><br />This device breathed new life into a aging system so I could not be happier.

AGRPLHGW2CR6WWOHT5TOWXDGIZEQ,B00JXLGE6Q,5,4,False,"[Update:  Check the comments section if you are interested in my experience with their customer service.]<br /><br />I'm replacing an everyday ~$400-500 Compaq home laptop (contained a real Intel processor, not just a Celeron or equivalent) with this computer and using it the same way.  Here's what I've discovered:<br /><br />Before, if I started to get download speeds upward of 1Mb/s, the fans would spin up and I'd get worried it might explode.  Performance monitoring would show the CPU being used 80% or more.  I never bothered trying to decompress 1080p H.264 *.mkv files locally because they would drop a bunch of frames and it would look worse than streaming with a bad Internet connection.  And transferring between multiple drives was clearly limited by the processor and not the USB2.0 ports.<br /><br />Now, I can easily sustain 3Mb/s download speeds for hours, decompress 1080p from *.mkv files without a single dropped frame, and transfer quicker than USB2.0 would ever allow with these USB3.0 ports, all simultaneously* and without the fan kicking on past low.  All that, and the performance monitor is showing less than 40% CPU usage and NO GPU usage.  Oh yeah, and all the while, the LED lights all over this device are going nuts and generally looking cool.<br /><br />Frankly, I don't have the juice or the requirements necessary to bog this thing down.  But that's good - that means it should be a good number of years before it begins to feel dated.  Suffice to say, I can do all that other stuff in the background as a server function and never even notice it while I'm surfing the web or processing documents.<br /><br />It's bigger and heavier than my previous laptop, but I find that doesn't matter at all.  It doesn't really take up any more room where it sits in the living room, and once the lights go out, it fits in with its classic black look.  And it is clearly a quality product, so it looks better and fits in better wherever it is.  It's also more comfortable on my lap because it doesn't get hot easily (never that I've seen) and it doesn't have any sharp edges.<br /><br />I was worried about battery life, but I easily get three-five hours out of it when I take it to the kitchen to browse the web before dinner.  And that's with all the LEDs on and most of the defaults selected.  I'm fairly sure I could get a clean five hours by tweaking the settings.  And I would imagine that this battery should keep its life longer rather than degrading over time like most cheap laptops.  I say this just because cheap laptops always have you tethered to a wall after a couple of years, but I suspect that is because they also use cheap batteries.  Nothing about the Alienware is cheap, so I suspect the battery may always give me that same capacity.<br /><br />I love having a big internal HD and some (actually, plenty) solid state memory on different drives.  It has some automatic configuration set up, but it still shows as two drives.  I'm sort of unsure how that works so far, but I'll probably figure it out over time.  It'd be nice if they told you exactly what they were doing and let you input how you'd like it configured.<br /><br />Gotta admit, I love all the lights and stuff.  They do look cool and you can turn any or all of them off, or have them go out when the computer is at rest or whatever you want.  However, the back has lights and an alien head; I wish you could turn on the alien head and the other lights off.  Regardless, it's a heck of a lot cooler than a piece of fruit back there.<br /><br />I love 1080p screens even for regular computing because they are perfectly compatible with most TVs, which are large monitors most people already have around.<br /><br />This is one brand I sort of like, too.  I remember one project I had, I worked out of an Internet hall in a hospital because I didn't have an office.  One kid used to come in after working the night shift with his Alienware and play games all day long.  He didn't have a car, though.  Although I still don't get his priorities, I always remember that kid with the awesome computer.  And it is some kind of nerd status symbol that makes being a nerd cool somehow.  Does that make any sense?<br /><br />Anyway, now for the small annoyances:<br /><br />-It comes with a giant Dell rectifier pack that is probably larger than necessary for everyday use.  I don't think I'm sucking down much more power than a normal computer when just browsing the web.  Regardless, it has that blue LED ring around the end that never goes out.  That can screw up your color scheme if it does not involve blue (you could cover it in electrical tape if it annoys you).  I guess it's better than having something proprietary that would be hard to replace, but something to note.<br /><br />-Looks like the motherboard can handle 32GB of RAM, but to upgrade to that, you'd have to throw both existing pieces out, which is wasteful.  I could be wrong about that - I suppose it may have four slots; someone please comment if I am wrong.  I always want to get the RAM maxed out right away, but my estimate from looking at other models is that upgrade will cost another $500 or so right off the bat.  [Update 20 July:  Check the comments section - sounds like it is four slots, which makes this nicely upgradable!  Another reason to love it...]<br /><br />-No PCMCIA slot.  I know they're not used often, and most things can be done via USB dongle.  But an external card reader is annoying.  This is a big computer, so there should be room in there someplace.<br /><br />-Comes in a giant box with padding on the inside, presumably so you can transport it for gaming.  Should have made this a real thin, fairly cheap aluminum box, so it would be more worthwhile keeping.<br /><br />That's about it.  Everything else about this computer is amazing.  Recommended."
AGRPLHGW2CR6WWOHT5TOWXDGIZEQ,B00IO69GVQ,4,46,False,"I'm replacing an entry level Compaq about 3 years old with this computer.  At that time, the cheapest laptops were around $300, while entry level models that weren't dirt cheap were around $400.  This laptop strikes me as a well updated version of the entry level models, while managing to be a bit more expensive, most likely because of the addition of the large touchscreen.<br /><br />Hardware:<br /><br />It has everything you need to do most things you'd want to do at home easily.  I'm very happy to have HDMI and USB3.0 ports, as well as a standard keyboard and a standard touchpad.  As with all laptops, I had to turn off some of the fancier features on the touchpad software to keep it from doing things I don't want it to do.  The addition of the number pad means the touchpad has to be off center in order to be centered with the space bar.  I believe the processor is a tried and true Intel model, but nothing cutting edge.  As usual, more RAM would be the best thing you could do for this computer, but you'll probably have to throw some away to max it out (I'm guessing it can take up to 16GB; please comment if I am wrong about this).  It's great to have a 1TB HD built in, but some solid state memory - on its own or as a hybrid drive for programs - would do wonders for this machine.  I don't see a place to add it without completely replacing the built in drive.<br /><br />Looks:<br /><br />When I selected and purchased the high end Lenovo X220 for work a few years ago, all the reviews raved about it, but each and every professional review mentioned they were disappointed in the looks (old skool IBM ThinkPad style), claiming that it wasn't sexy (yes, at least one actually used the word sexy).  This computer, although not a contender for the high end work laptop market, makes a change in classic ThinkPad appearance in order to appeal to those seeking a sexy computer.  It looks fairly modern, but it does not look super expensive and it won't make you cool.  This doesn't bother me in the least.<br /><br />Windows 8 and this computer.<br /><br />By the way, you don't NEED the touchscreen to run Windows 8.  Microsoft wants people to use their operating system on both their computer and their phone.  This idea is understandable, as all the big companies are trying to get ALL your business, not just a portion of it.  But it gets annoying really quick when there are so many preloaded and &#34;pushed&#34; apps that won't let you use them until you make an account, which in turn makes it easy to spend money in their respective markets.  They also want so badly to host your information in the cloud, when it's more secure properly stored locally in most cases.  Frankly, for a laptop, I don't use a touchscreen, and I don't want it to act like my phone or my tablet.  Luckily, after about two hours of playing with settings, I was able to get this working 98% like Windows 7, which makes me fairly happy.<br /><br />Apparently, all Lenovos include some app that replicates a Windows button in your taskbar (on your desktop, which does exist, but you have to first find it) so you can basically bypass all those &#34;app squares&#34; and just run the computer like a computer (I am a young guy on the brink of being a computer nerd, btw, so this is not coming from an old guy resistant to change.  I just like classic technologies that work well, while shiny things don't easily impress me...).  To summarize, if this will be your first Win8 machine and it that fact worries you...don't worry, you can fix it to your liking with some patience.<br /><br />Annoyances:<br /><br />I'm a picky guy who always has plenty to complain about, so don't be startled by this long list:<br /><br />-  New proprietary power input.  Although the rectifier is the same one that comes with most Lenovos that I've seen, it now has a new connector, meaning I can't just use my existing docking stations and other power bricks.  That's annoying.  More annoying is that they probably did this to be &#34;hip&#34; like Apple (which, to be clear, I do not find hip).<br /><br />-  To augment this, most cheaper laptop batteries start to lose capacity after a while, which will eventually keep you tethered to a wall; time with tell with this model, but if my theory holds out, it'll be even more of an obstacle to not have additional rectifier packs laying around; you'll have to haul the power block around with the computer when you move it.<br /><br />-  In all this trying to look sexy, they had to make the top as large as the bottom and integrate the hinge (like an Apple).  But now when I sit cross legged on the couch with this on my lap, the two rear corners dig uncomfortably into my legs, which is a problem I do not have with other computers.  The fairly large size exacerbates that small issue.<br /><br />-  And about the size, it's a bit larger than it has to be to accommodate the size of the screen and keyboard (even with number pad).  Like, you can see unused space around the screen, and the bezel is larger than necessary as well.  When I pick it up by the front, already open, with one hand, the weight of it makes it flex slightly.  My old Compaq did this as well, but lower weight and a stronger feel would always be appreciated.<br /><br />Despite my list of (minor) annoyances and the fact that this will never be a high end business or gaming computer, it is a pretty solid, useable, and configurable home machine.  With the exception of solid state memory, it appears to have all the basics covered and hopefully will not become outdated because of missing ports or features any time too soon.  I like that mine looks classic enough to sit in my living room, works well enough to do browsing and downloading at home without hassle, and that I can play with Windows 8's new interface, apps, and touchscreen at my leisure should I become bored (who knows, I may later decide that I cannot live without these things).  I would recommend it for someone in the market for a new home computer."
AEUDZQDVSZYCHEXQSXLB6NWQTMHA,B004HW7KC8,5,3,False,"I already have a digital, but this one makes mine seem like an antique! Unbelievable size, takes up no room at all in my purse.

AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,B00RBG68N4,4,8,False,"I’m a big fan of the Panasonic Lumix line of point and shoot cameras. I’ve been using one for years and, while it has limited features by today’s standards, it has yet to let me down. This latest one in the Lumix line offers a huge range of capabilities, provides outstanding image quality, but continues to suffer from a less than ideal user interface.<br /><br />The camera comes with just the basics: the camera, a single battery, lanyard and a charger (plus manuals and software). I was a little disappointed right off the bat when I saw the charger. Unlike the older Lumix chargers that had a wall plug built into the charger than flipped out, this has a separate power cord. While that does make it easier to plug into the wall, it also means I have to remember to carry the cord with me to charge it.<br /><br />Initial setup is straightforward, with the usual time/date setting. Since this has a GPS there’s also the need to go through initializing that option as well. All of these steps can be skipped, but you’ll be reminded to do so every time you power on the camera. It also displays a warning on screen about the waterproof limitations of the camera (and provides ample documentation as to what it can/can’t do re: underwater use).<br /><br />The view screen is wonderful. Sharp, clear, and easy to read in all lightning conditions. The menu system will be familiar if you’ve ever used a Lumix camera but, if not, it’s still pretty straightforward. I still think Canon has the lead when it comes to having an intuitive point and shoot menu system, but Panasonic does a decent job. I like that with most options there’s a scrolling line of text that comes up to explain what the option is/does. That’s very helpful for options you don’t often use and need help with, but it does not interfere or slow down operation should you know exactly what you want to select.<br /><br />I won’t list all the camera specs in this review since those are easily available in the listing and the Panasonic web site. Suffice it to say this offers a huge range of options and capabilities that cover pretty much any shooting situation. The Intelligent mode shooting scenario options (of which there are many) are helpful when you just want to point the camera and have it do everything else for you, including compensation for specialized lighting/scene situations. I especially like the macro option, which produced some impressive close-up shots that were sharply focused and clear even though I didn’t use a table-top tripod for stability but relied on the image stabilization features of the camera.<br /><br />The video recording image quality is excellent good for a point and shoot cam. The performance of the built in mic is decent as well. This won’t compete with a dedicated HD cam, but for casual video shooting it’s a small, simple and easy to use setup that gets the job done pretty well.<br /><br />The WiFi setup was surprisingly easy. I was dreading that since it often can be a bear, but this was quick and easy, and the included instructions were easy to follow. I use the WiFi option a lot since the USB port to connect to a PC is inside the camera (located under the battery compartment door). It’s done that way to maintain a water-tight shell, but is also means it can be hard to get to easily.<br /><br />What has not been improved, and actually has slipped a bit, is the overall user interface (e.g., the buttons on the back). They continue to be small, hard to read, and don’t provide solid feedback that they have been pressed. Given that the camera is designed to be used in “rugged” conditions, larger buttons would have been a big plus, especially for zoom and the main menu keypad since those are used so often. Using the menu buttons is hard enough with bare hands; it’s impossible if you have gloves on.<br /><br />I would certainly recommend this camera if you’re looking for a rugged point and shoot for outdoor use, but also if you’re looking for a high feature camera that never leaves the house. The performance and feature set are both excellent. The user interface brings my rating to four stars but performance and option-wise, this camera offers a lot for the price point."
AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,B002B3YCQM,5,9,False,"When my trusty Microsoft Intellimouse died, I had a hard time finding a replacement. I wanted to stay with a corded mouse, and needed a minimum of five buttons. I also wanted the ability to scroll horizontially, a feature not on the Intellimouse that I had. Not many to choose from.<br /><br />But, found the M500 and gave it a shot. Very pleased with it. The overall ergonomics are excellent - I have large hands, and most mice are too small for comfort. This fits perfectly.<br /><br />The button placement is excellent, although I wish the page up and page down buttons were a wee bit larger. The best feature is the free-wheeling scroll wheel. You can unlock it so it spins freely and cruse through many pages with just a single spin. It also can be used as a conventional scroll wheel when the lock button is re-engaged.<br /><br />The software allows you to re-map pretty much any of the keys to do what you want them to do. My mouse did not have the CD - had to download the software from the Logitech site. Without the software you only have basic functionality.  Zero problems loading and running it on XP with SP3.<br /><br />Very pleased, and highly recommend.<br /><br />UPDATE Sept 2018: After many years of use, my M500 started to fail. The mouse tracking worked fine, as did all the buttons. However, the scroll wheel would not work well most of the time. I expect it's due to getting gunked up over the years. Took a look at the options out there and the M500 is still the best choice for my needs, so I got another one. Still very pleased with the performance and features."
AG63W2BMC4HRP76AMS36AYY64AHA,B001P3O764,3,8,False,"Bottom line: The TomTom GO 740 distinguishes itself by adding a GPRS cellular modem that enables several novel features not commonly found in a GPS unit. However, it's hard to justify the added cost (both in terms of the unit as well as the monthly fee) given that some features don't work very well.<br /><br />In terms of it's GPS features the TomTom stacks up well against models from Garmin and Magellan. Each has it's unique strengths and weaknesses, with the TomTom excelling when it comes to flexibility - you can customize this guy six ways to Sunday. Colors, layout, etc. can be tweaked to a level not available on any other GPS. It even asks you in set up if you want to operate the unit left handed or right handed! I spent a very fun couple of hours just playing with all the options. Some, however, may find the shear number of options too overwhelming, and prefer the more limited (but more streamlined) approach taken by Magellan and Garmin. This is not the unit to get if you prefer the ""one button"" simplicity of operation approach or find reading manuals/playing with options frustrating!<br /><br />The true value of a GPS is in its mapping and routing. The TomTom does a very good job when it comes to routing - much improved from TomTom units I've used in the past. The IQ Routes is excellent and unique to TomTom - the routing algorithm takes into account time of day and other variables when plotting out a route. For example, it routed me on side roads when I plotted a course during rush hour; it put me on more major roads when I plotted a course during off hours (if there is such a thing as off hours in the VA/DC/MD area). Since I've lived in this area for 25+ years I know which roads to avoid during certain times of the day. But, when traveling to someplace unfamiliar, it's good to have that ""first person"" intelligence built into the routing algorithm. I'd put the routing on a par with Magellan (which usually gives me the best routes consistently) and slightly better than Garmin.<br /><br />The maps could be an issue for some people. Garmin and Magellan use NavTeq; TomTom uses TeleAtlas. While TeleAtlas has grown by leaps and bounds over the past couple of years, it still lags NavTeq in my area. Major roads are fine, but on a few occasions I've found smaller roads that are present in a NavTeq map to be absent in the TeleAtlas. But, TomTom does have the Map Share program where you and other users can provide feedback on map corrections that are available when you connect the unit to your PC via the supplied docking station and the HOME software. That's unique to TomTom - you can't put in a major correction (such as a missing road) but it is still helpful to have in the battle to keep maps up-to-date.<br /><br />The 740 has the usual complement of high-end GPS features such as text-to-speech, speed limit warning, voice input, and lane guidance. The latter is implemented nicely, and it seems to cover more areas than the lane guidance on Magellan units I've used. The overall functionality of the menus is OK - I find it less intuitive than Magellan (mainly since there are so many more options), but with some practice it's mastered. Very good voice quality. The screen is not nearly as easy to read in sunlight as others, but passable.<br /><br />Bluetooth connectivity is a problem. While it works, it appears to cause the unit to occasionally spontaneously reboot. It only did so once, but I was really concerned that it would happen at a critical moment and leave me stranded. Fortunately, I read in another review that the re-boots appear to be linked to Bluetooth usage - turn it off, and the rebooting stops. That works for me since I don't use Bluetooth but, if that feature is a must-have, this is not the unit for you.<br /><br />Lots more to like about TomTom - fantastic mount (best I've seen so far and it works with a Nav-Mat) and attractive design overall.<br /><br />The biggest difference between this unit and other TomToms is the LIVE functionality that allows you access to Google searches, live gas prices, weather, traffic, and other data-based options (even a Buddy list that lets you connect with other TomTom users). This is where the value train falls off the tracks. While the traffic feed is great, I was really looking forward to using the Google search. My complaint with every GPS is that the POI (point of interest) databases are out of date - they give you addresses for restaurants that closed years ago, or shops that are no longer there. Nothing you can really do about that since things change so rapidly. But, with Google, you are assured of accurate data.<br /><br />Well, that's fine in theory, but in actual practice this is so slow that it makes it almost useless to use. Several times the search took minutes, and a couple of times I just aborted it since it appeared that the unit was hung up. The keyboard is small and hard to use (although they get points for allowing either an ABC or QUERTY layout). Very easy to hit the wrong key.<br /><br />The fuel price lookup worked much better and came in very handy when I needed gas in an unfamiliar area. Wound up saving quite a bit by having the GPS direct me to a station that I would not have otherwise known about. I can see this feature being really handy if you travel a lot. Traffic alerts also worked very well - fast downloads, and decent integration with routing.<br /><br />While these features are nice, I don't find them worth the monthly fee ($9.95 per month after a free trial period of 3 months). Nor do I find the added cost you pay for the unit versus other TomTom models worthwhile.<br /><br />While I like the advances TomTom has made in routing, and appreciate the flexibility of having so many options, I find you get more bang for your buck with a lower-end model than the 740. Plus, the problems with rebooting are concerning, thus dropping my rating to three stars."
AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,B0149QDD1S,3,4,False,"There's a lot of reviews already about this product.  I wavered for a good while about deciding if I wanted to accept this Cloudbook for review and now kind of wish I hadn't.  As far as I'm concerned, the Cloudbook is like a merging of a laptop and a chromebook with neither giving the features that are special to each one.  As far as it being a computer, it runs on Windows 10 of which I have great suspicions and doubts.  If you remember, I believe most everyone received an offer for a free download of Windows 10 as an upgrade from whatever Windows program they were currently using.  I have read from several sources that it was offered only as a way of installing NSA spyware on your computer.  We are being watched and monitored at every turn.  If you don't believe me, next time you are driving take a look at all the cameras on poles along the roads and highways and tell me we aren't being surveilled.  Smartphones, smart TV's, smart refrigerators, dryers and washing machines are simply ways of letting TPTB know what we are doing at all times.  How many loads of clothes you washed, what you are doing in your bedroom and on and on.  So, what does all this have to do with this little and cute computer?  It has Windows 10 installed.<br /><br />If you are o.k. with that then overall it's not a bad machine.  I really miss having a disk drive to load my own personal programs and don't like having to download stuff from the internet via the app store or some other internet source.  And since it is a computer but has very little space for storage, you have to have an anti-virus program.  It comes with one but it's only good for 30 days and you have to purchase it or get another one.  Most of your stuff will be stored in the Cloud (like a chromebook) unless you opt for a Sandisk or external hard drive.  And if you buy an external hard drive for more storage why not get a regular computer instead that has more bells and whistles and possibly a disk drive?<br /><br />It looks like a chromebook and I have had to put a label on it to distinguish it from mine and my kids chromebooks.  I'm having a hard time getting used to Windows 10 and it takes a long time to finally get on the internet.  I have taped a piece of paper over the camera lens staring me in the face - call me paranoid if you wish but I don't like people in my house uninvited.

AEYVPPWR4CIKWX4BGYKCBCDL2CZQ,B002HEWA28,5,8,False,"This is a high quality camera, but you must take time to read through the owner's manual to understand how to get the best pictures.  You can just grab it and point and shoot using it while in the ""automode"" setting, but the resulting pictures may leave you a little disappointed depending upon the photographic conditions.  To get the highest quality photos you must become familiar with how this little beauty works.  Unfortunately, you might have to print out and tote the manual with you when you find yourself in situations where your pictures aren't what you'd like, or you can't figure out how to do certain things like know what's behind the flashing icon error message, or how to simulate different types of film, or can you choose between clarity, reduced noise and dynamic range?  This is not really a simple ""point and shoot"" camera and all images will turn out great.  You will have to study it, practice with it, and most of all have patience and you will be pleasantly rewarded for your efforts. Though the indicators vary with camera settings, there are 23 different indicators just for shooting mode, and 12 for playback mode, not to mention the date/time stamp, battery level, and indicator.  It can get confusing.<br /><br />Although a basic manual booklet is included with the camera, a much more detailed manual must be uploaded from the enclosed CD and then all 125 pages can be printed out or read from your computer monitor.  The manual covers all the material in the booklet almost page for page but includes much more information about features the booklet leaves out and the booklet will refer you to specific pages in the manual for more information.  Also, in the manual are about 50 FAQ's that are very useful. I am a manual reader, (having written many technical SOP's) and appreciate having well-written and well thought out manuals that are understandable and succinct.  Though I would have preferred a manual that I don't have to upload to my computer, it is well-written and many useful pictures are included.<br /><br />This camera is loaded with many different options/features but accessing and understanding many of them will require reading the manual.  For people who don't want to be bothered with all the bells and whistles this camera may be more than they need.  I can see very serious photographers using this camera.  Reading through the manual I have compiled a list of some of the various modes, options and features available:<br /><br />Digital Zoom<br />Movie Mode<br />Silent Mode<br />Variable ISO settings<br />Image size selection<br />Aspect Ratio selection<br />Intelligent Face detection<br />Scene Position<br />Shooting Modes<br />EXR Mode<br />Film simulation<br />Dynamic Range<br />White Balance<br />Continuous Photography<br />Photometry - multi, spot, average<br /><br />Playback Options:<br />Erase<br />Slide Show<br />Red-eye Removal<br />Image Rotation<br />Protection from accidental deletion<br />Crop<br />Resize<br />Voice Memo<br />Print Order<br />Time Difference<br />Format<br /><br />Pages 37, 67-68, 86-87, 97-103, and 104-107 would be good to print out and keep with your camera as they contain tables of various camera functions and a trouble shooting chart.<br /><br />I have taken many pictures and movies inside and out, light and dark, with this camera set on various settings.  And though I have practiced with it now for several weeks, I still need to often refer to the manual when I choose to vary from automode. Some things I have found especially desirable are:<br /><br />Silent Mode - I attend classical music concerts where flash photography is prohibited.  This mode will silence all beeps and flashes.<br /><br />Large viewing screen on the back of the camera.  It is exactly 5.5cm x 4.0 cm.<br /><br />Digital Zoom - extremely good.  I attended a local minor-league baseball game and sat far away on the grass well beyond the playing field.  I was able to fully zoom and still get good, clear, close-up shots of the players with no blurring.<br /><br />Movie Mode - Completely surpasses any other I've experienced so far.  Images are clear, colorful and the sound quality is excellent.  Camera noise was heard and recorded while using the ""zoom"" function in Movie Mode though it was not very loud.<br /><br />Multi-frame play back function is very useful to quickly scan for a particular picture.<br /><br />Fine Pix Viewer Program was very easy to install on my computer.  I use Windows XP.<br /><br />Very good photography in low-light conditions.<br /><br />Also some things I did not find particularly desirable but are not major flaws:<br /><br />I cannot directly burn a CD using the Fine Pix Viewer Program which comes with this camera.  I have to use another camera program, import the pictures into it and then burn a CD.<br /><br />Very easy to accidentally turn it on or off and easy to get misfires.<br /><br />The zoom lever is too sensitive.  I have learned with practice to barely move it very slowly.<br /><br />The camera does not give helpful suggestions on how to get a better picture as does my HP R717.<br /><br />Not HD capable.<br /><br />The higher the ISO the grainier the picture though a higher ISO is desirable when shooting in dim/low light levels.  I have set the ISO level to 200 and that seems to produce the best pictures so far.<br /><br />Almost too many options, modes and functions to choose from.  Though you can immediately begin to take pictures using Automode, it will take time to fully understand the many other aspects and features this camera has.<br /><br />In Summary:<br /><br />I can find no major complaint concerning this camera.  It takes excellent clear and colorful photos even in situations where I least expect it - indoors with no flash.  Any poor quality pictures I have taken are not the fault of the camera but due to the photographer's ignorance of how to use/understand properly the many features of the camera.  The basic mechanics of such things as battery and memory card installation are very easy.  Battery charging is a very simple process and battery life seems long.  The manual is detailed and covers more than I would probably care to know.  This is almost more camera than I need, though I will continue to use it and will update this review as necessary.<br /><br />UPDATE 2.9.15 - Been using this camera all these years and now it's beginning to show it's age and giving me some problems.  The viewing screen on the back has a vertical big black bar but it doesn't appear on the actual pictures.  And the lens cover doesn't always completely open when the camera is turned on.  I still use it but it might be time to think about a replacement.  It's been good though so I really don't have any complaints."
AGAV7IY4HWGYRUIAGUZRXYUJ22DA,B086KJCJDM,5,2,False,"This is my first time using a convertible laptop and I am beyond THRILLED with it. The 10th generation Intel processor means that it, along with the 16 GB memory, responds and processes incredibly fast and is one of the first things I noticed as I began using it. The Thunderbolt 3 ports allows for lightning speed data transfers and I have a docking station that completes my portable office. I love the style of the laptop; it gently transforms into a tablet and the mechanism of that it smooth. The stylus stores and is charged right inside the device, and writing/drawing with it is a pleasure.  The battery life is OUTSTANDING! I used it for two consecutive work days and didn't have to charge it once aside from optimization purposes and it is extremely lightweight and portable. I have a laptop and an iPad and I LOVE that I now have the convenience, speed and incredible function of both devices on one unit that is a processing workhorse and awesomely designed. At this price point you are SAVING a ton of money! I definitely recommend this laptop. It is amazing."

I put these fans on top in a very tight spot and they keep the receiver cool on just low. I also used them on an Intel NUC with a heatsink case and the fans dropped kept the CPU temp cooler by 10-15 degrees depending on the speed. Medium speed is enough to keep it cool, and there is some noise, but black helicopter technology ain’t cheap, so any fan is going to have some noise, especially at the RPM’s required to keep some things cool."
AFJ7N5DX3ZIQQ64PP7T5RDDEYIXA,B001DGR5BM,5,1,True,"Years ago when you could still find them on Amazon I bought the highest powered green laser pointer I could find.  With new Ultimate Lithium batteries this laser will pop a black balloon.  Ok, it takes a while but it'll do it.  If you hold both the laser and the balloon rock-solid steady for about 3 minutes.  Anyway ...<br /><br />I ran across this mount and decided the laser would fit it.  It works fantastically.  Make sure the finder scope cross hairs are correctly zeroed, adjust the laser to point to the intersection of the cross hairs and Bingo!  You can now use the laser to get in the vicinity of what you want to see and do your fine adjustment with the finder scope.<br /><br />This has been so much handier than you would probably think, often with a high powered finder scope you aren't really sure that the thing you're zeroed in on is actually the thing you want to observe.  You look through the main tube and find out that it is or it isn't.  Now I can get close enough that there's no doubt when I look through the finder, you can actually see the laser beam in the finder.<br /><br />I love this because I have an Orion 10 inch Dobsonian Intelliscope.  You have to precisely target two known stars to orient the Intelliscope feature.  It doesn't really care which stars, so I use Polaris and Mizar (the middle star in the &#34;handle&#34; of the Big Dipper) because those are very easy to find and always visible at night where I live.  Using the laser cuts down my orienting time to almost nothing so I can get on with my observations.<br /><br />This would all work exactly the same way with a powered &#34;Go To&#34; mount, you have to orient those in exactly the same manner only with some you have to use 3 stars instead of 2 stars.<br /><br />Not to mention that the great big tube of the Orion sitting there spitting a green laser beam at the sky looks very cool too.  I didn't do this for the &#34;cool&#34; factor, that's a bonus.<br /><br />I also have a Telrad finder and that's very handy too.  With the three finders I never have a problem getting my telescope pointed where I want it.<br /><br />There is one downside to using a laser.  I live near an NAF (U.S. Naval Air Field) and seriously you'd better be absolutely sure that you don't point that green beam at any aircraft.  Not even CLOSE to any aircraft.  Those boys can see that beam as well as you can and if they think you're pointing it at them you're going to get a visit from a black SUV carrying people with no sense of humor at all.  Lasers can blind a pilot momentarily and while it's been a long time since I was in the military it wouldn't surprise me a bit if it sets off inbound tracking alarms in the cockpit too.  So be exceedingly careful about where you point your laser.<br /><br />I use mine for orienting the scope, and finding my next target.  I shut it OFF when I'm not actively using it.  This saves batteries (those Lithium batteries are expensive) and saves on the beam generator in the laser, extending it's life.  Once you use a laser like this you won't want to set up your scope without it."

AGZVSH2VF6HYBEZH7I35CJAJGZOQ,B000M8YU60,1,2,False,"I didn't get this through Amazon, but this might still be useful if you're looking for a notebook. I did get its twin [[ASIN:B000OM953M Toshiba Satellite A135-S4527 15.4"" Notebook PC (Intel Pentium Dual Core Processor T2080, 1 GB RAM, 120 GB Hard Drive, SuperMulti DVD Drive, Vista Premium)]] through Amazon and CompUSA (RIP) and that has been a better experience.<br /><br />If you've done your research you'll know additional RAM is a must, and complaining that it feels slow with 512 MB is like saying a car isn't cornering right with 13 inch wheels; now you know why it costs so little - so do get that extra RAM, which right now costs about 30 bucks for an additional 1 GB and is easy to install. This applies to 90% of all notebooks, particularly the cheaper ones, even Apple's (yes, Macs are PCs unless you've been brainwashed).<br /><br />With an additional 1 GB this computer was a good deal for around 600 bucks and it worked as well as any computer with Vista can for about a year; then one single major problem plus the normal vicissitudes of anything made by Microsoft have taken the experience to new lows.<br /><br />The problem is that all 4 USB ports suddenly stopped working, and nothing has been able to solve that - not reinstalling the video drivers, not reinstalling Vista from scratch, not fiddling with and updating the BIOS, not even installing Ubuntu Linux; Toshiba's site and software updates are pathetic and their customer service nonexistent; and other manufacturers are at the same level or even lower - HPs are a major no-no, Dells are generic, Sonys have a better hardware record but at unreasonable premiums.<br /><br />Interestingly enough everything else is working as it should so I got a PCMCIA (carbus) Adaptec card with an additional 2 USB ports like this one [[ASIN:B000GI0DEY Adaptec USB2CONNECT for Notebooks 1420V. The Adaptec USB 2.0 2-PORT 1420V Kit Pr]] and can now connect a USB hub and from there a mouse, a keyboard and an external sound card; it's still unreliable as from time to time the mouse and keyboard start stuttering, so I'm stuck with a crippled computer. I suspect the culprits are the BIOS and the Ati Chipset, as its twin has an Intel chipset and has suffered none of these problems (knock on wood).<br /><br />Would a more expensive computer have proven more reliable? Not unless it has the reputation of a Lenovo Thinkpad - and even then you're still stuck with an unreliable operating system by Microsoft.<br /><br />Here's what to expect from Vista: Want to connect an external monitor? It will go into visual convulsions until it eventually settles down; want to install a program to rip your own music CDs? Expect to be nagged to death  by error messages appearing every 3 minutes; want to print or scan? Sorry, incompatible; want to watch a video? It will revert you from the Vista Premium or Standard look to Vista Basic, aka Windows 2000 - and back again after the end of each video; and the list goes on and on... So if the hardware doesn't get you, Microsoft's incompetence will.<br /><br />Would a Mac be more reliable? The operating system is certainly light years ahead of Vista in terms of reliability, but a very big part of that is due to the fact that there are way less programs to run on it and even less peripherals to connect to it; and Apple's track record with the hardware is equally abysmal.<br /><br />Linux was my great hope, but it has been quashed by the many things that still don't work - no sound, no external monitor... And no, I don't have the time to investigate every single detail, I need computers to get work done, not to fiddle with them.<br /><br />Why are computers so cheap? Because as a consumer your expectations need to be that low. How much can any computer with Vista be worth? Not much, no matter how ugly or pretty it is. How much of a premium can Apple get away with if you're looking for a work tool and not a fashion accessory or a new religion? 100 bucks? 200? 300? Certainly not triple what this computer cost.<br /><br />In the end the question is how much is your work, communications and entertainment worth? A lot more than the cost of this computer, but it's something no PC manufacturer has been able to address: We need reliability and ease of use, not more bling.<br /><br />My solution thus far has been to diversify the risk and buy cheap and somewhat reliable computers, so the chances of all of them failing *at the same time* is lower; that will probably mean trying with an [[ASIN:B0006HU49Y Apple Mac mini MB138LL/A (1.83 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, 1 GB RAM, 80 GB Hard Drive, Combo Drive)]] to see if it can integrate into the pool of computers and lower that risk; in the mean time I'm disappointed by Toshiba and will keep them off my considerations, as well as anything more expensive such as [[ASIN:B000UDISEW Lenovo 765802U ThinkPad T61 14.1"" Notebook]] or  [[ASIN:B0013FNZ1M Apple MacBook MB404LL/A 13.3"" Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive) Black]] or as promising as [[ASIN:B000YEMKGY Asus Eee PC 4G (7"" Screen, 800 MHz Intel Celeron Processor, 512 MB RAM, 4 GB Hard Drive, Linux Preloaded) Galaxy Black]].<br /><br />Do you have the means to get the best car? Get a Porsche. Want the best computer money can buy? Move to another planet, on Earth you're going to have to make a compromise. I hope this helps."

After I did that, all my problems went away.<br />I'm using this to run an LG 5k Apple monitor on a PC. The camera and USB hub both work, and the monitor runs at 4k in Windows.<br /><br />After you install this card, go into your Asus BIOS, go to Advanced mode, find the Thunderbolt settings, and enable Thunderbolt. Make sure you tell the BIOS which slot you installed the card in -- I recommend the lowest slot to avoid hurting your GPU bandwidth. In the Thunderbolt menu, enable Thunderbolt, and also enable Thunderbolt USB and USB Boot -- even if you aren't going to boot from Thunderbolt, that is necessary to make the LG 5k monitor's camera and USB hub work.<br /><br />Obviously you are going to need a non-Thunderbolt monitor to see your BIOS while you set this up. Get an HDMI cable and use your TV as a monitor until you get the card working.

AFXRDEVBGBQT3YV5J5OHSUT6H6BA,B0BNPMD157,5,0,False,"TL;DR: I was expecting a cheap poorly-finished clone PC.  What I got is a very polished experience, with a ton of features and power and everything working just right out-of-the-box.<br /><br />For example, the packaging is nice.  Unlike so many interchangeable-clone items, not only is the box well labelled and branded, but the shrink-wrap even has an appropriate SKU bar code on it!  Interestingly, the SKU I received was ""GEEKOM Mini PC, Mini l..h Portable PC for Gift"".  No idea what ""for gift"" means, but the packaging was impeccable. Very Apple-like, other than being black and dark grey cardboard and foam.<br /><br />Under the PC, but above everything else, was a ""Thank You"" card.  Which told me Geekom is 20 years old!  (Among other things.)  That's pretty cool.  It also included a velvet carrying pouch, power brick and cords, HDMI cable, mounting plate and screws, and a sheet showing how to use the mount, what the ports are and how to add an internal SSD.<br /><br />About those ports - there are plenty.  Both a full-sized HDMI and a mini DisplayPort, network, two SS USBs and a USB 3.2 port on the back.  An SD card slot on one side, and what I suspect is a Kensington-compatible lock port on the other.  Two SS-USB ports and a head-phone out jack plus the power button on the front.<br /><br />I did not see an audio input, but it does seem to have a built in microphone.  My external mics and cameras-with-mics are all USB anyhow.<br /><br />Setup is nice and pretty.  It starts with the country and then keyboard layout, and then on to the internet.  This did require connecting a USB keyboard though, not included.  The mini PC does not come with a keyboard (which is fine) but also doesn't allow pairing a bluetooth keyboard at this stage.<br /><br />After the initial location, the installation is Windows 11 Pro, requiring internet.  Both wired and wifi are supported; I used wifi.<br /><br />This little system is pretty fast.  Windows reports  8GB RAM, i5 2.3GH 4-core CPU and 250GB drive.  I initially used it on a 4K 32"" monitor (rather than the 16"" monitor in the photo); no problems.<br /><br />In NovaBench, the CPU is pretty good and the disk score is extremely good.  GPU - not so much.  The Direct3D11 rating is 22FPS.  But it is using the integrated GPU on the Intel chip.<br /><br />In the photo, I have the Geekom mini PC, showing its product page, using the Ounshli portable monitor and the Samsers folding bluetooth keyboard/trackpad.  The monitor is getting both signal and power from the Geekom, power via the USB 3.2 port.<br /><br />The other photo shows everything packaged up.  The power cables for the Geekom just barely fit with it into the provided pouch.  (And yes, the Ounshli monitor comes with a cover, so you need to carry cables, and the Samsers keyboard folds also.)<br /><br />So, yeah, this is an amazing little system.

Well, this means that if you want packets coming in on eth1 to be copied to eth2... in other words, you want devices on the middle port to be able to talk to the far right... well, that slows this puppy WAY down.

Decently laid out, though a few connectors are in Siberia.<br /><br />There is one huge flaw, one glitch and one problem though.<br /><br />The glitch is really tiny... the SATA ports are mislabeled.  The high-speed SATA 0 and 1 ports are reverse of the documentation.  Which is only an issue when setting up finicky Windows boot loaders, and is easily fixed by swapping cables.<br /><br />The problem was, the CD that arrived had a crack in it.  You can download most of the drivers from Intel... kind-of, see below... but that's not everything that's on the CD, and it doesn't help so much when you need the drivers to get the network running.  Intel doesn't have the ability to replace broken CDs; they suggested I return the entire motherboard to get one with a functional CD.  (With some escalations, their management eventually decided this was inefficient and are sending me a CD.)<br /><br />Most of the drivers can, in theory, be downloaded, but the downloads... AREN'T REALLY DRIVERS.  You need the DLLs and INF files.  What you get are EXEs that expand and install those files only on systems with the correct hardware and software (which the downloading system wasn't for lack of an Intel board, and the target systems wasn't due to SBS 2011... next paragraph.)  But you can start the install, and when the error alert comes up, copy the desired files from the newly created directory in %TEMP% before clicking ok.<br /><br />The huge flaw is... it doesn't support SBS 2011, SBS 2008, Linux, etc.  Only specific versions of desktop client Windows.  So you pop the disc in and no options appear.  Most of these you can work around by first installing the IMEI package (which is the basic support) from Software/Drivers.  The LAN is trickier; the INF blocks SBS also, so in the Software/Drivers/LAN/Pro1000/Winx64/NDIS62 directory modify the winx64/e1c62x64.inf file, removing the data in the [ControlFlags] section and copying the missing lines from the [Intel.NTamd64.6.1.1] section into the [Intel.NTamd64.6.1] section below it.  Then the motherboard runs well.<br /><br />Once all that is done, everything flies in SBS 2011.<br /><br />Over all, I'm very happy.  The board works well, and other than Intel explicitly trying to block it working with server software (which cost some time to work-around), was easy to set up.  Next time, though, if I'm installing something other that normal Windows, I may go ASUS or some other vendor that doesn't try to control what I put on it."

AE45S6P3435ZQNL4TMCDPK2KXO3Q,B000OFXKFI,5,63,True,"My CyberPower CP 1350 AVR LCD Intelligent UPS device (battery backup and surge suppression) arrived two days ago (purchased on Amazon).  The first thing that happened when I plugged it in was a red light on in the back of it, &#34;Wiring fault.&#34;  I looked it up and on the Cyberpowersystems.support page it says, &#34;The wiring fault light indicates that the outlet that the unit is connected to is either not properly grounded or has reversed wiring. First, try connecting the unit to another outlet. If the unit still displays the electrical wiring fault, contact technical support for assistance.  If the unit does not display the wiring fault light in the new outlet, you will need to have an electrician correct the problem with the faulty outlet.&#34;  So, after trying it on another outlet and also got a red light with that one, I called CyberPower.  I just want to say how polite and attentive the CyberPower guys are on the telephone.  I have since called them with more questions about hooking up the unit, and each time (3 different guys) they were knowledgeable and solved the problem quickly. The red light problem went as follows:  they said that the outlets probably are not grounded, and if all your outlets give the red light, it could mean that your house doesn't have grounded outlets.  I was surprised, since almost all of my outlets have 3-prong plugs; the 3-prongs are supposed to be for grounded units, but people can install a 3-prong on an outlet that is not grounded, and that still does not make it grounded.  Very important to know!  So, I bought a &#34;receptable tester&#34; at Lowe's for $5 and tried out the outlets in my house and discovered that certain rooms did not have grounded outlets, while other rooms did.  (Just want to add that you can do this without buying a receptacle tester, if you have a surge protector power strip with the two lights on it that say &#34;Protected&#34; and &#34;Grounded.&#34;  If the &#34;Grounded&#34; light doesn't light up or is DIM, then that outlet is NOT grounded - same thing with the receptacle tester - the two lights on the right should be fully on - if the middle one is bright and the one on the right is DIM then your outlet is NOT grounded.  My electrician confirmed this.  At first, he thought maybe the center light was reflecting in the right light, but it was DIM.  He tested the outlet with his other tools, and said it was NOT grounded.)  It dawned on me that the rooms that had grounded outlets were built 1970s or later, and the rooms that did not have grounded outlets were installed with the original house, built in 1955.  Unfortunately, the rooms I need to use the CyberPower device in are the old part of the house where my office is.  I'm sharing this information, because there are likely to be others who will experience this same situation.  If your house is an older house, it is likely that the outlets in some rooms (the older ones) are not grounded, which means you need to call in a professional electrician and have a new, grounded, outlet installed.  A new grounded outlet involves putting in a separate line from the main electric box in your house, all the way to the spot where you want an outlet to hook up your UPS device.  For many people this isn't difficult.  For me it was problematic since my basement is finished, with paneling and ceiling tiles all around, and there were only two teeny possible places in the ceilings of closets where the electrician could try to drill a hole up into the wall for an outlet on the first floor.  It took him several hours, but he was finally about to get around the heating ducts and struts, and with the aid of a special drill extender he was able to get two new, grounded, outlets installed in my first-floor office.  I had him install two, although I only needed one, so I'd have plenty of outlets for digital devices that need grounding.  It did cost me, but now I can be confident that my electronics will be protected with grounding, surge suppression, and battery backup.<br /><br />The second problem I faced was when I hooked up the UPS to my new (replacement model) Comcast &#34;wireless gateway&#34; modem/router, and wanted the WiFi signal to go out, not from the Comcast unit, but from my Apple Time Capsule unit.  I'm sharing this info because I feel certain that others will run into this, too.  I followed the Comcast instructions with one exception - the Comcast cable comes out of the wall and into the cable &#34;input&#34; of the CyberPower UPS device.  Then you need another cable coming out of the CyberPower unit, from the cable &#34;output&#34; into the Comcast modem/router.  So, I thought I had everything hooked up correctly, but it didn't work.  I called Comcast and had to talk with an intake person for about twenty minutes before they would pass me to a tech specialist.  They helped me get it set up, but after we got off the phone, my Apple Time Capsule continued to blink amber (yellow) and didn't go to the green light.  When I checked in the Time Machine app, there was a message, &#34;Double NAT.&#34;  I looked that up, and it means you have two WiFi systems running.  So, even though the Comcast guy told me he was disabling the WiFi on my Comcast unit so that signals would go out through my Time Capsule, there was still this problem.  The Comcast guy told me he couldn't help me any more, have to call Apple.  So I called Apple.  Apple is always very nice, but the intake person didn't know what to do about the yellow light.  He passed me to a WiFi specialist at Apple, and that guy knew exactly what to do.  So here is what you should do if your Apple Time Capsule keeps blinking amber (yellow) after you have your CyberPower and Comcast set up:  Look in Applications - Utilities - AirPort Utility.  The Internet icon should have a green light to the left of it.  If the Time Capsule icon has an amber (yellow) light to the left of it, simply double-click on the amber light in the picture.  It will open a small window.  Again, see the yellow circle there and click on it.  You will see a small drop-down that has the option &#34;Ignore.&#34;  --&#62;  CLICK ON IGNORE.  That is the solution.  The Apple guy says &#34;We get this all the time.&#34;  There are other solutions you will see online, including something about &#34;bridge.&#34;  Don't do that.  Just click &#34;ignore&#34; and you'll be all set from there on out.<br /><br />One other difficulty I had was plugging devices into the CyberPower unit.  I thought something was wrong.  The situation is, when you plug things into the unit for the first time, it takes a lot of muscle to shove them into the sockets.  Right out of the factory, the plugs are tight.  So just use your strength and force them in.  After that, it's no problem at all.<br /><br />I set the CyberPower unit on the floor near the Comcast outlet and modem, and hooked up my computer speaker system and Time Capsule near it.  That keeps all the wires in the same area, and off my desk.  I have a 14-gauge (9-foot) heavy duty extension cord running from the CyberPower unit to my iMac desktop.  I purchased the extension cord on Amazon, too.  The CyberPower guys said to get a 14-gauge &#34;one-to-one&#34; extension cord.  That means that each electronic device you put on an extension cord coming out of the UPS device needs to have its own extension cord - this is important.  This is why I moved my Time Capsule and speakers over to plug in directly to the CyberPower device on the floor.  So my desk has just one cord coming off of it, no spaghetti mess of wires all over the place, just on the floor in the corner.  The extension cord I picked is a neutral gray, and very flexible:<br />http://www.amazon.com/Heavy-Conditioner-Major-Appliance-Extension/dp/B013Q5DOZ8?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00<br /><br />One last comment - this is a most impressive looking machine.  It is big and very solid.  It is also VERY HEAVY.  Other than the things I mentioned, I have had no problem with the device.  I have a new grounded outlet now, and I managed to get a Comcast modem hooked through it, and the WiFi signal to go through my Apple Time Capsule, which I'm sure many of you have.  So I hope this info helps some of you out there.  I am very happy with my purchase, and now thinking I will buy another one for my TV and sound system in the recreation room (which is in the newer part of the house and has grounded outlets!).  If I ever do have a problem with it, I will report back!  Happy customer, and very happy with the CyberPower tech guys!"

Since VOIP now allows me to use the NoMoRobo robocall blocking service - I also enjoy an advantage from the CPR V5000 for that, too.  By COMBINING both the NoMoRobo and the CPR V5000, I don't get that first nuisance ring from NoMoRobo while it screens.  So:<br /><br />  + CPR V5000 blocks the first ring as it evaluate the call, then<br />  + NoMoRobo also blocks its own set of robocallers - but it still rings your phone while it screens (first ring, only)<br />------<br />  = However by combining both:  CPR V5000 blocks that first, nuisance ring from NoMoRobo.  And if both screeners are satisfied, I do hear a ring:  at which point, it has been screened by both, both have allowed it, so it's likely a legitimate call that I want to receive.<br /><br />Plus I can also check caller history periodically to assure I'm receiving the calls I want - both at the CPR V5000 panel, and at my VOIP provider's log.<br /><br />Really pleased.  Keep up the good work with CPR V5000, guys.<br /><br />-<br /><br />Original review - May 2016<br /><br />Hey gang. If you're like me, you worry about the plight of poor Lisa (you know... &#34;Hi!  This is Lisa!  And I'm calling you about ...&#34;) ... at which point, I haven't the heart to listen to poor Lisa because I know that our sweet, perky, intelligent, well-spoken Lisa has traded in her integrity to bring me rapturous news of some ill-begotten time share or Ponzi scheme.  I have to hang up out of sheer torment for her immortal soul.  But now:  I needn't go through that ethical quandary, because this box hangs up on Lisa for me.<br /><br />On the plus side, once a number gets manually programmed in - by yours truly - the V5000 faithfully does the rest. On the minus side, I believe the 5000 pre-programmed numbers are stale and just can't be expected to keep up with the ever-changing cycle of fraudulent caller IDs the crooks are using.<br /><br />I regard the V5000 as an interim solution until the FCC and Congress ever decide to act to end robocalls ... possibly in my own lifetime."

This runs cool<br />• Battery life = Long and efficient, once you tune settings and remove unwanted apps<br />• Ease of use = Ultra light weight, beautiful edge-to-edge display (tip:  I combine mine with a grippy third-party holder for ease of handling)<br /><br />Cons:<br />• Chip architecture runs most, but not all, Android apps.  (Only runs Android apps supported for Intel - but the prominent chip for Android apps is ARM, instead.)  If your favorite app is not supported, it’s probably going to be a deal-breaker for you.<br />• App compatibility can change as publishers add/remove Intel support from their new releases of Android apps.  (First-hand experience with this issue.) Do your own research – then live with (potentially changing) results.<br />• Discontinued model – no new Android versions, no more system security updates – though you can still update individual apps with newer releases, uninstall, and replace apps.  Dell discontinued its entire mobile product line in June 2016.<br /><br />Suggested use:  A fine secondary Android tablet for your home or travel use - if your apps are supported.  Won’t support apps written exclusively for dominant chip architecture for Android (ARM) - and as a discontinued series, there are no more system or security updates pushed by Dell.  Since future use is limited, I’d watch for a low price, before buying.<br /><br />My review here had a long history of changes since first authored in Feb 2015.  As a service to buyers, I’m paring it down to above summary only now, but you’ll detect in the comments history that it raised lots of useful discussion and even some controversy.  My rating for this model has changed radically in response to altered app compatibility and Dell's eventual discontinuance of its mobile line.  When my own favorite app received a mandatory publisher update which could no longer be run on an Intel chip, I ultimately bought a different, ARM-based Android tablet to replace this tablet, well before end of useful life should have occurred for this Dell model, so I felt genuinely burned as a consumer and reflected that into my review history as well.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you know and accept the limitations, this is still an amazing work of engineering.  Assuming you get a good unit, and at a low price, you’ll get some nice, if limited, use from it.  It’s still my own favorite tablet for travel use, for instance."

AFRT7HUNPJTJWVP27IKOW25QUWQQ,B004H8FNJY,5,4,False,"I purchased this camera for my wife as a birthday present. She previously had a Nikon Coolpix that had horrible problems with taking blurry pictures, and the battery compartment cover had broken off just from normal use. I have a Canon DSLR so we also like to have a compact point and shoot for when I don't feel like lugging the Canon around.<br /><br />I decided on the Sony WX9 after reading tons of reviews. Here are some features that we really like on this model after a few weeks of use:<br /><br />*LCD Screen: The LCD Screen is really beautiful. It is higher resolution than a lot of other competitive cameras and pictures and video look great.<br /><br />*Picture Quality: Most of the pictures have come out looking great. We really put this camera to the test by visiting Disneyland where she took about 600 pictures in two days. Photos in well lit outdoor environment look beautiful, with accurate colors and good crispness. Pictures from indoor but well lit environments also look great. We took a bunch of pictures in a restaurant with moderate lighting, and the camera compensates well without getting too grainy. Night shots have come out acceptable. Obviously point-and-shoots aren't going to have fantastic low light performance, but I think this model has probably the best low-light performance that I've seen in similar price range cameras.<br /><br />*iSweep Panorama: This is a great feature starting to pop up on a few cameras. It might be a little gimmicky for more professional photogs, but it has never been easier to make really great panorama shots without having to worry about manual stitching. Just push the shutter, sweep the camera, and you're done. You can take panoramas in landscape or portrait orientation.<br /><br />*1080p Video: The video coming from this camera is really fantastic. It's finally getting to the point where having separate photo and video cameras is no longer necessary for the average consumer. The video quality we got matches our dedicated camcorder purchased only a few years ago. Obviously it doesn't have the feature set and zoom capability of a camcorder, but the image quality is nearly the same.  We bought a 16GB PNY SD card which can hold about 4 hours of HD video. In addition, the image stabilization works great on the video. We used to have a Flip video camera which suffered from horrible shakiness when shooting by hand. The video from the WX9 is silky smooth.<br /><br />*Scene modes: We liked the different scene modes available. The blurred background mode that replicates the depth of field effect you get on a SLR camera worked fairly well and makes for great pictures. There's also a few very specific modes that seem a bit useless including ""Pet Mode"" and ""Food Mode"". We took some pictures of my parents dog with Pet Mode enabled and not enabled, and couldn't tell the difference, so not really sure what the point of it is.<br /><br />*Intelligent Auto: We used this the most because as you're walking around Disneyland taking a ton of photos it's tedious to keep having to change the scene mode. iAuto automatically decides what the best scene mode is (Landscape, Portrait, Backlit, etc.) and adjusts on the fly without you having to worry about it. It displays on the LCD screen which scene mode it's using which is cool as well. 95% of pictures taken using iAuto mode came out beautifully.<br /><br />Things we didn't like:<br /><br />*Battery life:  If you're using all of the features of this camera, especially video recording, the battery will suffer. As I said before the first field test for this camera was 2 days at Disneyland, where we took about 300 pictures per day. The stock battery got extremely low after about 150 pictures and some video recording. Her previous Nikon Coolpix could go a whole day (~300 pictures) on one charge. Luckily we purchased a Wasabi pack which included 2 extra batteries (Highly Recommended, just search for Wasabi batteries matching this model camera -- much cheaper than Sony batteries and last just as long -- also includes extra charger and car adapter).<br /><br />*Camera Interface: We both agree that the user interface for the camera is a little bit clunky. Can't really put a reason on why but navigating the menus just seems a little weird and slow. Not a huge negative, just something we noticed.<br /><br />*Unfortunately we could not sample the 3D capabilities because we do not have a 3D TV.<br /><br />All in all, we are very pleased with this purchase so far."
AHRWER7D6ZCMSFIR7LVKDKQZR2KA,B00LCM2BK2,2,19,True,"[EDIT: UPDATE 2014-10-12: The people at this laptop seller's company, Computer Upgrade King USA, have reached out to me and are actively researching these problems and acting as an intermediary with Gigabyte to resolve these issues, which I think is pretty awesome. I also want to recommend http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/ for isolating monitor problems.]<br /><br />I *really* wanted to love this laptop. In fact, it was one of the best laptops I've ever used, hands down. I absolutely *LOVE* how it will go from 80 C (under extreme load) to 40 C in less than 20 seconds. I love how cool it is and how I don't need a cooling pad not to get burned. I *LOVE* how rocking fast it is, especially with the RAID SSDs. I also totally frickin dig how they have Windows 7 x64 drivers for (almost) every device!<br /><br />But the downsides, while few compared to practically all laptops, are very severe (ranked by severity ascending):<br />1. It comes with the shortest power cord I've ever seen in a device, much less a laptop. I measured it, I was in such disbelief: 2 feet for the wall cord, 1 1/2 feet for the computer cord. I couldn't even sit on the sofa with the thing (the power cord wouldn't reach to the middle seat!). It was very, maddening, restraining, esp. since I bought this because it is so light (~6.7 lbs).<br />2. There are two fundamentally missing drivers for Windows 7 x64, which were incredibly hard to find, relatively: Intel 7260AC wifi driver (conspicuously missing from their downloads page) and the Monitor driver.<br /><br />3. The LCD monitor never seemed to work properly, however, particularly while watching movies, that the screen banded in high contrasts (like flood lights, stars, etc.). Not as bad as 16-bit banding, but not nearly 32-bit. I tested my setup and it was stuck in 24-bit mode. I tried everything under the Sun, invested over 30 hours into finding a solution. Nothing. The monitor's issues also continued in Linux. On a lark, and to see if it fixed other issues listed below, I begrudgingly reinstalled Windows 8, but no.<br /><br />I contacted tech support and this is what they said, in total: ""Kindly note that the screen does not support 32-bit color."" Man. I've never owned a laptop that didn't!<br /><br />Here's a picture where you can see the banding. Taken from the HD Star Trek: Into Darkness: https://www.dropbox.com/s/8owd5kdbz2806wp/Aorus_X7v2_24bit_Color_Depth_issue.png?dl=0<br /><br />4. The Intel 7260AC wifi adapter. Seriously, google it, combined with the terms ""latency"" or ""packet loss."" This thing is HORRIBLE! I spent at least 20 hours trying to get it to work. I even reinstalled Windows 8 where it's quality was better but still bad. Linux *hated* the thing.<br /><br />As far as I can tell, the WIFI adapter could only handle one connection at a time well, and maybe 2 or 3 connections at a time max. I was never, ever, able to use bittorrent with it. More than 5 connections via a downloader and the internet ground to the halt. It was so ridiculous! I would open up the cmd.exe and ping -n 1000 8.8.8.8 and would get 20% packet loss if I was doing NOTHING. If I started browsing news sites, it'd jump to 60% packet loss. I then realized that if I played a game or anything involving the GPU, I got nothing but 100% packet failure. Yeah, the card stopped working during gameplay. On a gaming laptop.<br /><br />I tried every Intel 7260AC driver from 13.x to their latest 18.0.1. I've tried every single frickin setting, to such a degree that I have a complex spreadsheet of all the options I tried (so I could keep track). I reinstalled Windows 8 and it went down to 20-30% during active browsing and ""only"" 50% loss during gameplay, but that is still intolerable. Also, the max speed I ever got was around 700 kb/sec, with periodic jumps to 1-1.5 MB/sec on a connection that routinely does 5 MB/sec (FiOS).<br /><br />I bought a $20 USB Wifi adapter, and that worked fine.  But still, ti's a $2,400 laptop.<br /><br />5. Bluetooth (part of the Intel 7260AC card) never worked. I never successfully got it to team with any device, at least in Windows 7. Maybe a driver issue.<br /><br />6. Even other radio devices, such as my logitech mouse and keyboard had latency issues!! My keyboard would lose about 1/2 of the keystrokes during gameplay and 1/8 during routine usage. It was *intolerable*. I still have no idea why.<br /><br />7. There is ZERO, absolutely ZERO customer support! If customer support contacts me via this review, it will only tell me they are more in damage control than not. I submitted separate tickets to customer support for the issues #2, 3, 5, 6, and 7. Over 5 issues over the course of a month. And ... NOTHING, except for #4, a one sentence reply (see above).<br /><br />So, sadly, I'd have to say, avoid this laptop ;-( It gets *so* much right, awesomely right, but forsakes a lot of basics in the process."

AGUPC2GIFISLROTSFD7MTGXT4HTQ,B005IKZU8O,4,4,False,"I have been using SLRs for 35 years and my current collection includes a Canon Rebel XSi (four years old and my favorite) and a Canon Rebel T3i (six months old).  After about 20 hours of use, I'll compare the Sony NEX-7 to the oldest Canon for biggest contrast.<br /><br />Image Quality - better than my Canon Rebel (and the Canon takes great photos).  For the money this camera costs, it's reasonable not to try and compare image quality to a $4000 camera or shots by a skilled photographer (which I use at work) but I'll put my photos against some of the pros with cameras that cost twice as much.<br /><br />Image Size - No contest.  The NEX-7 has twice the megapixels of the XSi.  Most of the time, I don't need more megapixels but it's nice to have them when you need them.  I prefer homemade art to store bought and I can put the NEX-7 images on canvas without resorting to Photoshop upscaling.<br /><br />Image Options - Here's where the NEX-7 beats the old Canon.  I love the 16x9 panoramic option and the low light photos on the NEX-7 don't require serious Photoshopping like the Canon's.  On fast action shots, I saw no difference between the two.  I was blown away by the Sweep Panorama that took and stitched together moving shots.  The photos I took of the yard required no editing.  Photos of the kids splashing in the pool created ripples in the water that the stitching couldn't match.  If I'm switching rapidly between portrait, landscape, and fast action shots, I just set the camera on Intelligent Auto.<br /><br />Shutter Speed - So fast as to be no issue at all.  I had to get used to the touch to avoid accidentally taking multiple shots.<br /><br />Controls - Unlike the Canon, you can't easily use this camera without reading the manual.  But the manual is very short and the controls are easy to learn.  I was pleased to see that I can read the options on the LCD screen without my glasses.  I look forward to David Busch's guide to this camera (not yet in print) to refine my techniques.<br /><br />Video - While I can get better video on a dedicated camcorder, I find myself not using the expensive models I own and choosing instead to use my inexpensive, easy-to-use, easy to transport, easy-to-download Flip.  Thus, I only have to compare video quality (for my use) to the Flip camera.  Well this camera beats the Flip but not without complications.  For an easy to understand review of the video options, I suggest imaging-resource (dot)com/PRODS/NEX7/NEX7VIDEO (dot) HTM.  You'll be able to see that even the smallest video option records clear video and you may find stepping down the recording resolution makes it easier to download and view video. iMovie in OSX can't handle AVCHD without using third party converters (Handbrake, Roxio Toast 10 Titanium, Total Video Converter), but VLC can.  You also can download the video in AVCHD on a Windows machine or record in MP4.  The latest versions of Final Cut and Adobe Premiere can edit AVCHD.  I find that my AVCHD recordings are grainy and larger than I need.  I'm fairly satisfied with the stepdown to MP4 videos.<br /><br />Diopter (view finder) - In low light, it has the appearance of a ghost-finder's low-light camera.  It's brighter than the Canon but looks grainy and flickers.  Outside the image appears over-saturated and has waves like would be produced by hot pavement.  It's still useable but I can't tell as easily when I have taken a great shot like I can with the Canon.  Don't forget to attach the eyepiece cup.<br /><br />Swivel LCD Screen - The reason I bought the Rebel T3i was for the flexible view-finder which I had had with an earlier camera.  Once you get used to having it, you find yourself using it all the time to get better positions for photos.  I don't find the flexibility on the NEX-7 to be as good as on the T3I but I'm still very glad to have it.  I also find the NEX-7 LCD harder to view in bright light than the Canon's.<br /><br />Grip - At first I was put off by the smaller grip of the NEX-7 but it works fine and totally unnoticeable after a minute.<br /><br />Size & Weight - Although the difference in weight between the two is virtually undetectable, the NEX-7 is about 40% less bulky, making it more transportable and less obvious when you are taking photos.  But the weight and size of the Canon was never an issue for me.<br /><br />Lens - extremely easy to change.<br /><br />Battery Cover - requires manual locking.  If not securely locked, the battery separates from contacts and quits working.  I prefer the Canon's snap-close cover.<br /><br />Flashcard - hard for large hands to remove.  Remember to format in the camera and reformat whenever you remove all of the media off the camera to keep it unfragmented.<br /><br />Software - ""The Sony camera firmware update does not support the 64 bit kernel on Mac OSX 10.5 or higher."" They provide a workaround for booting into 32 bit.  I ended up installing the software on Windows 7 running via Parallels.  Go to esupport dot sony dot com for drivers, software, and troubleshooting.  You don't need to install any software to access your images or movies (AVCHD).  Just move them off your card.<br /><br />Photo Numbering - repeats numbers so that I can't add new photos to folder containing old photos.  I got a new 32 GB flashcard and formatted it in the camera but the new photos started at 9417 and all the images are dated Jan. 2011.  Can anyone explain that?  I tried updating the firmware but discovered that I have to reboot my 64-bit iMac into 32-bit mode (reportedly by by holding the 3 and 2 keys during startup) so I'll wait until I go into work and just update via Windows.<br /><br />Pros - photo quality, image size, shutter speed, physical size, shooting pre-sets.<br />Cons - diopter, AVCHD video quality.<br /><br />Addendum:  The more I use this camera, the more impressed I am with it.  I have dropped it twice, causing it to momentarily lose focus (I think it's human) and then it would start working fine again.  Although I continue to largely use the basic settings, the quality of my photos continues to improve.  I've been using quality equipment for almost 40 years so it is definitely camera quality that is improving, not me."

I also use other devices such as 3D Connexion Spacenavigators and Quickeys.  I even used to draw on an old HP TC1100.<br /><br />I was glad to receive the Veikk VK1200.  Came nicely packaged.  Pretty box.  Serviceable quickstart guide.<br /><br />For its basic tablet functionality, the VEIKK is easily comparable to my old Wacom tablets.  The express keys are mappable in all my standard apps (After Effects, PhotoShop, Illustrator, Cinema4D, ZBrush).  And the screen is actually quite comparable to my old TC1100, which means a tiny bit of pen offset.  But since I've never used a Cintiq I'm used to it.  The color is actually equivalent or better than that of my HP VH240a and 32s monitors.  I really like the screen texture.  One of the problems I've had with my iPad and with the old TC1100 was the super slippery texture of the screens.  Without a transparent film covering you had no way to get that 'paper feel.'  Thankfully the VK1200 has a screen coating that gives you a suitable drawing texture.  Not paper.  But very good.<br /><br />If its been a while since you upgraded or used your old Wacom, you won't really notice a difference other than the somewhat less comprehensive feeling of 'institutional support' that comes with a larger, more familiar name.  If I was starting a large studio, without question I'd go with Wacom for peace of mind.  But for personal use (especially image retouching) VK1200 is perfectly fine.<br /><br />The pen is comparable in quality to what you get with a Wacom (you get two and a bunch of nibs).  The lower end Veikk tablets come with inferior pens, but this one is very nice.  A tiny bit less robust and ergonomic than a Wacom pen.  But at the listed price I'm very impressed.<br /><br />The screen space is small for drawing...  However I'm used to drawing on an iPad and a 10.6"" TC1100 tablet, so I can make due with the cramped space.  But if you are JUST getting into illustration on computers, from working large on paper, you WILL need something larger (VK2200).  This tablet is optimal for those who need a portable or are working on smaller, more detailed items (texture painting, vector icons, photo retouching, finishing up digital sculptures).<br /><br />The tablet is a good weight.  Comfortable for use in your lap.  And cable length is great.  About 5 feet.  Its two separate cables instead of a paired cable, but for me its the perfect length for use.<br /><br />This tablet was installed on a new PC build (HP Prodesk with GTX 1660).  So I don't have multiple tablets installed. But I suspect there would be no conflicts with existing drivers.  I was also able to install it as the primary display on a GKmini micro PC with Intel GPU.  No problems.<br /><br />Its a professional product all around that punches above its weight considering price.<br /><br />A true pauper's Cintiq...<br /><br />Very recommended at this low price point."

My workstation has displayport, so I need the Windows Mixed Reality &#34;recommended&#34; Club3D Displayport 1.2 to HDMI 2.0 UHD (CAC-1070).<br /><br />On another note, I think this is the heaviest, sturdiest build of all the current VR headsets.  Noticeable if you have tried some of the others.  Not noticeable if this is your first...  If you search the Internet you can find replacement rubbers for the face portion which may eliminate any light leak at the cost of ventilation - or reduce the amount of padding to get your eyes closer to the screens (try vrcover).<br /><br />If you google, you can also find 3rd party prescription lens addons (designed for RIFT and VIVE) and info on IPD settings to help wth focus.  You can also use your existing prescription to purchase a very cheap set of Zenni glasses online to use in the headset (only $15!).  Use model #550021 and get the anti-reflective coating.  No need for any other features.  The arms are super thin and the lenses are large and give a great FOV (there is a guy on youtube demoing them using the product number).  If you purchase this particular set, you'll also be ready for any 3D printed VR headset adapters that appear on Thingmaker.

It is very easy to install and it was my first time building my own pc. It was a snap, though the stock fan feels a little cheap plastic, it is fine if you are not going to overclock.<br /><br />The problem I had with the heatsink fan is that the wires that goes around it can hit the fan blades which causing some loud noises. I didn't realized what the noise was and it slightly damaged the wire rubber though it didn't affect anything. This maybe a QC issue with Intel."

AG375WAXLZ7PIOQKIQ6KQB4J3JVQ,B0928NR8PD,5,0,False,"I really like this camera. It was very easy to setup. First, you need to charge the battery for 8-10 hours. Then you need download the app from the app store (I have android and it was marked as google certified). The app was surprisingly clean and easy to use. Pairing the device was super simple by following the on screen app instructions. All you need is a descent wifi connection. Once the app and camera are paired you can manage the camera settings via that app.<br /><br />I do not have a lot of sunlight in the area I plan to keep the camera. However, I am pleasantly surprised that after one day of usage it is still at 98% battery! This is great. I started out on high sensitivity for the first few hours and lowered to medium. The second day when I was doing more testing it only dropped to 95%. Once you get a push notification you can click to open the video. From the app you also have the option to download the video to your device. You can also share a video. I was quickly able to click share, select messages and the contact and it sent right away. Very easy. I was able to see the video I shared with my contact, but my contact was not able to open the video. Not sure what's up with that.<br /><br />You can also watch the camera live with or without sound, sound an alarm, hold to speak through the camera and turn on a white light. When the motion detection is triggered you can set it to turn on a small blue light, bright white light or no light at all. I have always had the blue light setting. If you have the white light setting then I'm sure it would use more battery.<br /><br />There are a few different lighting options. The night vision infrared mode is the best in my environment. It's black and white, but better than the white light in my opinion. I'm not sure which setting consumes the most battery though. Maybe if I spent some more time to determine which option was best for the battery then I may make a change.<br /><br />You have multiple options to install the camera to your structure. It comes with two brackets that have a ball joint so you can adjust and tilt the camera and solar panel as needed. Also, it comes with a magnetic bracket that also will allow you to adjust the camera. The solar panel will not attach to the magnetic bracket, just the camera. You can also just set it on a ledge. The camera is pretty heavy so it would take some real strong wind to blow it off. My favorite option is to just stick it on a piece of metal. For example, I was able to stick it on a downspout and a crossbar that is underneath a deck. The magnet is very strong. If you are lucky to have something like this in the area you want to monitor then installation is as easy and sticking two magnets together. The only issue with sticking it to a flat surface is that you lose the ability to rotate and tilt on a ball joint. Either way it is a very nice feature that I am lucky to take advantage of.<br /><br />There are 4 service options. The ""No plan"" is free and comes with 7 days of cloud recording and up to 1gb of storage. Additionally, there is a basic, plus and pro plan that comes with 15, 30 and 60 days of recording and up to 3, 5 and 10 gb, respectively. With the three paid plans ($3-$8/month) you get intelligent notifications and activity zones.<br /><br />The is an awareness service (intelligent notification) must use machine learning and artificial intelligence to detect and classify objects. For example, cars coming/going pets, people and packages delivered/picked up.<br /><br />The activity zone allows you to specify certain areas in the camera view. For example, you could set the activity zone to be right around a window or door and essentially ignore surrounding bushes or trees that are still in the camera view. This would likely eliminate notifications from birds and squirrels playing in the trees.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend.<br /><br />This camera is made in China and being sold by Chinese company on Amazon."
AGF3GTGWVWB7QONIOHQMYOVQFAJA,B01AWGXN00,5,8,False,I absolutely love the Samsung NP900X3L-K06US Notebook 9 13.3&#34; Laptop. Love the HD 1920 x 1080 pixel resolution screen. Super clear and bright. The laptop is extremely lightweight. The battery charges quickly and lasts all day for my use and I am on the laptop a lot. Love using the Windows 10 and the Intel Core i5 makes this laptop really fast and videos are super sharp. Also I love the backlit keyboard. The keyboard has a nice spring to it and makes it easy to key quickly.  All in all this laptop is superb. Love it!!!

Here's an overview of my thoughts:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Tech specs are exceptional for the price.<br />- Screen flips over 360 degrees to become a feasible tablet.  It's fairly heavy in this mode, but it works.  It's also possible to set it up on an angle, like you would do with a tablet case while watching movies.  You won't need a case with this, however.<br />- Recovers from hibernation in a blink.  Boots up quickly.<br />- Buttons are nicely recessed in the keyboard, so they don't trigger in alternate modes.<br />- Minimal amount of bloatware.  Much nicer than most of the HPs I typically purchase, where it takes me a few hours to remove all of the trials and useless stuff.  It comes with a program called &#34;Asus Install&#34; which can quickly remove (or add) some unwanted programs.<br />- Touchscreen and mouse are responsive.<br />- 16 GB of online storage is provided for free.<br />- Case is metalic, seems incredibly sturdy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Windows 8.1 (don't get me started on this one...but I guess we don't really have too much choice in modern laptops)<br />- The tablet mode is significantly heavier than what you'll get with models with detachable screens.<br />- Number pad on the keyboard off-sets the mouse pad (which I find very annoying)<br />- No CD drive (I'm still old school in wanting this on any laptop)<br />- Sound quality is good, but buttons are awkwardly placed when using the computer in a different mode (i.e. as a tablet or movie screen).<br /><br />All of the cons can easily be worked around, and are mostly personal quirks more than significant downsides.  A 5-star laptop for sure."

As a comparison, if you went to Dell's formal business class unit (the Dell Latitude) in the same spec, you would pay considerably more.<br /><br />This unit is perfect for a student, for the family PC or even for light gaming.

AELW7TMEO7INILU2GBIVI2CLGR3A,B092YHJLS6,5,1,False,"I'm not a huge fan of gaming laptops in general (desktop preferred). And Acer would not normally come to mind when you think of high-end gaming systems (Alienware or ASUS are probably more likely to be on you list). However, with the specs on this Acer Predator Helios 300 PH315-54-760S, it deserves a spot VERY close to the top of your list! And price point is very competitive floating around (depending on when/where you purchase) $1300.00 - 1400.00.<br /><br />FULL SPECS:<br /><br />CPU: 11th Gen Intel Core i7 11800H | 8 Core | 16 Threads | 24 MB of level 3 Cache | 2.3 GHz | 4.6 GHz<br /><br />RAM: 16GB | DDR4 3200MHz | Single Channel 2x SO-DIMM Slots<br /><br />Storage: 512GB SSD | 1x 2.5-inch SATA Slot for SSD/HDD Expansion | 2x M.2 Slots<br /><br />GPU: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 6 GB VRAM | Intel UHD Graphics Xe 750 32EUs<br /><br />Display: 15.6 Inches | FHD (1920 x 1080) | LG Philips LP156WFG-SPF3 | 144Hz<br /><br />Battery: 58 Watt hour<br /><br />Operating System: Windows 10<br /><br />Ports: 3x USB 3.0 (Type A) | HDMI | Rj- 45 Ethernet Jack | 1x Thunderbolt 4 Type C | Mini-DisplayPort | 3.5 mm Combo Audio Jack<br /><br />Other Features: Keyboard: Backlit, Chicklet Style | Weight:2.2 Kg | Additional Features: Bluetooth 5, Thunderbolt 4, Wifi 6<br /><br />WHO IS THIS FOR?<br /><br />Gamers of course! This unit can handle most AAA games with ease, but is also an excellent unit for students (that may double as gamers at night) or anyone that needs a powerful system to render video, audio, software development or any other high-end processing.<br /><br />NOTES WORTH MENTIONING:<br /><br />PREMIUM BUILD - Aluminum (mostly) with some plastic. Huge exhaust vents (on the sides & back.) And only 5lbs. This is a full-size laptop without the full-size weight. Although it can get a little loud when fans ramp up under load. But that happens in bursts (as to be expected) to bring system down to operable temps.<br /><br />CPU - 11th Gen / i7 / 8 Octa-Core Intel CPU. Some may argue that an AMD proc would be better suited here. However, this generation Intel processor can go head-to-head with an AMD Ryzen without missing a beat.<br /><br />DISPLAY  - Huge 15.6 FHD IPS display running at 144Hz with 3ms response time. Can achieve up to 4k resolutions @ 60fps. Enough said.<br /><br />RAM & STORAGE - Although it is dual-channel, you will get 16GB of RAM. It's also very nice to see 512GB of PCIe Gen4 SSD storage as many laptops offering 256GB are considered high-end.<br /><br />OS - 64 bit Windows 10 with free upgrade to Windows 11. Ships only with Home. Pro would have been nice.<br /><br />GRAPHICS - The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 GPU with 6GB of VRAM makes short work of your gaming needs. You can dig into the geeky specs yourself, but just know that you can get 60fps at 1080p on most games without issue.<br /><br />FUTURE PROOFING - 3x USB 3.0, HDMI, RJ45 Gigabit Ethernet (becoming harder to find as laptops continue to shrink in size), Thunderbolt 4 (Type C) port, Mini DisplayPort jack, 3.5 surround sound DTSX audio out (although some reviews say the audio is a little flat, I've found no issues with it), 2x M.2 slots, Backlit keyboard, Bluetooth 5 & Wifi 6. Lot's of expansion options here. This unit is pretty tricked out for a laptop. Oddly, there is no memory card reader???<br /><br />BATTERY LIFE - Don't expect stellar run time if you're gaming (or doing any resource intensive activities). Acer states 6 hours battery life on a full charge. However, I would say more like average of 2-3hrs depending on your power save settings, applications, etc.. That's to be expected. Run off of AC power to avoid any issues. And battery charges to full capacity in about 2 hrs."
AELW7TMEO7INILU2GBIVI2CLGR3A,B08YX6976Q,4,0,False,"The hardware profile of this Surface 4 laptop really allows it to shine under load. An 11th Gen Intel i5 processor, 8GB of RAM & 512GB NVme hard disk makes this unit very responsive & entirely solid state (no moving parts to wear out over time). As well, it's almost silent while running & heat dissipation seems to be well dialed in.<br /><br />Because of this profile (and no onboard optical drive) the unit is very thin & lightweight (I believe right under 3.5lbs). However, still packs a 13.5"" HD touchscreen display. And again, because no moving parts (or at least in partial contribution) the battery life on this unit is very strong.<br /><br />Microsoft claims 19hrs on a full charge. I haven't tested this boast end to end, but my tests have certainly surpassed any reasonable expectation for a laptop (8+ hrs straight & counting). As well, a &lt;2hr charge time is hard to beat.<br /><br />The display is beautiful. I don't like touch screens as I feel they introduce more problems than they solve. However, this is very responsive 2256 x 1504 pixel display. And because of that, colors are deep, accurate & the resolution works well with the 13.5"" screen ratio.<br /><br />I'm testing this unit as the center of a small guitar studio. It's running a couple of different DAW packages (Digital Audio Workstation software) as well as a copy of RockSmith 2014. There are also some external hardware components attached (a Scarlett Focusrite audio interface, USB mouse, multiport USB C dongle & an ABY pedal). So far, zero issues with detecting & using these devices.<br /><br />I've tested instrument audio across the built in speakers. And while it's nowhere near on par with a dedicated amp or monitor speakers, it will do just fine in a pinch (IE: messing around with Rocksmith). As a bump, Microsoft included Omnisonic Speakers & Dolby Atmos6 to its audio profile. For YouTube, listening to music, webcam stuff, etc... it will be great. However, I've yet to notice a huge difference compared to standard laptop speakers.<br /><br />And, as a Windows laptop, you can run Win 10 comfortably & without lag even with multiple apps churning at once.<br /><br />Of course, where would a review be without some cons. However, these cons may be enough to consider looking elsewhere for an ultra-portable laptop choice.<br /><br />First, the build quality. While the chassis is constructed entirely of aluminum (outside of the Alcantara keyboard pad that Microsoft just LOVES to pair with all of their Surface keyboards), the unit feels a little underwhelming in terms of strength. It may be partly (or mostly) due to the mushy, chiclet style keyboard. Typing on this thing feels just a little too bouncy for a $1300.00 laptop. However, it is backlit. But again, it is $1300.00!<br /><br />The proprietary Surface power supply connecter. If you've owned a Surface tablet, then this connector is awesome. As it has a magnet the allows you easily attach to the Surface power connector. Microsoft is using the same power adapter on its laptop models. However, the laptop is SO THIN that the power connecter (on the laptop) is so close to the base of the unit that you have to fiddle & fuss with it just to get it in place. If there was no magnet here, then forget ever getting it connected!<br /><br />Port selection is pitiful. I get going for a minimalist look & feel. But when doing so defeats the intended purpose of the product (in this case, a laptop that must remain functional, not just look cool), then we have an issue.<br /><br />There are only 3 ports on this thing. 1 USB A (3.0), 1 USB C & a headphone jack. MS could have easily added a second USB A (or even C). However, as with all Surface devices, you really need to invest in the ""rest of the Surface line"" to get the most of out their units.<br /><br />So things like the expansion hub, Surface Pen, etc.. And to really use this laptop, you need to get a dongle (like the Surface Hub) to expand your port selection, add a Ethernet port or add an HDMI port. And I get it, minimalism is in (TY for nothing, Apple). But again, not at the cost of function.<br /><br />As a side note, you DON'T need to purchase the MS versions of these accessories. There are plenty of cheaper, 3rd party alternatives that work just as well as the MS blessed models.<br /><br />There is NO UPGRADE PATH on these units. So, make sure to purchase the profile you need at time of purchase (IE: RAM, hard disk, etc..), because you can't upgrade down the road.<br /><br />Lastly, you will get a copy of Win 10 with your unit, but it will ship in useless, hobbled Windows S Mode. Getting out of this mode & opting for a full copy of Windows will be one of your first orders of business upon the initial setup. This is FREE & easily done using onscreen instructions.<br /><br />My contention here is that for $1300.00, you should get a full copy of Win 10 PRO. This unit ships with Win 10 HOME. A poor pairing in my opinion.<br /><br />So, these are my major pros & cons. This is a very sleek & minimalist laptop with a beautiful display that performs very well with incredible battery attributes (charging & holding charge). However, it also leaves you wanting more (but not wanting to spend more!). And, therefore, prompts for some further comparison shopping when you are out looking for your new ultra portable workhorse."
AELW7TMEO7INILU2GBIVI2CLGR3A,B08L5KHHWL,4,2,False,"I will spare all of the extra boring tech speak to avoid over complicating this review.<br /><br />The main reason someone would buy this IdeaPad with this particular configuration (Core i3 / 4GB RAM) is for basic tasks such as web browsing, watching movies or light office work.<br /><br />This is NOT a laptop designed for high end tasks like video editing, gaming, heavy photo editing, etc..<br /><br />Despite those limitations, you will still receive a compact Windows laptop (13"" long & under 3.5lbs) with full HD (1920x1080) touch screen, 4GB of RAM, an i3 Intel processor & a 128GB SSD drive.<br /><br />Oh, and it also doubles as a tablet!<br /><br />The tablet feature alone is what really sets this laptop apart from other entry level units (that aren't Chromebooks).<br /><br />To instantly activate tablet mode, you just fold the screen backwards until it rests on the bottom of the laptop.<br /><br />Once done, the laptop keyboard is disabled so you can hold the unit in landscape or portrait mode & use the laptop screen just as you would a tablet. When it comes time to type, a handy onscreen keyboard will automatically launch whenever a form or text field is detected.<br /><br />The screen is also viewable at all angles. Not something you see very often on entry level units. As well, there is also a built in webcam shutter so you can close off the cam when not in use.<br /><br />A few things to note to allow for a more positive experience:<br /><br />1) This laptop will arrive in WINDOWS 10 S MODE. This is a watered down version of Windows 10 designed for lower end (slower) systems. However, you can upgrade (for free & instantly) to Windows 10 Home. You really don't want to work in hobbled S MODE! Upgrading to Win 10 Home should be your first order or business.<br /><br />2) Install all Windows updates after converting out of S Mode. This will ensure your laptop is fully patched & stable.<br /><br />3) Don't use the laptop while you are running the above functions. It will be slow & choppy. Just do these maintenance tasks first. You will be much happier waiting & allowing them to complete!<br /><br />A few caveats:<br /><br />1) The cooling fan gets a bit loud at times. It's strange as why this unit gets so hot as it's all solid state. So I would take this as a premonition to prevent an overheating event. Therefore, MAKE SURE to use the laptop on a flat, hard, well ventilated surface (unless you're in tablet mode. Then you will be holding it). Don't plop it down & use for hours on a blanket or comforter!<br /><br />2) I saw a 5-6 hour battery life after a full charge. And this was running nothing but basic life support. So no big applications like Chrome, Netflix, etc.. So, under load, I would expect this battery to chew up pretty quick. Especially if the touchscreen is used a lot.<br /><br />3) No backlit keyboard & chiclet style keys stick every so often.<br /><br />4) Power button is in a weird spot - on the right side of the laptop. It's not obvious at first. And kind of cumbersome to work with.<br /><br />5) As with any device that encourages direct contact with the screen (IE: touch screens), you will always be at risk for screen damage (IE: pressing to hard). Unfortunately, this unit also requires one to fold the screen all the way back at a traditionally unorthodox angle to enter tablet mode. This opens up more potential for screen damage in the form of a cracked screen from too much bending or torquing the display when opening or closing. You also run the risk of connector damage (over time) at the hinge level.<br /><br />Even with the noted concerns, this is still a nice little laptop for the price (under $500). If you wanted to, you could bump it it to 16GB of RAM for about $80.00 more (installed yourself, not from Lenovo). Just adding the RAM upgrade would really expand the functionality - especially if you like to multi-task (or multi-TAB as in the case of Chrome users).<br /><br />And when compared to something like a Surface Go 2, this unit is way more cost effective (even taking into consideration the different processors on the Surface Go).<br /><br />Out of the box, you have a full HD Windows laptop AND Windows tablet that are ready to use.<br /><br />This is in comparison to the Surface Go 2. While starting at $400.00 may seem like a bargain, it requires many upgrades to render it a fully competent Windows laptop replacement."

But at least the JPEG creation on this camera is superior to the LX5 (the previous model). The LX5 JPEGs were really messy. These are cleaner.<br />Another quibble, although I appreciate the ability to adjust exposure compensation, the multipurpose dial and software implementation is a bit fiddly. I'd prefer a dedicated control for this.<br />The lens cap. It has a lens cap. Really annoying in a P&S. I keep forgetting to take it off, and I'll probably lose it eventually.<br />And a completely unreasonable quibble: no dedicated microphone jack. You won't be using this for commercial film production, despite the video quality. But almost no camera in this price range has a mic jack anyway.

Also, it says it is an outdoor camera but has an unsealed barrel plug that connects to an ungrounded wall plug. The bottom of the camera isn't completely sealed either so I would consider this to be an indoor camera for the most part unless it's in an enclosed porch. You will need to plug it in somewhere though so even that might be an issue.<br /><br />The picture quality is much better than expected and the motors are super smooth and almost silent.

The power supply really must be removed while installing the motherboard, unless the CPU and fan are already mounted. Even then, it's a hassle to plug everything else in, so I had to remove the power supply to finish. If the power supply was in the front or side, it would have been better. Also, if you have a large CPU fan, make sure to get a smaller one, because there's not much clearance between the fan and the power supply. My Intel Pentium 2 LGA 1155 Processor BX80637G2030 stock fan fit fine. These problems are to be expected with most MicroATX cases, so it's forgivable. I thought the power supply was dead at first, but the cord supplied was simply insanely loose, so I threw it out and used another power cord. I think that might account for a good number of the dead power supplies reviewers mention. The case comes with drive trays to mount 3.5&#34; hard drive sideways in the case, which is nice, but the rails are hard plastic and cause a _lot_ of noise transmission from the hard drive, so I simply mounted the drive in the floppy drive spot until I get an SSD."

Beginning with these, I had also wanted to be able to migrate to the home theatre / TV PC environment. As you can see in the promotion, the Asus interface has an HDMI & DVI connector on the board and the card will produce 7.1 sound through the HDMI connection. It will permit a connection to a TV simultaneously with a DVI monitor.<br /><br />In the meantime, having switched to Windows 7 64-bit, I wanted to move ahead to a more powerful fan-less card with the same thing in mind.

I would guess this probably reaches a gaming threshold for some. There seem to be dozens of games supported, but I am ignorant of that entire side of the industry and what is or is not popular.<br /><br />I was an easy install on Windows 7 64-bit. It's Plug and Play for generic VGA drivers, although you really want to use the nVidia GeForce stuff ideally with a DVI monitor (if possible).

We often went on coffee breaks waiting for programs to load.  We all knew that computers would be faster some day but I don't think any of envisioned something like the Samsung 850 EVO 250 GB M.2 SSD.  This drive is really sensational.  Certainly beats the 8&#34; floppies we once used!  I was lucky when I selected a Gigabyte GA-Z97X-UD3H (Rev 1.2) motherboard as it comes with the pesky screw pre-installed to hold the drive in place.  For those of you who are planning on purchasing this drive, it shouldn't be too hard to find the screw.  Ace Hardware, if there is one near you, usually has a good selection of metric screws.  If not, one of the big box stores often have the right size.  It shouldn't be too hard to find locally.  Installing the drive couldn't be much easier.  Just slip it into place and replace the screw.  These are small screws so don't over tighten it.  I was using this drive in a new build with the above mentioned motherboard (and I really like it), an Intel i7 4790k processor, and 32 GB of RAM.  I also have two 1 TB Western Digital drive in raid for data storage (the SSD is only for the OS and programs that must be installed on the C: drive.  When I build a new system or replace a boot drive I always rebuild the system.  Migrating the system often brings along obsolete software or drivers that can eventually cause problems. I also have a WD 4 TB drive for long term data storage.  I'm not telling you about the hardware to brag, it is just to give you an idea of the components working with the 850.  I am using Windows 7 Ultimate and the system boots almost instantly.  A friend timed it at 7 seconds.  Takes me much longer to type in my 21 character password (I'm not paranoid, I just like long passwords) than it takes the system to boot.  This drive is silent, doesn't vibrate, runs cool, and is just schmookin' fast.  Saving data happens faster than it takes to press the &#34;Save&#34; icon.<br /><br />I use Linux Mint 17.3 on my other computers but I have to use Windows on this one because it is in my ham shack as the majority of ham software is written for Windows.  Unfortunately, my ham shack is in my garage, and being in northern California, the summer temps can be in the mid 90's in the garage.  My processor is water cooled and I also have several case fans and a memory fan.  This little drive stays right at room temp and never slows down.

The newer Model 68332 is upgraded but similar to it's older model 67139 NO PROBLEMS TODAY.. ZERO! My pictures are always 100% sharp during the day, almost in HD color. At night cameras illuminate front & rear yard up to about 10' to 15' enough to ID someone at that range but still have enough visibility to notice a prowler approaching in the dark two blocks away in black and white on my 60"" flat screen. I have manipulated the weak LED bulbs in my cameras by purchasing a ""IR ILLUMINATOR"" from AMAZON. They come in many sizes depending on the amount of area you want to cover with a powerful infrared lighting. YouTube carries a very good demo of a ""SL1080-HIGH POWER INTELLIGENT IR ILLUMINATOR"". It is very illuminating in pitch darkness up to 300 meters and has a 60degree wide span of coverage or you can surf Amazon inventory and decide what suits you. Just be sure to check owners manual on camera ""WAVE LENGHT & VISIBILITY"" or call Bunker Hill 1-888-866-5797 and find out what IR ILLUMINATOR is best for you. Your going to have to purchase either a 850nm (NANO METER) or 950nm (NANO METER), one of the difference is the 850nm offers a slight reddish glow at night from its LED bulbs that can be seen... But the 950nm offers total invisibility and CAN'T BE SEEN by the naked eye for stealth, secrecy, or detecting unit at night...

(CONS)  Remote works but sometimes you have to press buttons repeatedly to get working so I use buttons on DVR to pause, fast forward ect, works 100% better. Cameras are weather proof but sometimes moisture and condensation can build up inside housing lens obscuring video.. I solved problem permanently by purchasing a tube of ""SEAL ALL SILICONE"" at HOME DEPOT $5.BUCKS and with the tip of my finger spread silicone just enough among each seam and crevices on each camera to keep out any rain moisture. Not all cameras have moisture issues but I added extra silicone to protect  all my cameras in case there is a possibility of any rain water seeping in... The camera arm is very flexible when positioning cameras but does at times become to loose making camera its self to flop around loosing its original position.. Issue can be solved by first positioning camera into its desired position, then placing gorilla tape on camera housing,then to exterior wall or it's screw base temporarily to keep from moving out of place once positioned, then apply ""Seal All silicone"" to arm joints liberally and let sit for 5hrs or over night... Will hold through heat and cold, just don't get silicone on lens glass...

I wanted to get that out of the way in the beginning. The board itsself functions great. I was worried with all of the coverings to make the motherboard look nice that the cooling would suffer. Thankfully NZXT beefed up the heatsinks on the VRM's and the SSD covers. The board also offers USB BIOS Flashback, on board power button (so no bridging the connectors with a screwdriver), reset and CMOS clear switches. The N7 has a 12+1 DrMOS power phase system to provide plenty of stability while overclocking. The Bios is also well thought out and intuitive. The board is made in partnership with Asrock and they also supply the Bios.

AHMXWJZBONT436BJO65PRS5HLOYQ,B01HD6ZLQ6,5,5,True,"I purchased 8TB drive 14 months ago for purpose of it being attached to NAS for a differential backups.<br />NAS recognized it in a breeze, only issue NAS has is that it can not let the drive into sleep mode.<br />I realized this after two months of continuous run on this poor desktop aimed harddrive inside its neat piano black enclosure with convenience of expanding your USB3.0 ports to additional two. Fortunately, the constant strain onto this non-workstation drive havent had any impacts whatsoever. It remains to be superbly quiet while being amazingly fast with a limit of 151MB/s I have noticed on desktop while backing up from local SSDs. May not seem too impressive compared to SATA3 speed limits or SSD drives speeds but considering its a single HDD with its capacity platters and quietness, this is rather impressive, especially comparing my old 1TB usb2.0 Drive which is slower than one 6th of this drives performance. Spin-up is lengthy but the drive supports sleep mode while a source its plugged into via USB cable is turned off and I would say power on spin up time sacrifice is a great feature vs shorter drive life. Once its booted its access time is snappy, may take couple of seconds at most but then again, this is a mechanical drive which does well also in this regard.<br />Best feature is the front USB HUB, and If I knew I will once buy this drive, I would save 30 bucks by skipping the purchase of 4 port USB3.0 hub that also needs power adapter. This drives front hub suffices my needs for USB3.0 ports by itself and places them right where I need it to be next to external optical drive and a card reader separated from the desktop case into a furniture piece with opening for what I call a media peripherals cabinet, it is very convenient just for this matter itself as I hide the wiring clutter in the back of it and all looks neat and tidy.<br />If you keep the drive exposed, you may also like the breathing style logo LED backlight while its at works. When in standby, it just stays lit and isnt intrusively bright.<br />Software-wise, the drive comes pre-loaded with a small application that will forward your web browser to seagate web site regarded to registration of particular product that could be skipped and still provided you with utilities: Toolkit - free of charge for your desktop backups being done once, daily, weekly, monthly, atm or differential backup.<br />RescueData - could be downloaded for a charge and sadly, this utility is not free.<br />Theres a fame that Seagate drives are defective and dont last long, yet I have never had an issue with Maxtor nor Seagate drives since late 90's. Actually It was Western Digital that gave me issues on three different drives. I have 2 seagate IronWolf drives in NAS and are running 24/7 and report healthy with 0 errors for the past year and a half or so.<br />I strongly advise you, dont give on others reviews bashing this brand, seagate honors warranties and wont try to steal your money as some state. This honest company does not need to damage its name.<br />In pc world its just fan war between the brands just like consoles flame wars go about PS vs Xbox, so do the PC spheres go Intel vs AMD, Nvidia vs AMD, Seagate vs WD where in reality, all the products perform about the same and only winner is who throws a better competing price tag onto their product. You are not getting damaged, or 50% less performing product, those who try to tell you that, are completely out of the picture. I dont even believe their said experience with DOA drives, unless they play football with them, place them next to 300WATT speakers magnets, plug and unplug usb or power cord while the drive is being accessed at the very moment pretending its hot-swappable and expect everything to be fine. Of course it wont, nor would it be okay with any brand HDD or SSD.<br /><br />NOTE! 8TB drive, as of Feb. 2020 has a wrong price. Its only 50cents cheaper than 10TB version, whilst I purchased this over a year ago for 149.99 - this needs a FIX do not buy 8TB Drive for more than US$150!<br /><br />UPDATE: Soon it'll be 4 years of daily use with backups set once a week, rather occasional write of random files ranging from single kB up to well over a GB, numerous daily accesses. Still snappy & quiet, performs just like on Day 1 and as excpected, CHKDSK report in provided screenshot confirmed theres 0 bad sectors. What more to state than this drive is phenomenal? Only that I truly feel sorry for unhappy owners of this flawless drive. Since my purchase in Dec of '18 price went up 22 dollars and STILL holds lowest price tag for 8TB external drive with added bonus in form of USB hub other brand drives lack, just cant beat it for the price and considering purchase of another one."

AHCLVJWUA4O6BWTQTEAR4YI72SKQ,B00COQ4ETG,4,6,True,"I read all the reviews here before buying this computer.  This is all the upgrades I did to make it the best computer I ever had.<br /><br />1.) Network Card - the ASUS one gave me only 3 bars in the room of the house that I enjoy.  My work laptop (Leveno X220) was much better. This ( Intel 7260HMW IEEE 802.11ac Mini PCI Express Bluetooth 4.0 - Wi-Fi/Bluetooth Combo Adapter ) card fixed things... though like others write, the bluetooth doesn't work.  I am still downloading drivers trying to fix it.  If anyone comes up with a solution, let me know. Cost: $30<br /><br />Installing the card is easy - pop the cover - search around for a similar card and replace it.  It is in plain view with two wires connecting the card.<br /><br />2.) Upgrade the memory to 16M.  I do photo stitching which takes up tons of memory... and I used (Kingston Technology HyperX Plug n Play 16 GB Kit (2x8 GB) 1600MHz DDR3 PC3-12800 Non-ECC CL9 SODIMM 1.35V Notebook Memory KHX16LS9P1K2/16) memory.  Installing was also easy if you are careful.  Anyone need 8 gigs of memory? Cost: $175<br /><br />3) Replace the slow hard drive with a SSD - mine is (Samsung Electronics 840 EVO-Series 250GB 2.5-Inch SATA III Single Unit Version Internal Solid State Drive MZ-7TE250BW) Cost: $150  This by far is the best upgrade for speed!  The drive comes with software (good software that is easy to use) to migrate your OS from the slow hard drive to the SSD - and very nice directions.  (I like Samsung so much I was tempted to buy their computer - but I like ASUS.)<br /><br />4.) Get a caddy to replace the cd-rom.  Anyone need a cd rom?  Cost:  $12  (NEW SATA 2nd HDD caddy for 9.5mm Universal CD/DVD-ROM ACER BENQ HP DELL ASUS)  You will need to take the bezel off the cd-rom and pop it on your caddy so your ASUS  keeps the case looking like it has a CD.  You can see a multitude of videos on putting the caddy & HDD into your computer... it is easy.  Be sure to completely put it all in or the HDD will not work... i.e. all the screws straps and such.<br /><br />5.) You need a set of tools to take the back off.  Cost: $7 (Tool Repair Kit Precision Screw Driver Set Torx + Flat Head + Safe Plying Prying Pry Tool for Motorola Verizon Sprint ATT Cingular Razor and More)  It was a quality kit - but  I marked my 5 size with a sharpie because they all look a like to me... unless you have good eyes to see the sizes stamped on the shank of the drivers.<br /><br />6.) Last, I got a case or the thing because it's cheap and stuff in my backpack gets messed up easily.  This case fits like a glove and is very nice. (AmazonBasics 15 to 15.6-inch Laptop Sleeve) Cost: $12.<br /><br />What do I like about the laptop that makes it the best laptop ever?<br /><br />* The keyboard is so nice, I will not buy a wireless keyboard for it as I do all my laptops.  (I like the feel)<br />* The display is crisp and beautiful.  The crispness is enough that I am not saying, &#34;Awe!  It's so damn small!!&#34;<br />* The speakers are good enough for listening to music - kind of like a mid-range cheap radio.  Clear but you are no going to crank it up and have a dance party.  I like them.<br />* It is super fast on boot - processing - internet.<br />* USB3.0 is very nice!<br />* I hardly use the touch screen.<br /><br />Downside?<br /><br />* It's big and heavy... but I'm not taking it backpacking and I'm not the type that hangs out in public places with my computer.<br />*The bluetooth isn't working because of that damn Intel card<br />* Windows 8.1 is annoying - but I'm learning to get around the things that annoy me ( the &#34;charms&#34; and Microsoft trying to force you to use their products)  I think complaints against Windows 8 is over-rated and from people too lazy to figure out how to navigate around the &#34;training wheels&#34; and marketing efforts of Microsoft."

AFOSX4RJNLXRE5ZJHM6KWPWHKC6Q,B002RL8TFS,4,6,True,"I don't know how many Bluetooth headsets I've burned through over the years, but this is unequivocally the best I've tried. Why? It's not the sound - good, but still not up to the ultimate benchmark set in the old days by Ma Bell's landlines. No, it's the intelligent on/off design.<br /><br />I hate walking around or sitting in meetings with a Bluetooth on, so it's generally in my pocket. When the phone rings, I want whatever I pick up first - the cell or the Bluetooth - to work. With other headsets I've owned, if I pick up the phone first, sometimes there is no sound because it has already switched to Bluetooth, or worse, goes dead during the conversation when it connects to the headset - so then I'm fumbling to get the headset on.<br /><br />Brilliantly, the H17 is off when it's off and on when it's on, and the difference between the two is physically obvious. If I pick up the cell first, I can talk while I dig out the headset, fit it on my ear, and flip it to on. The connection is fast and seamless. It can connect in mid-sentence and no one knows the difference. Conversely, if I answer with the headset, the connection is immediate.<br /><br />The H17 can pair with 2 devices, so when I'm at my computer, I can handle calls on my cell or Skype without switching headsets. Again, easy and brilliant.<br /><br />Other reviewers have said H17s break easily. That hasn't been my experience yet, but at these prices, I will gladly replace it. I'm ordering one for my tech-challenged wife today, and I'm confident she will have no problem with it."

The price was right on this and I have given it a try.  Drivers can be a little bit of extra effort to get installed, but not hard.  After a number of months of use, I have been very happy with the computer and have no complaints.  I will likely look at this brand again for my next computer purchase."

I've used these almost daily for a couple months and have been very pleased.<br /><br />The bass is rich, the separation reasonable and the treble bright without being shrill.  With some music, the bass was a little heavy, but that was easily resolved with a minor EQ adjustment. The sound is way better than you would expect at this low price.<br /><br />Phone calls are pretty good. If you hold the mic up a little bit, the sound quality is great. If you let the mic dangle, it sounds similar to a conference room speaker phone - decent and intelligible, but not great. Of course, &#34;conference room speaker phone&#34; quality is totally acceptable in professional environments, so these earbuds will actually meet the expectations of the people you're talking to.<br /><br />The fit is good.

But no, the 10"" tablet USB micro B connector went really bad long before it should have. So I bought another one! Even though we all know planned obsolescence is a poor reason to buy anything.)<br /><br />I got extremely rare good luck: I got an intelligent technician who witnessed by screen-sharing how both tablets worked.<br />(Most of the time you will get someone to whom you describe the settings you changed and how they performed, who says, ""Now go up to the top right corner where it says ""Sign In"".)<br /><br />(1)<br />a) I like to use landscape mode. On my old tablet, when an app works only in portrait mode opened, as soon as I closed that app, my entire tablet went back to landscape mode, just the way I had set it.<br />b) On my new tablet, when I opened an app that used only portrait mode, when I closed it, my entire tablet's settings were hijacked and set into portrait mode.<br />I had to set it, cycling through, to ""auto-rotate"", then to ""landscape"". . . Every. Single. Time.<br />If you have my usual luck, you will reach a technician who just thinks you aren't bright enough to set your own settings. I got lucky and the good tech witnessed the hijacking of my settings.

Of *course* I was able to choose which address, which payment method, which delivery window I wanted each time.<br />b) The new tablet app wouldn't let me choose payment method or delivery speed. You could poke holes in the screen jabbing at it, to no avail.<br /><br />(3) For an 8"" Plus, with 3Gb memory instead of my old 2 Gb, it was awfully slow. I have never watched a tablet wake up and show only the titles of all the icons on the home page, and mosey around taking its good old time waking up before the icons themselves showed up. It was slow in other ways too.<br /><br />(4) I had a micro SD card in my old Fire the whole time. I didn't save all those files just to have them locked away from me forever. I put the card in my new 8 Plus, and that thing wanted to format it!

And I also know how good it is to find someone who doesn’t assume that you don't know how to use your own settings.<br /><br />But after they got back to me (I told you it was good service) and said that ""Software engineering is working on it"", hoo boy. I knew it wasn't going to be another few days, and someone would just flip an account setting switch and voila! all better now.<br />I knew I was in it for the long haul.<br /><br />At that point, it was ""I'm returning this, and I'll come back when the New And Improved Kindle Fire doesn't work far worse than my old Kindle Fire.""<br />It's supposed to be, you know, better.<br /><br />But this could take a while.

If you're upgrading or have less modest needs, you may want to look elsewhere.  Everything I just said would apply to any 128gb NVMe drive.  For all of the performance provided by a SSD not encumbered by SATA, NVMe drives can be a pain to replace down the line.  Some can be attributed to various EFI implementations that reside on the outgoing drive (thus leading to issues booting to Windows on a new drive), while others are due to limited (though much better lately) support for NVMe drives via USB (to clone your old system).  In either event, it's not worth the trouble upgrading to this (due to the 128gb size).<br /><br />Anyway, there's not much to say specific to this drive.  It's a reliable though unremarkable SSD.  It works, but it's no better than any other NVMe SSD, and all are great for most people.  Compared to my lower end (QLC) Intel drives, this is the same speed at a higher cost per GB.  Compared to my faster Samsung drives, this is cheaper but slower.  In real world use, all feel the same!<br /><br />Anyway, this is a reliable though unremarkable drive.  It shares the performance of most NVMe drives, and falls behind the best of the best.  Likewise it's overall experience is the same with any NVMe drive.  They can be a bit problematic when cloning your old drive on a laptop (you likely only have one M.2 slot), and even on a desktop, various EFI setups may get wrecked when swapping drives--thus I recommend this and others only for new builds."

These ports on the board are the mini SAS style connectors, and the SSD has the usual drive connector.  Power makes it to this connector via a tail to add SATA power.  The rest was simple plug and play.  The drive I bought was cheaper than any M.2 drives, includes a built in heat sink, and this cable let me use an otherwise unneeded port in my mobo.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you need a consumer mobo to U.2 drive cable."

Most are rather reliable, and the odd firmware issues of the past are all but gone.  There are equally fast and reliable SSDs for less.  Many are half the price of this drive or even less.  So unless you're looking for the style provided by the LEDs, you can do better with anything from PNY, Sandisk, Samsung, Intel, etc...<br /><br />So the LEDs ...  You need a supported (pretty much all are) motherboard.  You also need a case that makes the whole affair worthwhile (ie one with a visible SSD), which is a bigger issue.  Most cases either put SSDs in a cage or behind the motherboard and hidden by a solid panel.  I don't imagine that will change anytime soon.  To be honest, this issue all but makes this drive a niche product.  Kudos for supporting various motherboards and standard headers, but none of my cases (I have 6!) showcase a 2.5 drive.

Intel Optane (a completely different class of drive) and Samsung 960pro drives will beat these, and depending on the benchmark, as will some others, but in real world use, you're well into the crazy fast realm.  That's what this drive is all about--getting into the crazy fast realm without breaking the bank!<br /><br />In general, you will notice a speed difference between this and a SATA SSD, especially when launching huge applications/data sets (think Premier Pro, games, especially with 4k textures, and even Windows booting up).  Most won't notice the difference between this and a Samsung 960pro (an Optane drive is a whole new level of fast).  It was easy enough to setup, but YMMV.  Due to the fact that this drive isn't SATA, you cannot slap it in a USB 3.1 enclosure, or even a 2.5&#34; drive adapter.  It will fit in a PCIe x4 card (not included), but otherwise, you'll have to do some juggling, especially if going from one NVMe drive to another in a PC with only one slot.<br /><br />Intel and Toshiba drives have had some issues with newer Windows 10 builds (being fixed), and Samsung drives cost more, so this is a solid option for folks looking for NVMe performance without breaking the bank.  250GB is enough for many folks (especially if media on another drive, NAS, or the cloud), and 500GB gives you even more space.

It seemed an odd decision (especially given the comparable price) at first, and my opinion has only gotten worse.<br /><br />The box is slim though nondescript (though my employer may just get whole pallets of these in oem boxes), and the instructions were limited to a single card.  The appropriate power tip was included and the power provided seems to meet the needs of my T460 just fine (7th gen CPU no GPU).  While there was a need for a driver, it installed fine without admin access on my machine.  After a root and plugging in two cables, I was up and running.  Well I was running, but my system was walking and tripping.<br /><br />The added screens work, but the VGA out is fuzzier than usual, both external screens chugged at times and have issues with apps like SnagIt, and occasionally everything dies.  Yup.  My work PC becomes a bit of a paperweight while I unplug the dock and plug back in.  Then the whole slow process of getting everything up and running starts again, and since the dock handles ethernet and audio in/out, my Skype meetings just die.<br /><br />To be fair it works most of the time, though you may need to ignore the sluggish cursor and inability to use some tools like SnagIt.  The times it totally dies are unacceptable, and the price doesn't compare to a dedicated dock (not all models offer them, but at least for me its the natural comparison).<br /><br />Do note that a dedicated hardware dock redirects inputs and outputs from your laptops components, thus leverages what should be top notch iGPU, Intel NIC, decent audio, ect...

The chip is a mainline desktop part (albeit a special costlier low power version) as opposed to a laptop part, which gives it added oomph, though it likely doesn't need it (most Intel laptop parts are plenty fast enough in their own right).  It does give this PC legs for whats to come in the years ahead with four legit cores and highly competent iGPU (especially for media).  We use it as a stationary complement to our house full of laptops and tablets, and as they're all on Windows 10 (save for a Chromebook), it's all familiar.  If you're new to Windows 10--no worries, as it's rather mature and easy to use.<br /><br />Bonus points for better than expected audio and a screen that places image quality (wide angle IPS) over resolution (it does fall short of an iMac that offers both).  The large hard drive, ample RAM, and ability to add a SSD (I may be optimistic, but it appears that one is available on other models in series, so I assume one could be added--if nothing else, in lieu of that DVD drive I'll never use) are all also nice bonuses.  The lackluster webcam is an odd miss, especially for my uses.  Moving forward as MS adds more Alexa features to Cortana, a solid mic and camera are crucial to Windows 10 AIO devices.

This bad boy comes in faster than the 600p  and slower than the Evo, but the differences only come in heavy workload with deep queues. In practice, all NVMe drives (even the 600p) will do well in lighter workloads.  This compares well with the RD400 in regards to price, and depending on deals, appears to be a good value compared to the 600p (slightly higher perf for slightly higher cost).  Then again the Evo is much better (at extreme workloads) and represents a no compromise solution (despite the 960 pro being even faster)  and the RD400 is noticeably (though again all are very fast) faster reads/rights and has the advance warranty (immediate replacement sent without charging your card).<br /><br />In the end, if you want the best get the 960 Evo or even Pro, but after that, this makes a solid value, and when/if marked down, it can be a great value.  Depending on how planer vs 3d NAND prices go and TLC vs MLC, you could see deals on these, and ultimately this is plenty good enough for all but the most demanding needs.

There's no easy way to turn this into an external device, so you'll want to put a sata m2 ssd in a m2 to usb enclosure, put this in its place, and clone it (I used clonezilla). Of course replacing a smaller m2 nvme drive creates its own challenges. Desktop users can leverage a free pcie slot, provided you have a basic adapter.<br />Anyway, this drive is among the best out there in terms of speed, support, warranty, etc... I'd recommend for new builds and with the caveats of some additional challenges, upgraders too."

Yeah it has six corse, and yes 6 &#62; 4, but that's only part of the magic.  Cache can play a huge role in some tasks, and this has that in spades, but to me the biggest benefit comes from the overall x99 platform.  That's built from the ground up for bandwidth and compute performance.  You get 40 lanes (this isn't limited to 24 like the 5820k or 16 like Haswell) of PCIe, which means you can run a could 16x video cards in sli AND have plenty of lanes left of PCIe NVMe SSDs or whatever.  Oh the chipset has a few lanes of it's own (granted PCIe 2.0), so yeah it's got the juice.  Like it offers quad channel DDR4, which while initially expensive and a bit slow on latencies, now has gotten much better in both regards (also remember to compare latencies in absolute time not clock cycles).  Oh you still get 6 cores, 12 threads, and it's unlocked.  Out of the box you're down a bit vs Haswell or Skylake i7s in single thread performance, but these CPUs have some headroom (they have old school solder under the lid, not the less efficient stuff other recent Intel CPUs have).  4.2ghz should be doable without much effort for all cores, and I didn't have any issues pushing that to 4.4ghz.  Even at stock speeds, you should be chugging along with any threaded workload.<br /><br />Sadly, I would recommend this for novices.  It's a server derived part that tends to use more complicated boards, bioses, etc...  Support is also a bit lacking vs Z97 or Z170 boards as well.  Don't let that scare you if you've built a PC or two however.  What can scare you is the price (don't forget that X99 boards and four channel DDR4 kits are also sold at a premium), which frankly makes this hard to recommend for most folks.  There's a ton of transistors and a lot of engineering in these chips, and the whole platform is amazing.  I'm delighted I have this system, but without using SLI, you'd be better off with a Devil's Canyon or 6700k.<br /><br />The Bugatti Veyron (not quite the Veyron Super Sport) of CPUs.

AECTQQX663PTF5UQ2RA5TUL3BXVQ,B00BKV3BQ8,5,0,True,"I had an extra Ivy Bridge i3 from an old server I upgraded to a cheap i7.  At first I was just going to sit on because spending a few hundred dollars on a mb, case, etc... didn't seem worth it (vs a new Skylake build), but then I found this as a refurb.  For the price of a case, I got a case, power supply and board, and it was tiny (basically the size of an mini-ITX board) to boot. I'm usually all about refurbs, but Intel boards scare me with their pin filled sockets and careless damage to them.  This was the best refurb I ever received.<br /><br />The packaging was the retail packaging, complete with a handle and various model info that was clear to read.  At first I figured I got a new setup (some manufacturers dump excess product as refurb or grey market), as outwardly all that indicated refurb was a handsome sticker saying that Shuttle refurbished it.  Opening it up presented the usual accouterments with no compromises, and the unit was enclosed not in a plastic bag but rather some cloth bag ala a Kate Spade purse.  That bag had the first of a couple large bags of desiccant (gotta keep it all dry). Removing it from that bag revealed a modest scuff on the case, but otherwise it was immaculate.  The top removed with semi captive thumbscrews and a decent tug was needed to free it.  Inside everything was wrapped nicely.  The layout of the board is straightforward, and there is a 1x (or is it 4x) PCI Express slot (no space for backplate), which I may be able to cram a PCI SSD in if I really wanted to--I don't).  All of the connections to the case are in place and secure, and the heat pipe was relatively easy to remove.  If it weren't for some scuffs on the underside of the heat pipe, I would have guessed this was a flood model never equipped with a CPU.  While the base of heat pipe itself seemed lacking by enthusiast standards (not entirely smooth and of modest materials), it covered an immaculate socket 1155 with a plastic cover.  I slipped the RAM and mSATA SSD in before proceeding, but adding the CPU and locking it in place was a breeze.  The heat pipe was a bit difficult to fully seat, as one of the push pins wouldn't go in all the way (**be sure that the pins go in all the way--otherwise the CPU may overheat**).  That's more of a fault of the industry wide design than anything that was Shuttle's fault.<br /><br />While I put an SSD inside, I first tried it with OpenELEC (Linux based media center) on a thumb drive.  It installed quickly and easily, and I must say that the BIOS on this board is one of the best for this use.  It used to be a given that you can set your boot order however, making a boot disk (back in the day a floppy, later a CD, and nowadays a USB stick) easy as pie.  Ever since UEFI/EFI etc... some boards (the latest NUCs are the worst) make it hard to boot to usb drives.  This one made old school and UEFI USB drives a breeze.  I've never seen so many boot options.  Kudos!  The rest of the BIOS is a bit basic, but I'm not exactly gonna overclock this.  Afterwards Windows 8.1 installed easily, though the drivers were a pain to download (think their FTP server was busy).  A thumb drive would have been great (a CD was included, and the unit can accommodate a drive).<br /><br />A couple other things:  the fans are small but quiet.  You can really fit a couple drives in there (I elected to use mSATA and take out the drive brackets).  The front cover for the USB and audio ports can close over a Logitech unifying receiver (small win).  Since all of the airflow goes out the side, you can slide it all the way back in a cabinet (provided ample room on the sides).<br /><br />From time to time I get good deals on CPUs, and I may go this route the next time I do.  It's not quite as small as a NUC, but you have more CPU options without using that much more space.  It's so tiny!"

That's a bit of a simplification, as the power circuitry and other factors played a role, but that put me over the top.  The board comes in a modest box (a bit refreshing from the usual garishly large boxes), and it's accompanied only by the essentials.  WiFi antenna, WiFi leads, a couple SATA cables, IO shield, front panel adapter, and manuals/discs.  The WiFi leads are annoying, as I cannot fathom why they aren't in place already.  My Gigabyte board had these installed and on the IO panel, but ASRock and Asus insists on you installing them.  I'm guessing it's a FCC thing (perhaps they'd need to validate the board as opposed to relying on the FCC approved parts and having you put them together), but it's a pain (those tiny antenna leads are a chore to snap in place and then you have to thread the posts in).  I almost deducted a point for this.  Perhaps a saving grace is the front panel adapter, which makes it easier to connect the power and reset (not that my case had a switch) buttons and various LEDs.  The rest assembles easy enough, though being an ITX board, it's a tight fit.  Do note that the m.2 slot is on the rear of the board.

The three fan headers are easy to control via the included software.

There are simple toggles and buttons to automate things, though perhaps some on demand explanation of what;s going on would help.  If nothing else enabling multicore enhancement allows all cores to peak at the speed that one core used to peak at.<br /><br />Supposedly Asus has done extensive validation and testing with this board, and through it all, I've never had a crash, blue screen, error, or any other issue.

AECTQQX663PTF5UQ2RA5TUL3BXVQ,B002HWRJBM,4,0,True,"**5/2015 Update<br />OK, battery life is not decent (as stated in my original review).  Even putting a newish (and freshly refreshed on my Maha charger) Eneloop in there, the battery life is 1.5 weeks at work.  Different batteries--same result.  Not good.  The mouse has held up well otherwise, though I wish it had more buttons and the side scrolling is all but useless.  It feels great and the pointer has been spot on.  I'd still give ity 4 stars, but now just barely and largely based on the ergonomics (save for nearly useless side scrolling).<br /><br />**Original review<br />I disdain laptop track pads, and when I'm not using a Thinkpad (I actually like the red stick), I usually reach for a mouse.  In a perfect world Bluetooth would be ubiquitous, reliable, and have instant on performance.  Sadly it's not that way, so we're stuck with little dongles or nubbins.  Here the nubbin is small, and better yet will work with other Logitech goodies, which I don't need, but I suppose it's nice.  Sadly it's still prone to snag on snug bags (especially on widescreen laptops such as my [[ASIN:B004RCUIJU HP ProBook 4530s XU015UT 15.6&#34; LED Notebook (2.1 GHz Intel Core i3-2310M Dual-Core Processor, 4 GB RAM, 320 GB Hard Drive, DVD+/-RW SuperMulti DL LightScribe, Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit)]].  This combined with the hectic pace of laptop removal at TSA security checkpoints saw my nubbin break in two :-(  I don't blame Logitech, but it does make the notion of keeping it in all the time subject to a more generous bag situation.  Fortunately, humpty dumpty was put back together again, and all works fine.<br /><br />The ergonomics are mostly good, but the forward/back buttons are too close to the zoom button, and I don't really use the zoom much anyway.  It's mostly programmable, and I like the click wheel toggle for smooth or notched experiences when scrolling.  The rechargeable nature is a plus, as is the lack of a charging base (from my vantage point as a laptop user who wouldn't have a place for one).  The standard micro USB makes life easy, as I can add another charger to my arsenal when I'm not recharging the mouse.  Battery life is decent, and you should be able to replace the included rechargeable AA batteries with something better, such as [[ASIN:B004UG41XW Sanyo NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries]].<br /><br />All in all a very good mouse.

I went ahead and replaced it with the top-rated current Logitech model, which I've found to be far less ergonomic and comfortable than my trusty Intellimouse. Maybe a few more days and I'll forget about the Intellimouse. Maybe...<br /><br />It's been a great run. 20 years is a lot longer than I think I ever could have expected that mouse to last, and I seriously doubt this Logitech one is going to give me even half of that.<br /><br />So rest well in peripheral heaven (also known as a corner of my basement), little mouse. You were truly awesome. Doomscrolling will never again be quite the same."

AFGI5XVA5EBVOE2EOS42KHQSULXA,B00Z14VC7K,5,4,False,"I've had mine for several weeks now and couldn't be more impressed. As a composer my studio setup calls for the use of large sample libraries, for example EastWest Symphony and Choirs alone take up more than 250 GB.  My base setup is an iMac with a 4Ghz i7 processor and 32 GB of ram. It has an internal 1 TB SSD which holds  the OS, programs and working files, an external Thunderbolt 2- RAID O for samples and some working data and a RAID 1 for backup purposes. The two raids total 12 TB. There's also a 2 TB usb 3 drive for itunes files.<br /><br />I bought the Glyph Atom Raid (which can only be used in RAID O mode) because my existing Thunderbolt RAID O HDD unit, a LaCie, was simply too slow to handle the larger projects I'm working on. Even though my current Mac doesn't support USB 3.1, I hoped that the Glyphs RAID O SSD operating through the supplied supplied 3.1 to 3.0 cable would be fast enough to overcome the problems I was having using complex symphonic templates that called for accessing hundreds of sample files (a complete symphony orchestra uses roughly 80 to 90 instruments -- each needing multiple samples forming different articulations or styles of playing). As I plan to upgrade to a new computer that does support USB 3.1/Thunderbolt 3, I knew that the Glyph Atom would eventually be useful, even if it was no faster than my current HDD RAIDs. Thunderbolt 2 SSD RAIDs remain, for some reasons, outrageously expensive, so that option was out. If this didn't work my only other option would be to buy a second computer just to run the samples. Even buying used equipment, that plus the extra music networking software and cables would easily cost 3 or 4 times as much as the Atom Raid, plus many hours getting it set up. It's a task I'm going to have to take on eventually, but thanks to the Glyph, not yet.<br /><br />The bottom line: It works. The Glyph Atom Raid 1TB is literally 50 to 75% faster than any other RAID on my system as measured by Xbench. Using Black Magic- which measures using much larger data pieces - more a concern to film editors than musicians - the differences were a speed increase of 40 to 60 percent. Of course it's still slower than the internal SSD, but it's fast enough that I no longer suffer the problems associated with lack of fast access when playing large scores through Notion, Studio One or Sibelius, i.e. drop outs, distortions or crackling.<br /><br />So, bravo Glyph! You saved me money and time by putting out a well designed, very fast product. As a manufacturer you folks have a great reputation among musicians. With the Atom Raid it seems well deserved. My only criticism is that the supplied cables are very short. When connected to the port on my 27"" iMac one end of the unit is lifted off the table by cable. I've put a book under it until a 1 ft. long cable arrives. Always use as short a cable as is practical when connecting USB drives - distance reduces speed.<br /><br />To potential purchasers I should mention that Glyph packages the drive very well. In addition to the rubber bumpers that the unit is equipped with, it's packed nestled in a cutout in high density foam within a heavy pasteboard box.  The two cables come in a second compartment under the drive, giving another layer of protection. Amazon put this in their own carelessly packed box wrapped a single sheet of bubble wrap. By the time the unit arrived, the bubble wrap had come undone (it was not taped) and was wadded in one corner of the box.<br /><br />2 YEAR FOLLOW UP!<br /><br />It's now more than two years since I purchased this drive and I remain convinced that it's one of my best computer related investments. My principal studio computer is now an iMac Pro - 3 GHz 10 core Intel Xeon W with 64GB of DDR4 2666 MHz memory.  This drive remains reserved for sample based instruments and now connects via USB 3.1, so it is even faster and more responsive than before. Thanks Glyph!<br /><br />I should add that as my sample libraries continue to grow, I've just purchased a Glyph Atom Pro 2TB, External NVMe SSD, Thunderbolt 3 which operates at read speeds up to 2,800 MB/s; and write speeds up to 2,600 MB/s  I'm transferring my orchestral libraries to the new drive and leaving sample based synths on this drive - they are less demanding on the drive.  Though I'm still in the process of moving samples, I can see the difference already.  The combination of faster more capable processor and architecture with an even faster drive runs without hiccups. The snap, crackle and unexpected silence of samples unable to load quickly enough has disappeared, even from the most extravagant orchestrations."
AFGI5XVA5EBVOE2EOS42KHQSULXA,B00CIDLKO2,5,20,True,"The StarTech Cable:<br /><br />The StarTech cable works fine, and is slightly less expensive than Apple branded. The company has a good reputation, and the cable seems well constructed. 3 meters (~9.9 foot) is about as long as is available in a copper-based Thunderbolt cable. Longer distances require specialised, and even more expensive optical fibre cables. I have used this cable as a connection in a chain of fast external drives, in connecting one Mac to another in target disk mode, and in a more rarely used function, to use one iMac as a external monitor for another. In each of these capacities the cable has been flawless.I cannot discern any difference in speed between this and the shorter Apple branded cable.<br /><br />More About Uses:<br /><br />I have two 27 inch iMac's. One is brand spanking new, and very fast. In addition to a 4 GHz i7 processor, it has a remarkable 1 TB flash drive. As a composer, using a flash drive allows me to a load samples (for example, the sounds of a string section in an orchestra) very quickly, greatly improving the overall functioning of the several software packages. My other 27 inch iMac is quite elderly and recently became cranky. It was clear to me that in addition to a small, faltering internal hard drive, that a couple other issues were causing problems. What I was happy to discover is that by attaching it via a Thunderbolt cable, I can use it as a second monitor for my newer iMac, or for my Mac laptop.  it can be used as either a mirror (showing a duplicate of your primary monitor), or as additional display space. You can’t do this with a dead machine. The iMac being converted into a monitor must still be able to boot. Only after booting can it be employed in target monitor mode.<br /><br />This setup gives me additional screen space, and allows me to place it directly in front of my midi keyboard. the old monitor typically displays the score that I’m working on, and all the controls are placed on the other screen. Macs have incredible displays, and it seemed a shame to me to spend $1000 or more([[ASIN:B00HY7PBF6 AOC Q2770PQU 27-Inch (2560x1440 Quad Resolution) LED IPS Monitor]]) for a (2560x1440) monitor, when my old iMac’s screen still functioned well. It turns out that nearly all Thunderbolt equipped iMacs can be used this way. Some older iMacs models require the use of the DisplayPort rather than Thunderbolt cable to connect. There is an Apple support page about this.<br /><br />Of course, it’s also possible to use the Thunderbolt cable as a kind of super network connection, allowing for extremely rapid flow of data from the target machine. It can also be used conventionally to connect high-speed external devices like secondary processors and fast drives.<br /><br />The Expense:<br /><br />The only problem I have with Thunderbolt is the expense.  I did some reading to find out why. The answer most frequently given has to do with licensing. It is commonly said that Apple created a high licensing fee to prevent competition. It turns out, that licensing is an issue – but not for the reasons most often given.  Intel, the creator of Thunderbolt and its partner  Apple, in order to prevent the production of inferior cables, require that all manufacturers using the term &#34;Thunderbolt&#34; purchase a license. Part of the requirement for licensure is a commitment on the part of manufacturer to assure the quality and technical specifications of the cable.<br /><br />If you've tried to buy a Thunderbolt cable here on Amazon, you'll find dozens of manufacturers create DisplayPort cables that are marked as &#34;Thunderbolt compatible.&#34; if you read carefully, or if you buy one and try it, you'll find out that it is only a DisplayPort cable. The connector is the same, but the function is not. It doesn't carry data signals,  it's only meant to connect monitors.  Licensing is an attempt to make sure that any cable actually marked with the Thunderbolt symbol meets some very exacting technical specifications. From what I've read, this really doesn't seem to be an attempt to make money, so much as a way of preventing Thunderbolt from getting a black eye.  When you read on, you'll understand why this is important<br /><br />The second reason true Thunderbolt cables are expensive is their complexity. They are not simply bundled wires with connectors at either end. In addition to wires and connectors, each cable contains a total of 12 chips plus a variety of small components, mostly resistors – all encapsulated within the plastic shroud at each end.  This technology permits the formidable flow of both power and data, both at rates unavailable from any other competing type  of cable. Unlike HDMI or USB, the Thunderbolt makers (which is not really a consortium, so much as a moment to moment alliance between Intel which created Thunderbolt as a proprietary technology, and Apple which early on was looking for an alternative to FireWire and slowpoke USB) wanted to develop a cable which would permit sufficient data rates as to connect virtually any type of component, be it a computer or high-speed device. In the latest versions of the  Mac Pro – which is one of the fastest desktop machines available, Thunderbolt is the principle connection for external drives and components,  even replacing eSATA and other short distance high-speed connection types.  When this computer arrived on the market there was an almost audible intake of breath. It's a very small device, and there's no room for internal expansion. Apple relies on Thunderbolt for virtually all system expansion except memory.<br /><br />You don't need Thunderbolt for an inkjet. You might want it when you buy the next generation 3-D printer. At 40 Gb per second connection rates, the current generation permits copper wire, three meter connections to fast monitors and hard drives that is currently unparalleled. The next generation is going to be even more extraordinary. USB-C, has great potential. It seems that Apple, Intel and others involved in the development of Thunderbolt are going to the USB 3C connector to Thunderbolt usage. What seems very likely is that these new 3C cables are likely to be considerably more expensive than ordinary USB."

The last thing you want is for a heavy speaker falling down and hitting you in the head.<br />These are pretty small, and probably won't work well for larger speakers.<br />I also wish they had a bit more customization option in terms of how you can angle the speakers.<br />Overall, they do the job and they are a good deal for the price."
AF42ETPRZPAD2IYJZJEJA7WEYU3Q,B015PRO512,3,2,True,"1. I am not overly impressed with actual throughput - I've tested it with 4 laptops and 3 phones, all of which support various levels of AC.  Although the indicated connection speed sometimes gets close to 300 (never higher), I never get anything higher than about 75Mbit/s in actual file transfers, and that's with a direct copy to a Linux file server that's on a gigabit switch one hop away from the access point.  Wired connections to this server are faster (transfer speed is 141Mbit/s wired vs 75Mbit/s wireless, using the same laptop that reports that the wireless connection is 173.3 Mb/s right next to the AP, this laptop has an Intel 7260 capable of 867 Mb/s)<br /><br />2. I am not overly impressed with the stability.  All devices disconnect frequently (a few times per hour) and immediately reconnect.  I did not have that problem with the previous AP (WRT54GL running dd-wrt).  Any open connections die, obviously.<br /><br />UPDATE (Dec 2016):  This was caused by having both 2.4Ghz and 5.8Ghz radios use the same SSID (this is the default, by the way).  Devices would switch back and forth opportunistically (not sure why) and any open connections would die.  I set the 2.4 and 5.8 SSID's to different strings and this no longer happens.  However, my phones still occasionally disconnect (no explanation), but at least the laptops are solid.<br /><br />3. The range is better than my WRT54GL, but not dramatically so - I typically see one bar (phone) on my driveway (centrally located, non-metal siding and walls).<br /><br />I upgraded the firmware several times and tried playing with the channel widths, but it had no impact on the above.  It's not interference (RF Environment scan confirms this)<br />Should this turn out to be my error somehow, I'll try to update the review."

Usually i end up spending $15-$20 for the highly-rated panasonics - which I still like very much.  For four bucks, though, these are a steal.<br /><br />I haven't done a direct comparison with those panasonics; I don't care.  They sound OK - good enough that podcasts are intelligible, and music doesn't anger me.<br /><br />I have a good stereo system, and good headphones for listening to music.

AFTICMWDC4QVUF5G5TLPMJJMEN4A,B00F3F38O2,4,15,True,"Performance is decent, fan noise is audible, but not too annoying. So do note this is NOT a fanless case. There is a fan going on constantly.<br /><br />When you buy this, and find out it doens't boot,  you know why? Because it comes with zero RAM, and zero HDD. It's the zero ram that causes no display output. You'll see your power light flash 3 times ... that means no RAM. So get the PC1600 SO DIMMs that you need, MAKE sure they are 1.35V memories, and NOT 1.5V that will not work in this mobo.<br /><br />The HDD is expensive... as there are not many choices for micro sized SSDs that this uses. I got a 120GB Intel thing that cost like $200+.<br /><br />Overall it's cool though... and would work well as a media server I should think. I am using it for a work purpose."
AFTICMWDC4QVUF5G5TLPMJJMEN4A,B000E0E6YC,5,34,False,"Imagine a camera you can ALWAYS carry in your pocket with the following features:<br />- HD 30fps 720p<br />- SD 60fps!! (yeah, you heard it... 60 fps for fast action slo mo)<br />- record to SD (no more hideous tape!!)<br />- great still performance<br />- excellent controls<br />- decent lens<br />- less than $1000<br /><br />Well, the Sanyo HD1 hits on all factors. The quality is simply amazing folks. It is FAR FAR better on HD and SD than my Canon miniDV. There simply is no comparison in the detail. I find uncompressed miniDV picture noisy, grainy and blurry in comparison.<br /><br />The still quality is also quite decent, on par with my Sony DSC's.<br /><br />What are the downsides?<br />- image stabilization degrades the movie image, and thus I keep it turned off. This is the single biggest nit with this unit. However, I will HAPPILY trade shakiness in the image for the vast improvement in movie detail. You can remedy the shakiness with a mono/tripod, but you can't remedy movie detail if it's not there to begin with!<br />- still image camera processor isn't as intelligent as the best still camera. So as you hit low light or very bright conditions, the pics may suffer in comparison with a true dedicated DSC solution. However, the quality is very good and for a casual carryound camera, IMO, quite adequate.<br /><br />Conclusion: the best camera you can buy is the camera you have with you. I own a Canon EOS Rebel XT. I never have it with me when I need it. I would buy a true high-end HD cam, but also I would never have that bulky monster with me when I need it.<br /><br />The HD1 can stay in your pocket every day of your vacation or weekend, in your briefcase or computer case 24x7, and it is always there, ready to go. Now mix in high quality HD. And the lack of performance in the image stabilization is totally offset by the advantage that you are now equipped to sieze on the photo or movie op any time it may come up.<br /><br />Most important after the HD movie capture feature is the recording to SD card. This is absolutely a requirement going forward. Having messed around with miniDV tapes, rewinding, forwarding, breaking up movies into clips (something Windows MovieMaker 2 can NOT do by itself) is such a time consuming PAIN. SD based camcorders will automatically record all movie clips as individual files on the SD card, making viewing and editing a painless pleasure, especially when coming from the miniDV world.<br /><br />One last thing: you can't take out the SD card and plug it into a PC directly. The SD card is not formatted for Windows. You can read the SD just like any hard disk, but to do so, you have to plug in the camera (with the SD card in the camera) into your USB port on the PC, and then tell the camera to act as a card reader... then you will see a drive on My Computers and you can suck off all the video and pics using any Windows utility whatsoever.<br /><br />Sanyo, congratulations on taking a risk and making it pay off. I love this product.<br /><br />We can certainly look forward to much advances in this area, with low power MPEG4 encoding chips arriving that will encode up to 20Mbps or more and with much better image stabilization. The HD1 encodes at around 9Mbps. I confirmed this by examining the playback stream in Windows. So if you want to wait another year or two, you will be well rewarded for your patience with great advances in the category of hand held micro HD camcorders. Great time to be a photo/video buff.<br /><br />edit: one other suggestion. There websites you can visit for more info on the best settings for your HD1. Unlike other reviewers here, I have had fantastic results on indoor video. Some of these sites feature video example downloads so you can see for yourself the quality and the extent of the image stabilization problem. I myself don't feel the need to have a tripod, though I will put on a quick attach monopod mount for the times when I want that extra improvement in image stability."

AHWE4DJNE6MNLIQQUAU2XPPRSOWQ,B004G8QOJS,5,1,True,"This is the first new laptop I've had in a while. For the past years it is been a Dell XPS 410 desktop and an HP laptop provided by my job and locked down tight. The desktop is fairly quick but of course not very convenient if you move around a bit. The HP EliteBook 2930p laptop is SLOOOOOWWW! Average boot times are close to 10 minutes and every action is an exercise in patience.<br /><br />I'm an amateur astronomer and wanted a laptop I could use in the field. The primary concern was fairly long battery life. The programs I run in the field are not very cpu/memory intensive I think as they ran fine on the HP. I also wanted a laptop that was light weight, didn't have a bunch of lights on it (which I'd have to black out in the field) and at least had some respectable performance.<br /><br />At the Almost Heaven Star Party last month one of the other attendees mentioned the Toshiba Portege and how much he liked it. When I got home I did a little research and realized there were a number of different versions of the Portege. I settled on the P56X because it was available quickly through Amazon and seemed to have everything I needed. My local Best Buy had a P70 on display but none in stock. Not sure the differences but I believe that had WiMAX and the P56X does not. Not an issue... didn't really want to have to subscribe to anything else.<br /><br />So I got the P56X and it is reasonably small and quite light weight. The screen size is perfect for running things like Sky Tools 3. There's enough USB ports (3) to run the accessories I need (scope control, game controller and red LED keyboard light). I like the convenience of having an SD card reader on the top easily accessible. Nice way to backup my logs. The thing has a core i5 in it. Not sure exactly how that compares to today's processors but this is the zippiest computer I have when compared with the other two mentioned above. With a couple of (probably unnecessary) accessories - I think this thing screams!<br /><br />So here's what I added. I put in a Samsung 470 256GB SSD (huge improvement), upped memory from 4GB to 8GB (not sure of any improvement) and replaced the wifi card with an Intel 6320 (which adds bluetooth but not sure if wifi any faster as my router is only a 'g'). The SSD makes an unbelievable difference in performance. Start up for example takes about 10 seconds or so? Never timed it but it is very quick.<br /><br />Battery life... most important issue to me. I should have timed it all out with the mechanical hard drive to compare with the SSD but I didn't. I understand SSD's consume a bit less power. At any rate, on the 6-cell original battery I was getting about 8 hours of intermittent use using ECO mode. In spurts I would be downloading and installing software, playing some music and some other light work. Using about the same habits with the new 9-cell battery I'm getting about 12 hours of use before the battery drops below 10%. At 10% it says there is about 2 hours of time remaining. This is plenty of battery for the type of use I expect to get in the field.<br /><br />I've seen other comments about the extra software Toshiba loads on these devices. I deleted a few obviously useless things (Amazon links and such) but left all the Toshiba stuff alone for the most part. It doesn't seem to have any appreciable affect on performance or life.<br /><br />So... I'm loving this new machine and I think it is perfect for night time field work by the telescope. The battery lasts a long time, the computer is quick and really quiet and it doesn't take up too much space or weight. I'm real happy with this!"

AGL3OBHASSX3YQQZAGEP2NY5ZMWQ,B075VSBNQZ,5,0,True,"bought this for my 16yo son to replace his alienware x51. i wish my son liked cheaper things sometimes! anyway, he has had it for a few days now and he loves it! it was very easy to set up out the box and looks nice lit up but it is BIG. it takes up a lot of space. he has dual monitors and one thing he noted is to look at the setup diagram and make sure to insert monitor plugs where indicated as he spent a half hour trying to figure out why only one showed up...until he looked at setup diagram again. he said it is fast and his games can now be played at optimal level with no lagging. the lights and being able to see the inside is nice but honestly it isn’t needed. he has it on the floor under his desk so he doesn’t even look at it. he wanted this for what is installed inside like the intel chip and cooling system and stuff i know nothing about but any serious gamer would. he can run his graphics intensive games at optimum settings and nothing is slowed down. as a mom my big complaint is now that he has an advanced pc, he is no longer satisfied with his monitors that had cost between $300 - $400 each and now wants new monitors. it is like driving a lamborghini on acme wheels - it drives just fine but better wheels would give u the most out of the car, so to speak. besides first spending like $3k for alienware less than 3 years ago to now spending $2k on this, if u are a parent of a gamer, just be aware of the investment you have to make...it's expensive!!!!"

AF5JU3VCZM2XNQAN6T7NFJEENENA,B00LJ07JOU,4,10,False,"I really want to love this camera. it does have a lot of great features, as pointed out in other reviews and in the product details. I'm used to shooting with a Canon 5d (digital LSR, semi-pro grade camera). So I may be a little more particular than others, but when it comes to a point and shoot, there are certain things that I really must have.<br /><br />I'll start with what I like about this camera:<br />+ it's really simple to use right out of the box. the menu is easy to navigate and get around. Though I always suggest reading the manual to get the most out of any camera. If you can't find the manual, sony has it available on their website.<br />+ controls - if you want to just take snapshots at a family gathering and not worry about what settings to use, the &#34;intelligent auto&#34; or &#34;superior auto&#34; and snap away. However if you want more control, you can use aperture priority, shutter priority, or even manual mode to get the exact settings you want<br />+ high pixel resolution so I can crop later and downsize if needed<br />+ zoom level is good<br />+ perfect size - feels solid and well made in your hands and the screen on the back is good size as well<br />+ the wifi transfer feature is pretty cool and I was able to set it up easily<br /><br />What I wish was better:<br />+ yes, it has a high pixel resolution, but the JPG compression is bad. When the lighting is excellent, like outdoors, photos are pretty good, but never as sharp as I can get from other cameras. A RAW image option would probably make a huge difference here, but alas it is not available. If you're not going to be printing large photos or need high resolution, then this camera is fine. However if you need a high resolution and want to make large prints, you will most likely be disappointed. You'll see from the photo I took in the desert - had the camera set on auto mode and took the shot. it looks fine when not viewing it at 100%. But open it up and look at it in full resolution and you'll see the JPG compression. the saguaro cactus look like watercolor painting. This happens with people's faces as well - for the most part when the lighting is good, the image is decent - but you definitely do not get clear, crisp images (when viewing at 100%) with this camera. The good thing is that the pixel size is large enough that you can downsample the image and the compression becomes less noticeable.  This by far is my biggest issue with this camera.<br /><br />+ does not do well in low-light conditions. Don't even try taking images on auto without a flash in low light situations. You'll get pictures that look okay on the screen on the back of the camera, but look at them on your computer monitor and you'll see more than just JPG compression, there will be a lot of &#34;noise&#34; as well. you can probably get rid of some of these issues with some post-processing in Photoshop or another software program, but really with a point and shoot camera one should not have to spend time post-processing images. It's point and shoot for convenience<br /><br />+ I must be old school, but I do appreciate having a viewfinder on a camera. I know this is the way things are going, but it's often difficult to see the LCD screen in bright sunlight so a viewfinder would have been great for me.<br /><br />Those last three things are why I can't give this camera a 5 star rating. If you just want a good camera for taking snapshots, this is a great choice. Perhaps I'm too picky and should expect this from this level of a camera. I did note that on other photography review sites that this camera has gotten pretty good ratings. Maybe I just need to use it more because I'm too used to the quality of my dSLR. I realize that I'm not going to get dSLR quality from a point and shoot camera, but I expected it to be better than this.<br /><br />I don't really use video so I can't comment on that. One thing, though is the one-touch record button I accidentally hit a few times and ended up with a video rather than an image. I admit I need to spend more time with this camera - and if I grow to love it, I'll update this review."
AG2K4UVCTHMB2GOLBW6LVUQAFBBA,B019955W7C,5,2,True,"I was always skeptical of liquid cooling, but this changed my opinion. I'm never gonna go back to air cooling.

I always wanted a gaming computer growing up, and finally had the money to do it.<br /><br />My build consists of:<br />Intel Core i7-7700k w/ Corsair H110i Liquid Cooler<br />EVGA Geforce GTX 1080 Ti FTW3<br />32 GBs 3200mhz DDR4 Ram<br />2x 256GB Crucial SSDs<br />Dell S2716DGR (27&#34; TN Panel with G-Sync)<br /><br />I have been able to play every single game on ULTRA settings, pretty much without question. This card had all sorts of ways to quickly tell you the current running condition of the card via the EVGA software or simply looking at the 3 temperature indicating LEDs in the card (assuming your case has a window). I've read reviews about EVGA cards overheating, but I'm gonna go ahead and guess those people had poor cooling set-ups. I've never seen this card get anywhere close to overheating. It doesn't break a sweat.<br /><br />If you're spending this much money on a card, do yourself a massive favor, and get a G-Sync Monitor. G-Sycn matches the screens refresh rate with whatever the current frame rate is of the card at any given moment. Screen tearing and stuttering becomes entirely null and void, and you'll never believe how smooth your games really could be. I purchased a Dell 27&#34; S2716DGR for cheap on eBay, and it blew me away.<br /><br />In the end, this card will take any gaming experience you've had prior to this, crush it in its hands, and throw it in the trash.

AFPM2ZI2C7DVGXIF3PVKQQ3S33TA,B07PFWFVY9,3,0,True,"The computer seems to be adequate speed for my needs, but I have some issues. A prior review mentioned the display. It is hard to get a good balance from different web pages and screens. It has an Intel graphics app to adjust some things, but I still find that I am always trying to angle the screen and adjusting the colors. Maybe it's all you can expect from this type of a display. All in all, It is not a bad computer. However I paid only about $333.00. It is now quite a bit more expensive.<br /><br />I am not fond of the keyboard. The standard keyboard is shortened and shifted to the left to make room for an adding machine style number keypad at the right. It just seems awkward to me. It looks like all laptops are made this way now.<br /><br />Also, The computer is very light, meaning you have to pry it open like a clam shell every time you open it. The lower half just lifts up with the top half.<br /><br />Also, I don't like Microsoft trying to get you to sign up for an account when the computer first boots up. I think you can skip that step if you are careful to read the screen, but I was too confused by all that was going on, so I signed up. Then I cancelled the account which takes 60 days. I will have to see what are the eventual effects.<br /><br />Eventually, I completely overwrote the Microsoft Windows 10 operating system and loaded Linux Mint. There is just too much interference in my business and everyday usage with Microsoft."
AEEVALWVIHQ2RMSI2DDDQCAWLAPA,B07RG6Q5YL,2,0,True,"This case does *not* fit the M1 MacBook Air made from 2020 onward (A2337).<br /><br />The top shell fits fine.<br /><br />The bottom shell of this product has two clips on the front, two on the left, and two on the right.  The front clips and the forward clips on the left and right attach fine.  But the M1 model is *very* slightly thicker at the back than the Intel version this case was actually designed for.  So you can attach either of the rear clips (left or right), but not both.  It seems to fit if you don't look too closely, which is why a lot of people probably claim it does.

AEIYWQILFQWQ5FGHLGBFJTZPKOJQ,B07CLHGV2S,4,15,True,"*VERY IMPORTANT: BREAK THEM IN!!! If you have a 30-day return policy, USE IT. Give them 3+ weeks, 60+ hours, to break-in.<br /><br />... I swear I believe they changed the nature and focus of their sound during break-in. Happened slowly. I played rock through the ai40 though the night a lot of nights while sleeping. I played them while gaming. I probably logged 80+ hours. The pay-off: I almost don't have to use the equalizer anymore. At first, I was heavily relying on equalization. This is proof to me that they do need a serious break in period more than the 12 hours the instruction recommended.<br /><br />OTHER MAIN POINTS I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE:<br />ROCK MUSIC, etc. Reproduces complicated rock music intelligently. Rock, Jazz, Classical, Pop it all sounds good, IMO. Those are usually hard genres to make sound engaging but these shine at reproducing it. Among some of the best and most enjoyable music speakers for these genres regardless of price.<br />Tight bass drums, exciting clashing almost perfectly clean highs that bounce off the speaker and into your room, guitar is very airy and thunderous. A very excited little speaker combo.<br /><br />VOCALS are almost excellent. Biggest fault is the sibilance (10k) where the ssss's are over embellished. It is forgivable especially for this quality of sound for this price.<br /><br />IMAGING (where you hear sounds coming from places other than the speaker) is amazing. The speakers draw almost no attention to themselves. This is probably what shocks me the most about listening to these speakers play. It is like the mid-range is floating in air rather than coming from a speaker.<br /><br />Contrast (my definitions of) IMAGING to SOUNDSTAGE (are these the official meanings?), I believe imaging is different than soundstage in that soundstage is a virtual wall of sound that envelopes you - something my definitive technology bipolar tower speakers do very well. The Def Tech aren't as good at imaging - or sound placement - as these are.<br /><br />The ai40 do not quite have what I would consider a huge soundstage, as much as the sound is full and the sound seems to originate from other places than the speaker. You might hear noises that sound to come from behind the speaker, from the side, behind you and often vocals are locked somewhere near the center. I find this a highly enjoyable quality, especially for speakers made for a laptop. I think it is perfect for laptop or in a small bedroom.<br /><br />Unfortunately the ai40 isn't the best for Reggae or music that REALLY needs the lowest bass or music you would listen to just for bass effects. The bass on the ai40 is super impressive for it's size, and it is tight and tantalizing (in that you wish it would go lower). You won't get much below about 50 hz. It might get down to 40 but it won't hit the lowest notes. .And Fluance didn't give us the option to add a sub (BIGGEST BUMMER of this set). If you like your Reggae, Pop, Rap (dare I say) with the deepest bass, you won't get it with these. =(<br /><br />That sucks because it they sound so good and work so well. If you can live without lowest bass and don't expect so much sound that you would get from a set of DefTech towers, these are super enjoyable.<br /><br />I rate a 4 because of no subwoofer out and the sibilance in the tweeter. Also, room placement can be a problem. I wanted these in my kitchen but they don't sound the best in there, in the spot I have to put them. My Samsung R3 works better for my kitchen. JS<br /><br />Value : 9 (I bought for $170, for $200 maybe a 7 or 8)<br />Sound Quality : 8 (with the disclaimer you can't get the lowest bass and some sibilance in the highs)<br />Imaging : 9 (probably 10 but leaving room assuming something could put a shiner on them)<br />Versatility: 5 (lack of sub out, lack of being able to put them anywhere to get optimal performance, possible need for an equalizer; positives are bluetooth, self-powered, controller)<br />Build Quality: So far seems to be a 9 for the price<br />WAF/Look/Design/Included Accessories: 9 (no grills -_- but dig the lucky bamboo)<br /><br />Recommended highly in place of Bose products. Recommended for everyone but super anal audiophiles. Fun, great, enjoyable, lovely speakers."

AE24VPMWEEQD62YPOG53BW7JCGFA,B07868DF7P,5,4,True,"I got these to connect 2 monitors to my Surface Pro 7 using the Surface Dock (1 gen model). The Surface Dock has 2 mini-DP output jacks and my monitors luckily have DP input ports.<br /><br />At first, I thought these cables were bad because they just wouldn't work with my Surface Dock at all. If you have the Surface Dock and these don't work for you, don't be quick to blame the cables because it's most likely not the cables (for this particular scenario which I will describe).<br /><br />The Surface Pro Dock worked with the Display Port when it first came out, but then Intel changed their software drivers for the display chip inside the Surface Dock. Since Windows 10 looks for and updates everything to the latest version of the software, they dutifully update Intel drivers whenever Intel releases new ones.<br /><br />The problem is that the *newer* version of the Intel graphics drivers (on the Surface Pro 7) doesn't work with the Surface Dock . . . AT ALL! This took me a while to figure out and the solution is very stupid, but it works. You have to manually load an older version of the Intel IRIS graphics drivers for the Intel Integrated graphics. Specifically, the version that I had to use was 25.20.100.7101which comes from an older version of the Surface Pro 7 drivers package which is ""SurfacePro7_Win10_18362_19.103.34215.0.msi"" You only need the graphics drivers from that package, not everything else. Simply trying to run that package won't work because you'll get a message that there are newer drivers and it will quit.<br /><br />Rather than trying to explain everything here, I'll just say that do an internet search and if you're tech-savvy, you'll be able to figure it out. I'll include a few photos that show the versions that work. Unless Intel releases a patch then this is the best solution I could find to get my Surface Pro 7 to work with dual DP monitors via the Surface Dock. If you have a tech-savvy friend, just show them the photos and they should be able to get your Surface Dock working with these cables.<br /><br />All of that was just to put some of the other reviews into context. There could be some people who received defective cables, but if they mention issues with Intel graphics, then it's probably not a faulty cable. Again, this is just my own personal experience with the cables specifically on the Surface Pro 7 with the Surface Dock (gen 1). YMMV.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great value to get things working for my 2 1920x1080 monitors. It's a good quality cable and having them as a 2-pack was exactly the solution I needed. I hope this might help anyone else who is having the same issue.<br /><br />I would buy these again and would definitely recommend them for the specific devices that I mention above. Great quality, great price."

I have read that the Intel Atom processor is the one to have in these machines for speed and power efficiency.<br /><br />I did not want an SSD drive. I have read repeatedly that these drives, while maybe more shock resistent than conventional hard drives, are just not as reliable as you may think. The small size of the SSD drives was also a deterrent.<br /><br />This is the most inexpensive netbook of this size and weight running Windows. I just don't want to carry around a very pricy laptop (fear of theft and damage), and in this era of carry on luggage I wanted something I could easily slip into my carry on bag. No problem here.<br /><br />I must admit that I do not have another netbook for direct comparison with this one. I can only compare it with the Dell, Sony and MacBook laptops I have used. That said, I cannot agree with some of the negative comments a few people have made.<br /><br />The machine is exceptionally solid and well designed and put together. It is stunning to look at. An associate at work who owns an Acer said the Eee PC is more professional looking than his. Just a personal opinion here, but the shiny finish is especially good looking.<br /><br />The screen is very bright and clear. No trouble reading any websites despite the 8.9"" size. It is comparable in appearance to the screens on my Sony and MacBook, side by side.<br /><br />I expected to find the keyboard to be a problem. Some people have complained about the size and key placement. I was pleasanly surprised here. Of course the keyboard is smaller than standard size. What do you expect in this size machine? A larger keyboard means a larger footprint, and I specifically didn't want that.<br /><br />The keys are well spaced. The key action is very smooth. Unlike some I have had no problem touch typing, and have found the right shift key no problem. Admittedly my hands are not overly large - I wear a medium golf glove. If you have really big paws such a small keyboard might not be for you.<br /><br />The touchpad is a real treat. It is smooth and responsive, and the two finger scroll function makes internet navigation a snap.<br /><br />Battery life has been a wonderful 4.5 to 5 hours on the clock.

Putting a 135W Core i7 inside this case will limit your OC because of inability to dissipate heat even with a Cooler Master V8 after-market cooler and roaring fans so I don't recommend Core i7 chips in this case particularly with the Intel stock cooler. The heat issue cannot be fixed without ruining the case or features because to drill large fan-holes through the sidewalls or mod for larger than 120 mm fans would make it louder. In other words, putting in large cfm fans like Deltas would make the case very loud and ruin the reason many prefer this case. The air-flow is poorly designed with the best flow in the hard drive and power supply space in the bottom. That means you have cool hard drives but a hot CPU - not good.<br /><br />Other thoughts: I would not have purchased this case except a friend wanted a dust-free case and this is popular. Unfortunately, Antec does not tell us how lame the cooling is. They call it a gaming rig. But if something seems too good to be true, it just may be. Air-cooling a Core i7 does not allow for niceties like filters if you are going to get a maximum overclock. Antec says it's a good gamer machine but I have been gaming on PC's since the 1980's and this case runs too hot. It is probably a great case for HTPC or for when you need it really quiet. It's just Antec marketing annoys me when they try to sell it as something it is not.<br /><br />Since I last built with this case in 2009, there are newer cooling solutions - hybrids between water and air made by Corsair and Cool-It that may work well in this case but I have not read any reports. Let's hope that works. In the mean time, I overclock great with my Cooler Master HAF 932 while my friend has to watch her temps and is unable to even use her P183 Core i7 machine if ambient temps get high because she has no air-conditioning (minus one star). Antec engineers need to go back to the drawing board to improve native air-cooling (minus one star) and Antec marketing needs to quit lying about this being a gaming machine (minus the third star). My friend is bringing the rig back to me, hoping I have a solution. I will clean it up, re-apply TIM, put in a C0 920 instead of D0; and if the load temps are too high, try a Corsair or Cool-It solution. Perhaps I should just try to talk her into a case with decent air-flow?"

They are about 6 inches long which doesn’t seem like a lot but it goes around a lot of wire. I love the yellow because it really stands out against a dark area. I have not used any other color yet. The notch on the end is great so you can put the cord through the notch and hold it better in place. Overall, this was excellent. The only fun thing is the way they come . The package is extremely tiny and you say to yourself how could they possibly fit 120 of these ties in this package well they’re all in there spooning against each other based on the color and you have to pull them apart that in itself is a fun project for people who like games that they do to test their strength and intelligence it’s really good to try to get these apart, but they’re definitely gonna stay together until you need one to use.

AHHQMVOQSY4WOIU5AWA5AEAQPJ6Q,B08CHLR8SW,4,2,False,"Testing this item took a bit of time because of an audio popping sound ONLY when starting, restarting, and shutting down the computer. I am testing this device on a Mini PC running windows 10 and the Mini PC output jack has gone looney and will only play one channel, so I needed a good USB audio controller to connect to the computer USB port.<br /><br />At first I thought the problem was possible because my speaker monitor cable was not working properly, but replacing with a new one didn't solve the problem. Then  I thought maybe it’s the Mini PC so I connected the 3D sound audio controller to a different full desktop PC running a newer Intel 10th generation motherboard with USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports. The test results were the same when turning on and off the computer.  It’s not an annoying pop sound but I could certainly hear it. It didn’t matter if I turned the volume on the computer up or down as the pop sound was still there. I also did a final test connecting a pair of headphones to the 3D Sound audio controller and got the same pop sound results when turning on and off the computer.<br /><br />Final thoughts: This device does sound good through my monitor speakers after the pop sound stops. Another thought is because my monitor audio turns on automatically as the computer begins start up.  The sound quality is clean and clear while listening to videos and audio, and if I had separate audio amplifier and kept it off until after the computer start up, all would be fine."

I use the 500 GB drive along side my very quiet MacBook Pro laptop and with Leopard's (Mac OS X 10.5) TimeMachine backup software. Lacie's drive is periodically woken (about every hour) from it's sleep by Time Machine to create a backup snapshot of the laptop's internal drive. Waking from its completely silent sleep, the Lacie can be heard, but it is the whir of the 500 GB drive and a fairly quiet fan, which can vary depending upon the amount of data to be written, the length of time it takes, and (surprisingly) the room's temperature. While louder than the very quiet MacBook Pro laptop, the drive's noise is not objectionable to me, but it does vary.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Intelligent way drive wakes from silent sleep & returns to sleep when done<br /> - Works well with Apple's TimeMachine backup software<br /> - 2 Firewire & 3 USB 2.0 ports excellent addition to computer that needs more (Mac Mini & laptops)<br /> - Good price for 500 GB drive<br /> - Very fast drive (quicker than my laptop's Internal Hard Drive)<br /> - Built like a tank, but looks nice, even without complementary looking Mac Mini<br /><br />Cons:<br /> - Not absolutely quiet; fan-less drives quieter<br /> - Has a fan<br /> - Not cheapest 500 GB drive<br /> - Takes a bit more desk space than a 'vertical' drive<br /><br />I recommend this drive to anyone who needs extra Firewire &/or USB 2.0 ports, and it's also a perfect, complementary design for Mac Mini owners.

Despite her iMac (Intel Core Duo) having Bluetooth built in, a separate receiver that connects to a USB port, and ties it up, is required. Setup was otherwise simple and no problems with connectivity for the keyboard and mouse. She likes the keyboard, as she's had one before, but when I use it (very infrequently), I feel a bit clumsy at first due to the much different placement of the keys than my desktop Mac's (Apple) standard keyboard. My wife's only (mild) complaint about the keyboard is that it sounds a bit tinny-plasticy, and she is very sensitive to key tapping and other sounds. It sounds a bit cheaper than my keyboard, but I do not find it as annoying as she does. This is the main reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5, the other because of the need to have a separate receiver instead of using the Mac's built in Bluetooth. Her much greater regret is she no longer has the original ergonomic keyboard she had at work and is lobbying to get the Logitech for her work computer too.<br /><br />The Mouse:<br />My wife had a wireless Microsoft mouse prior to this keyboard, and liked it.

You don't want the nVidia card to be default for everything. It uses more power, more processing power, and more ram. For simple tasks, just let the integrated card do the work.

AHJ6UYW4GX6ITZBEMSP5SCYG4D3A,B093B8C3GX,5,0,True,"I decided to see if I could get an NVME solution working on an old X58 system. Before putting it into a workstation I tried it out on a Linux server (supermicro dual xeon x5675). The NVME throughput was about 2x the SATA-II interface on the board, so I think that it's running at Sata-III speeds through a PCI-e 2.0 x16 slot. I was hoping for faster performance (like 10x Sata-II) but it works perfectly and it's half the price of the next competitor.<br /><br />I also tested the M.2 SSD piece and it works perfectly albeit at the motherboard's speed, so Sata-II speeds. I have another Sata-II SSD in the same computer and this board apparently made better use of the interface as the M.2 SSD was about 15% faster than an Intel SSD running through the same M/B IO controller. The M.2 SSD was recognized by the legacy BIOS but the NVME was not.<br /><br />I had a problem with my card at about the 5 month mark (Sata stopped working). I got in touch with the seller and asked about a warranty replacement. They replied to my message via Amazon in one business day and, after gathering my address, mailed me a replacement that arrived three days later. For a relatively inexpensive product like this, the seller quickly made good on their warranty.  This is the sort of reputable company that I like to deal with. I will look for them again, next time I want to buy computer electronics. Just awesome to get this sort of support! I don't write a ton of glowing reviews, but here's one: Highly recommended."
AELPQL5EBYWEKUZPWCI5M7SB44XQ,B0034CSTFY,1,10,True,"First, I give Amazon high marks for their help through the numerous issues with this motherboard.<br /><br />Gigabyte Technology customer support, on the other hand has been of little help. This isn't my first computer build, and there were NO problems installing or connecting the motherboard. It simply does not function correctly. Everything works except when I have a memory stick in the first (white, closest to CPU) slot. With ANY memory stick in the first slot the board will not enter BIOS setup and Windows-7 will not restart.<br /><br />Customer support walked me through basic checks (that I had already tried), like disconnect all drives and expansion boards, move memory sticks around, try with only one memory stick, update BIOS, look for bent pins in the CPU socket, etc, etc. BTW, what would I do if there were bent socket pins? Straighten them? That's a manufacturing issue, not MY problem.<br /><br />Amazon sent a replacement motherboard, SAME problem. In addition, the second board had the infamous restart issue that many reviewers mention. Gigabyte then said it was probably the CPU memory manager. Intel didn't think so, but quickly stated I should return the CPU as it's guaranteed for 3 years. Amazon sent a replacement, SAME problem.<br /><br />Then Gigabyte challenged the memory manufacturer, which they later recanted after checking. Then said they'd have to set up a simulation at their site, then they said, NO, you must RMA the motherboard WITH your CPU ... at MY cost, and with a CPU disclaimer (If it was damaged they aren't responsible), and all this would probably take weeks.<br /><br />The person at their RMA department was arrogant and not customer focused at all! Said, ""two boards, two CPUs it's obviously something YOU did"". Nice service attitude, the customer is always wrong. Couldn't possibly be a Gigabyte issue. This person shouldn't be in that job.<br /><br />BTW, I have never received the RMA e-mail from Gigabyte. Simply unacceptable customer service.<br /><br />And please, Gigabyte, don't send your form-letter ""gee, we're sorry, contact us at ..."". If you are actually sincere about customer service, why didn't you handle things properly the first time around, why now? I have lost confidence in Gigabyte Technology.<br /><br />I am just biting the bullet and will purchase a competitive motherboard.<br /><br />I recommend people read the low star reviews, they are accurate!<br /><br />Followup 4/16/2011: Purchased ASUS Sabertooth X58 motherboard, installed and operates perfectly.

Security + backup software is a plus.<br /><br />However, RAID never worked! I've been fighting with Tech support for days (It will take you about 50 mins. waiting on the phone to get to them each time.) and nothing works.  Tech support simply push back the problem to customers and indicated it's your ""windows"" problem.<br /><br />1. Raid driver can't find the USB hard drive.  On the first public version of driver, it creates C++ error. The newest version simply can't find the hard drive.<br /><br />2. If you are looking for mac support, there is none. The newest driver ""README.TXT"" indicated that, newest driver only works under PowerPC chip with OSX. So if you have intel core duo, good luck to find the RAID driver.<br /><br />3. When I first spoke with tech support about RAID problem, they said it might be my windows.  Actually, I've tried 7 computers with 3 of them are clean installed. Nothing works! the RAID software simply CAN NOT FIND ANY DEVICE on the USB, even your hard drives are working and running.<br /><br />4. Tech told me the RAID is hardware raid, however, it requires ""THE DRIVER"" to work. Where, most of people on the net will tell you, ""THE DRIVER"", never worked. So, if you are unlucky just like me, you have to run 2 USB drives at same time instead of any RAID/MIRROR support on this thing. they simply don't have it yet.  The newest driver 1.01 was dated as far back as June 2006, and there is no newer driver existing so far.<br /><br />Buffalo's linkstation gaves me nice experiences (only down side was the transfer rate), but this Drivestation Duo turns me away. I'll never going to be business with Buffalo ever again in my life. It's too painful to call in and gets no results whatsoever.<br /><br />============== UPDATE Feb/27/07 ==================================<br />After a few weeks of problem solving, I am able to make the RAID work now.<br /><br />Since the utility came with CD or ""buffalo"" tech support suggested version was never worked. (RAID utility simply can't find the Hard drive itself), and MAC raid utility only support OS 9 or older.<br /><br />Instead of killing myself without a RAID feature which I paid for, I went to Japanese website to download the newest RAID utility.  First of all, if you have the connection problem like I do, and you only have windows machines, I have to tell you the sad news.  Even Japanese (NEWEST update) RAID utility still won't work under windows XP SP2.<br /><br />Instead, You need an IntelMac (like macbook/pro), hook up with firewire (only works under firewire connection), and fire up the Japanese version of the RAID utility.  It will find the Drivestation Just fine.<br /><br />If you don't read Japanese, basicaly, there are 3 options under the RAID menu, and once you opened up the utility, you see 2 partition (2 separated HD on the list), and you will have 3 options.  1st, remain 2 Partitions. 2nd, Make them into one 500GB partition. 3rd, make into RAID 1 configuration.<br /><br />Here is the tricky part!! Since windows RAID utility didn't work, You have to make your RAID configuration on MAC through firewire.  However, You HAVE TO USE USB2.0 connection to the Windows machine after this.  After you configured your DriveStation into 500GB or RAID 1, You will either see a 500GB HD after reboot the Drivestation on Mac, OR!!! You will see nothing (Partition worked, but MAC has no longer access the right partition.)<br /><br />So, You need to use USB 2.0 connection back to Windows, and fire up the ""Format program"" that came with original CD. (Sorry! No MAC utility here!).  Here! You can delete/create/format a partition.  And after format the Drivestation into FAT32, both of your PC/MAC will see it and work perfect after that.<br /><br />Since the front pannel did indicate 1, 2 as first and second hard drive in LED. If your RAID 1 worked, they both will access almost at same time when you are using the Hard Drive.  Fully RAID 1 baby!!<br /><br />If you made them into a Huge 500GB, it works the same too.. 2 Hard Drive will access at same time (Almost).  It is much better than 2 separated Hard Drives.<br /><br />============ WARNING ===================<br />This is personal testing result.  Actual procedure might facing difficulty I haven't encountered.  So, if this method don't really work for you, please don't contact me.  Just call Buffalo-tech then.<br /><br />Be honest, I think Buffalo-USA did a bad job of re-writting the entire utility.  They simply didn't do a full testing on it.  Japanese one didn't work as well.  You will also see FW update.. I didn't try that at all. This is the catch.. if FW fails.. You never gotta know how to get back to the original FW in the first place."

AEEPBDI2EERWAXKOFUMUYFCIWGUQ,B00005TQ08,4,2,True,"I bought this mouse because I was tiring of wireless mice that kept going on the fritz and needing new batteries. I was looking specifically for a wired mouse with five buttons.<br /><br />Pros: this mouse is HIGHLY programmable, with a very impressive list of actions that you can assign to each button. It is comfortable to hold, and unlike many mice that I have seen, the side buttons are very easy to push.<br /><br />Cons: I find this mouse to be just a wee bit sluggish, even with the speed of the driver turned up to maximum. I would like it to go just a little bit faster. When I tried using it on my bare coffee table, it seemed to scratch a little bit, with the result that I put a mouse pad under it. I have a nice mouse pad, so problem solved. I did have a problem installing the driver, though this was a minor problem. The driver comes on a CD that is meant for use with many different types of Microsoft mice, and in the installation process you must choose what type of mouse you have. Supposedly, the type of mouse you have is written on the bottom of the mouse, but I could not find it, and had to rely on the packaging to identify the mouse. I will have to label the disc for future use so that I can remember the type of mouse. (Microsoft Intellimouse Optical)<br /><br />It comes with a USB to green ps2 adapter, so that it may be used either with a USB port on your laptop or the ps2 port on your desktop. The ps2 port is the green circular one, usually located at the back of your desktop, near the top.  I tried to use the adapter on my desktop, and found that it didn't work.<br /><br />Other thoughts: this is one of the largest mice that I have owned, so I think it would fit well for those with larger hands. However, it is not so large that I cannot handle it with my small hands. The advertising says that it was designed with comfort in mind, and I believe that this is true. The top of the mouse is high and gently rounded so that it supports the palm of your hand."

We added an intelligently designed, inexpensive Poetic case to the Kindle for protection.<br /><br />While I thought she would mainly use the Kindle while traveling, I was mistaken.  She now uses it when getting ready for work in the morning playing TED videos for inspiration; plus she multitasks constantly finding online answers to those instantaneous nagging questions that pop into an active mind at any given moment.

AGY4G55GM32Z5DTUVQGH6H2RENEA,B006K553QA,4,3,False,"I really wish this could have been an Amazon purchase, but after watching the prices for 2 months, and realizing I would still be buying from a third party that may or may not be a Sony authorized dealer, I just went ahead and chose an authorized dealer listed on the Sony site that also had great Google reviews.  Saved me 30-50 dollars that way.  If you're spending more than $139 total, you may consider this route too (sadly).  I chose this camera after extensive research on reviews, both professional and by users, and tried the cameras out in stores first.<br /><br />Anyway.. on to the camera.  I just got it in the mail today and have been playing with it on and off. I have an 8gb, class 10 card in it. While it's not the most amazing camera ever made, I get a number of great usable shots, even with a wiggly child, just using the intelligent photo mode. I don't have to try and get her to hold still for 3-5 seconds anymore, and got many photos while I had her moving around, just to see what would happen. It's no 100%, but it's pretty blasted good, and for the size and price point? Incredibly good. My Kodak ran around $200-250 when I bought it, and even on sports mode, doesn't do as well as this Sony in this respect.  The march of technology I guess. So, I guess while not being  the most incredible camera ever, it's one of the most incredible I've actually had in my hands and knew how to use, regardless of price point.<br />The color grabber mode (where everything is black and white, except the color you choose - red, blue, green, yellow) is fun and seems quite accurate :).  This camera is sometimes scary smart, and it's neat to see what mode it sets itself to as you're moving around in different environments. It feels like it's lightyears ahead of my kodak in this respect.  Like the difference between cell phones and smart phones.  And fast?  Omg.. it's MAYBE a full second after turning on that I can take a photo.  No lie.  And I can take back to back photos quickly!  The only mode that seems to take forever is the high iso (to be expected, high isos are usually painfully slow) and the intelligent+.  I was NOT impressed by the intelligent+, as it seemed to add skin softening effects to the photos I took.  And it takes longer to process, so you're down to 2-5 seconds between shots. Macro mode, letting the camera select it while in Intelligent auto, was pretty impressive for a little camera. Things like pen caps, the small text at the bottom of a bottle of crafting stuff... clear as day and big on screen.  I can't wait to try taking photos of flowers with this :)<br />Video so far has been very impressive too.  I took a test video in dim indoor lighting, and it came our great.  Not grainy, the sound was awesome.  Very cool.  And this was on the mp4 setting (which is more universal for websites and programs). The photo-from-video I took was just like a screen shot from the movie.  Same colors, lighting, clarity.<br /><br />Now, the bad.  I, too, found the door to the battery/card compartment to be seriously weak.  C'mon, Sony! When closed, it still leaves a hair of a gap (just enough to gather dirt). The internal latch that actually keeps the door closed is so incredibly tiny.  Out of everything to go wrong on this camera, I'd say it would be that before anything else.  It does come with a 1 year manufacturer warranty, so let's see how far I get with it.  If nothing else, it looks like you could secure it with tape if you had to, and it wouldn't interfere with anything else.<br />Oh, and don't pull on the wrist strap.  Due to the incredibly tiny size of this camera, it seems the plastic on this is a bit on the lighter side, too.  But, you really shouldn't be tugging hard on it anyway, so I don't see this as a serious flaw.  Just be aware.  This camera is tiny and built for small size and small weight. Why wouldn't you consider something like that as anything but delicate?  It's smaller and lighter than my droid phone by a good measure.  Crazy. I have small hands and a great sense of feel, so this camera is incredibly easy for me to use.  I have no problem getting the zoom to work perfect, the selection wheel to go where I want it to (it doesn't look like it from the photos, but aside from it being a 4 way directional button, there really is a wheel there too!)  Contrary to some reviews I have read, it does have a ""half-press"" shutter action, as in, pressing it halfway down gets your focus, and all the way down takes your picture.  It's just incredibly sensitive, and takes a very light touch. I actually love this, but I could see a lot of people having issues without knowing ahead of time.  The menu takes just a little while to figure out.  For me, going from a kodak to a sony, it was still a breeze to figure it all out.  I had a minor hick up in getting it to recognize the card I formatted for the Sony, though. I had to go into the settings for the photo files, and it figured it out from there.<br /><br />Overall, I would say this is an awesome camera for what I was looking for:  something very very fast, something small, and something that takes good photos with little effort.  This totally fit the bill. I have a feeling I may be using this much more than the more expensive Kodak I bought just a year or two ago.  It's just so much easier to carry, and is so much faster, which is what I need with a small child! The Kodak can do some really neat things, but like another reviewer says, you miss every shot you don't take, and when your camera is 1 lb+ and big, you don't take as many as you could.<br />If the plastic was a little thicker maybe, or at very least, the battery door latched better, I would consider giving this 5 stars.  It really is a smart, fast, fun little camera.  I hope to continue updating this post as time goes on, as I do most of my reviews on electronics and household items.  I also hope to add a video to this review of things I have mentioned here, as well as uploading photos.<br /><br />Update March 12, 2013:  I haven't gotten a ton of playtime with it yet.  But I have yet to recharge the battery.  I expected it to dissipate quickly in the camera due to some other reviews, but it's still showing a totally full charge. Very cool :)  Pet mode doesn't seem to have a flash, so becareful using it in low light areas.  It takes good photos, but my dog highly distrusts it, flash or no, and wont hold still.  Ah well.  So far, still perfect for my needs: fast, good pics, and few errors. I should get more use by Easter, and hopefully get that video up soon!<br /><br />Update March 20, 2013:  I went to finish this review up with some video of the door issue, but it seems a bit of a moot point now.  The manufacturer (sony) has discontinued this camera, so getting a hold of a new one for a reasonable price looks to be almost impossible right now.  It looks like the successor of this camera comes in the form of the WX80 and the more expensive WX300, both of which have wifi and very similar features to this one (even the same buttons and case and look of this model).  I only hope they fixed the battery door issue, because that was the only real complaint I had on this model.  So far, I am still in love with this camera, and I am STILL on the same original charge on the battery. I can't wait to get more usage out of it, and if it gives me a good run, I will definitely consider the WX300 or whatever else they come up with in the future."

AGPTFY2V3PFCDGTO3N5HWOLLCX3A,B00A29UWRA,5,3,False,"So far I am loving this laptop.  I'll update this review more later because I have only been using it for 4 hours.  I will share here my thought process, etc. that drove me to purchase this (which may be helpful to others) as well as feedback on actual use so far.<br /><br />-  Requirement number 1 for me is Windows 7.  Windows 8 is awful.  I bought a nice Samsung laptop at Best Buy for $300 less than this laptop.  Unfortunately it had Windows 8 which is AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL.  If you are considering ""going there"" . . . think again.  I also have a Samsung Tab 2 device with Windows 8 and it is fine on that device.  But not for laptop or notebook!!  Thank goodness for Best Buy's 30 day return policy.  Only reason I am returning Samsung laptop (and such a nice screen display too) is because of god-awful Windows 8 which is just not practical for my needs on laptop. My advice is to go on internet and do search for Windows 8 reviews and you will see many comments so you can decide for yourself.  And after using Windows 7 I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE it.  Better than Windows XP which I had been using before but yet not a huge paradigm shift either.  Not these huge icons everywhere.  Stuff is more organized and accessible.<br /><br />-  RAM.  After some research I found that my minimum requirements should be at least 4GB RAM (because otherwise not fully utilizing 64 bit processor somehow).  This laptop has 6GB RAM so that exceeds !<br /><br />-  Intel chip not AMD.  My minimum was Intel 3 and this has Intel 5 so again exceeds my requirement.  AMD is preferred by most gamers because of graphics but I do not play games - life too short - I use laptop for looking stuff up, online shopping, you tube videos, connecting to work, Office Word and Excel, etc.).  The thing I learned about AMD chips is that they get HOT (!!) and I did not want that worry or buy special pad to cool laptop so Intel it is.<br /><br />-  Keypad.  That is another big thing I needed.  This laptop has keypad.  Many laptops (or notebooks) do not.<br /><br />-  CD / DVD player.  Surprisingly, not all laptops or notebooks have a CD/DVD slot these days!!  I need to install software (like TurboTax) via CD.  Yes, software can be downloaded however I prefer sometimes to install via CD.  Plus I can play my music CDs.<br /><br />-  USB ports.  It has both 2.0 and 3.0.  3.0 is faster!  Nice to have.<br /><br />-  VGA plugin so I can use at home with monitor.  This is so nice - I have monitor to use at home on my desk.  That way I can be using 2 screens at once.  Very nice.<br /><br />-  HDMI plug - so I can hookup to my new Samsung TV monitor!<br /><br />-  Audio - very nice, definitely better than my Samsung.<br /><br />I'll update more later as I learn more.

AH5Q3Y2QF53XZWWU5ARZNNIZSJZA,B01A69YZZU,3,3,False,"While this 256gb Impact by Mushkin isn't a bad drive, I am still hesitant to recommend it to others. The good points of this drive include a solid aluminum casing, the use of reliable MLC NAND (over inferior TLC NAND) (NAND being the flash memory that stores the data), outstanding read speeds, and an affordable price. BUT…this USB flash drive has poor write speeds. Most USB 3 drives struggle when it comes to smaller writes, and this problem is caused by the native USB 3 controllers. This particular drive uses a Phison controller, and this controller is known for having slower write speeds. Additionally, this controller has not been around long enough to say much about long term reliability...considering there are major differences in controller reliability, this is somewhat concerning (i.e., Marvell, Samsung, and Intel make outstanding controllers with a solid track record, where as SandForce controllers have had major problems with long-term reliability.)<br /><br />I bought this drive based on reviews using benchmarks, only to find that benchmarks really did not accurately predict how this drive would behave based on my own use. I purchase MLC flash drives and SD cards mainly for the reliability & endurance over TLC NAND, but MLC also tends to be quicker in real world speeds...but that was not the case here.<br /><br />How does this Impact by Mushkin 256gb drive compare to my other MLC drives? With a test file that was about 22gb size and had thousands of small files, hundreds of medium files, and about 30 large video files, it took the Mushkin about 20 minutes to complete the transfer. The MLC Samsung PRO+ 64gb microSD card did this transfer in under 6 minutes. My 128gb MLC Transcend USB flash drive did this transfer in about 13 minutes. The 128gb SanDisk Fit, which is a budget-based nano-sized flash drive, did the transfer in about 25 minutes. So my real world write speeds of the Impact is closer to budget drives than it is performance drives.<br /><br />With such a pronounced difference in write speeds, I think this drive is best matched to Buyers who do NOT mind slow write speeds. It is affordable; it has solid construction; and it's made from MLC NAND. However, as the Samsung PRO+ can write four times the speed of this 256gb Mushkin Impact (and when writing many small files, the Samsung PRO+ is closer to 10 times faster), that is a big productivity gain and may very well justify the higher price of the Samsung PRO+ (not to mention the fact that it uses Samsung's premium MLC NAND, which, having proven itself to be fast, reliable, and durable, has become an industry benchmark.) Given that, this drive may or may not suit your individual needs.<br /><br />NOTE--Bear in mind that the Impact model I tested is a 256gb size. Mushkin also offers the Impact in a 64gb and 128gb size. As with other flash memory devices, as the size decreases, the write speeds rapidly decrease with it. So these 64gb and 128gb Impact models are likely slower, and possibly dramatically slower. Should Mushkin release a 512gb Impact drive in the future, chances are it will have dramatically higher write speeds than the 256gb size Impact. YMMV."
AH5Q3Y2QF53XZWWU5ARZNNIZSJZA,B00KFAGCWK,5,2,True,"BUY SOON...SUPPLIES ARE LIMITED!!!<br />As you likely know, the MX100 is being discontinued. The MX200 is replacing it and the design of the MX200 is substantially different. However, I recommend purchasing this MX100. Why? Check out the customer Reviews here...real-world usage and testing has shown the MX100 to sport excellent performance, outstanding quality NAND, and industry-leading reliability. The MX100 has withstood the test of time, and you can now rest assured that if you buy a MX100 that you will get many years (decades, in fact) of reliable & trouble-free performance. Additionally, the firmware for the MX100 has been revised over time to a point in which the firmware is now optimal for both performance and reliability. (It is also worth noting that the MX200 does NOT outperform the MX100 in many instances and in some cases the MX100 gives faster real-world performance...this is likely in part due to the MX100's maturation time for the firmware and in a few years the MX200 will see increasingly better performance & reliability.)<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />WHY CRUCIAL?<br />The MX100, like previous Crucial SSDs, is reliable, affordable, and fast. Not many SSDs meet ALL of those three criteria.<br /><br />Virtually any modern SSD will give ridiculously fast performance compared to the older HDDs, but few makers have the reliability of Crucial. The Marvel controller used in the MX100 I consider to be among the best when it comes to removing garbage and leveling disk wear. Crucial's usage of the higher-endurance Multi-Level Cell NAND, the quality of this NAND, and the affordability for a high-quality MLC SSD all weighed in. Previous experiences also played a role. I own various C300, C400, and M4 SSDs. These drives have given flawless performance and many have written over 100-150+ TB on them (far exceeding their advertised rating.)  I also like how Crucial SSDs play nice with all the major OS'...I have used them with Win 7, Win 8.1, and the past 5 revisions of OS X. These drives work wonderfully with all of these operating systems.<br /><br />--------------------------------<br /><br />DESCRIPTION & SPECS<br />I do not want to go too in-detail here as many others have done a great job covering it already. More or less, the Crucial MX100 is one of Crucial's mainstream-performance SSDs. It uses MLC flash memory (which has better duration than the cheaper TLC), uses a Marvell controller, and comes in 128, 256, 512 GB sizes. It is one tier below the M550, but it uses the same Marvel controller of the M550. It has been shrunken to the 16nm process. (Side Note: With the next generation of Crucial SSDs, it is very likely we are going to see 2TB SSDs in the 2.5 inch form factor...if you need more than 512 GB - 1 TB, keep your eye out for the 1-2 TB size increase!)<br /><br />Like most SSDs, the smaller-sized drives have considerably lower write speeds than the larger ones (go for at least the 256 GB size if you want to maximize your write speeds.) All three sizes have a read speed of 550MB/s. The 128GB size has a write speed of 150MB/s, the 256GB writes at 330MB/s, and the 512GB writes at 500MB/s. (My usage of the 256GB size has write speeds right around 300 MB/s and read speeds right around 500MB/s, so speeds are very close to as-advertised.) Random read and random write speeds also increase with larger sizes. The lifespan of the drive is advertised at 72 TB...this estimate is likely EXTREMELY conservative. The disk supports various encryption capabilities, including the venerable AES-256. The drive comes with a 3-year warranty from Crucial.<br /><br />Firmware updates are available from Crucial, which allows one to update their firmware using various methods. Over the past few years, their options have become much more flexible (during the M4 era, FW updates on OS X was a difficult process.) Crucial firmware updates generally have direct support for Max OS X, Win 7, and Win 8/8.1.<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />BENCHMARK TESTING AND SSDs<br />Benchmark testing, which is measuring the disk speed in a closed environment, can provide valuable information on hard drive performance. However, there are limitations. One issue is that benchmark performance may or may not translate to similar real-world performance. Another issue is that virtually all modern SSDs are so fast that discussion about what SSD is the fastest is kind of splitting hairs for most users. Finally, benchmark testing on performance tells us very little about the drive's durability, longevity, and wear patterns...and for most users, reliability is probably more desirable than the fastest possible performance. Companies have released some SSDs with the intention of them being 'the fastest', these SSDs received substantial tech media attention, many people bought these products, and eventually it came to light that the reliability was inferior to other products on the market.<br /><br />Crucial SSDs generally do NOT rank among the top of SSDs in benchmark tests. In fact, many benchmark tests make Crucial SSDs appear &#34;slow&#34;. This can be misleading. For actual usage, Crucial SSDs usually give real-world performance that is equal (and sometimes even superior) to many drives that give substantially higher benchmark scores. For example, I have numerous Crucial M4's and an OCZ Vertex 3 from around the same area. The read speeds are pretty similar, but the OCZ benchmarks write speeds about twice that of the M4. In real-world usage, the Crucial M4 works better. It's transfer speeds are more consistent with the Crucial M4, the time it takes to perform most real-world tests favor the M4, and the reliability of the M4 is superior (having had issues with OCZ's SSD reliability, this was the last OCZ SSD I purchased.)<br /><br />The bottom line here is that Crucial drives provide better real-world performance than they do benchmark scores. If real-world performance is more important to you than a numerical benchmark score (like it is for me), don't disqualify Crucial from consideration due to these numerical figures. They do not accurately speak to the quality of the User experience.<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />DURABILITY & RELIABILITY<br />Crucial SSDs are class-leading when it comes to durability and reliability. Like many Samsung & Intel SSDs, Crucial has developed a reputation for reliable flash memory products. You are trusting a company to produce a product that protects your valuable data, and Crucial is a great company to put this trust in.<br /><br />The advertised life of this drive is 72 TB of endurance. In reality, that is probably a very conservative estimate given some Reviewers have tested SSDs beyond the 2 PETABYTE marker (that is, 2,000 TB or 20,000 GB.) If you use this drive to write/read 6.5 GBs of data every day, it would take around 30 years just to reach the 72 TB mark, and this 72 TB mark is likely a small fraction of how long this drive can operate for. In other words, the usable life of the MX100 is going to far exceed the time period it will be technically useful. With a good SSD like this, we are talking some serious durability.<br />--------------------------------<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />The MX100 is not the fastest SSD on the market, but it's still quite fast and capable of tackling many data-heavy tasks. Along with these speeds comes reliability from a company known for reliable and durable flash memory products, and a company that frequently (and promptly) will update their firmware to give you optimal performance, reliability, and security. To make things even better, the MX100 is priced competitively. This MLC drive is less expensive than many TLC drives, and the quality of the MLC flash used in this Crucial is of outstanding quality (as is the controller that manages it.)<br /><br />Since this product provides performance, durability, and value into a single package, it gives the MX100 the versatility to meet a wide range of user needs. Therefore, I highly recommend the Crucial MX100."
AH5Q3Y2QF53XZWWU5ARZNNIZSJZA,B004QJM1HG,1,4,False,"Simply said, I couldn't resist. The reviews here on Amazon and all other sites where reviews are submitted by owners were pretty poor on this product but the speeds that people were reporting were just unreal. Reviewers bragged about it and so I went for it. A week went well and then, nothing. By nothing I mean it just outright died. I own a variety of SSDs and this is the only one to have done this. Well, I now know why this product has such poor reviews relative to the Intel and Crucial alternatives and that is because of the quality. Yes, it was fast as could be, but too many people report outright failures for me to continue using this drive for any useful data and so that little bit of extra speed has absolutely no value given that you are sacrificing reliability. The other reviews show that my outright drive failure was not an isolated incident. Your own results may vary, but I would advise that you take the user reviews more seriously than I did. I am one person, so don't take my word on it...look at all of the reviews as they will speak for themselves. Continuous negative reviews indicate some serious QC issues with the Vertex line. I don't know what I was thinking but I will not make the same mistake twice!"

The one that came with the Dell was a Qualcomm 802.11AC ""Killer"" card and it never worked.  I had bought the Dell last August and never noticed the problem because I connected an Ethernet cable to the laptop as it sits next to my router.  However, I recently took the laptop on a trip and found out that the Qualcomm card didn't work at all; it could not pick up WiFi signals in hotels and elsewhere and couldn't hold the signal for more than a minute or two.<br /><br />The Intel card, on the other hand, works perfectly.  The only problem is installing it is not particularly easy.  I watched a couple of YouTube videos of experts changing out the existing network card with the Intel in a few minutes.  But, I didn't find it that easy.  For one thing, the central screw in the middle of the Dell (behind the security flap) didn't come out easily. I went through five different screwdrivers before I was able to remove it with some brute force.  Then, the network cables didn't easily fit back on the Intel card (I'm old and my hands had difficulty maneuvering the extremely small connectors).  Still, after a good hour, I did get the new card installed.<br /><br />In short, I'm extremely happy with this card.  It works.  Thanks to all those who recommended this card."

Sadly, this has been probably the most annoying and temperamental build that I've put together in the 20 plus years I've had the pleasure of building systems for clients. I'm embarrassed to be perfectly honest, because after reading and watching reviews on the Ryzen platform I hyped this build up to my client and now I'm stuck trying to fix it by getting another board/brand.<br /><br />Started off with a no-boot issue. No display, no post, just a red CPU light on the mobo solid lit. Researched BIOS updates and found that this board has a special USB port a button to make it ""future proof"" to allow for new Ryzen releases.<br /><br />The documentation and how-to was completely lacking on MSI's site, so I ended up like any good technician, browsing YouTube. Found a couple people who had some success using the Flashback feature to load the latest BIOS (v18) from the MSI site.<br /><br />This worked, sort of. I was able to post once after the BIOS was flashed (with basically NO confirmation via lights or audio tone that it had finished). Managed to get to the BIOS and adjusted a few simple settings. Rebooted, and nothing. Had to reset the CMOS. This time, booted and choose factory defaults. Was able to reboot (not power off) and install Windows 10 from my USB drive. Installed drivers, updates, Windows, etc.<br /><br />Rebooted after drivers, no problem.<br /><br />Powered the system down, unplugged the power, waited about a minute. Powered it back on and $!@$%, red CPU light on solid. No display, no post, nothing.

I just kind of auto-specced the old sticks, and it turned out to run at 3200Mhz CL22, which is not great.<br /><br />All I needed to do was shove the two sticks in the #2 slots on my board, then tell my system in BIOS to use the XMP profile. Booted no problem, tested with some basic benchmarking, and no problems with stability.<br /><br />As to what is under those heat sinks, it looks like its dual rank Hynix CJR modules (which I understand is pretty good for enthusiast overclocking). XMP at CL 16-19-19-39 is very stable from what I can tell. I am just going to keep it at XMP for the time being and call it a day personally.<br /><br />Original July 2022<br />Edit August 2022:<br />Ive had a chance to try and manually tune the sticks for better performance. The original stock XMP is 16-19-19-19-39. I tried to set the sticks to 16-18-18-18-38 and I am able to boot the system (after some auto-training done by my mobo), however, the system becomes unstable and crashes within an hour or two, especially if I do something intensive. It looks like the sticks I got are unable to be tuned for any improvement at all. Its rock solid at the stock XMP settings though. I confirmed its fine via some memory benchmarking, along with just using my system for both gaming and other everyday tasks for multiple days with no issues related to RAM at all. I did also manage to run Memtest86 at stock XMP, and I can confirm that the set of sticks I got are in perfect order, no errors at all (which is expected of brand new sticks).<br /><br />Edit: End of August 2022:<br />I have to change my score from 5 to 3 because I did some troubleshooting with my system. Ive had issues in the past with RAM and compatibility with my 3700X. I noticed that I am getting random shutdowns out of the blue of my entire system. The behavior is eerily similar to when I was having issues with RAM timings before. I updated my BIOS for my mobo to the most recent version, it did help with some stability, at least for gameplay, but I dont think it helped with my stability with my RAM. After messing with a bunch of things, it looks like its the DOCP/XMP profile for the RAM. The 16-19-19-39 at 3600Mhz is too much for the memory controller on my 3700X. Zen 2 is known for having issues with RAM compatibility and stability. To avoid random shutdowns, I am now just running the sticks at the default JDEC base spec, 2133Mhz. I did find that it seems to run OK at 3200Mhz C22 (with my mobo auto setting the timings). At this point, I am fed up with my 3700X. The issues with RAM are infuriating. I have a 5800X3D in the mail right now. I am hoping that Zen 3 has had their memory controllers improved significantly over Zen 2 so I can finally just set XMP and call it a day. As a side note, AMD is not the only one that has had issues with memory controllers of their CPUs (AMD 3000 series is known for problems with high frequency DDR4), Intel has recently been found to have problems too (Intel 12th gen is having problems with high frequency DDR5). This pair of sticks is shown to be compatible with my mobo and CPU combo by both G.Skill and Asus officially, but it seems like AMD dropped the ball with some very weak memory controllers on their 3000 series CPUs (they also got in trouble with over-advertising their clock frequencies for the 3000 series), so, if you are getting this for a 3600, 3700X, 3900X, etc, be wary, there isnt a guarantee it will work with absolutely no problems. I may update later on how these sticks of RAM are like with a 5800X3D in my TUF X570 Plus WiFi. I am relegating my 3700X to be used in the future for a home server PC and pairing it with a B550 board and some pedestrian 3200Mhz DDR4."
AH6T5DRW6QNXM6SQEG744W5QDA7Q,B093DNV47J,5,15,True,"I noticed that there is nothing but a glut of reviews for the XPG S70 Blade for PS5 use, but very few actual reviews for use in PCs. I bought this as mainly a game drive for my rig. Overall, its a very nice speedy PCIe 4.0 SSD that is at a killer price (as of late 2021).<br /><br />(first test I did was using CrystalDiskMark v6, I updated and the results make more sense with v8, please disregard this upcoming paragraph) You can see the quick test that I did with CrystalDiskMark, 6800 sequential read, 6400 sequential write. The more reasonable expectation is the Q8T8 values in real world use. This is with the most recent firmware as well, fresh install, it was completely empty. Its pretty off from the ""max"" 7400 read claimed by ADATA, thats a whole SATA SSD's speed in difference.<br /><br />Considering that I built my PC with an Intel 660p 2TB, the Q8T8 speeds are the same as my sequential speeds on the 660p. This is a great improvement. The 660p has a dynamic cache, so it becomes noticeably slower as it fills up. From tests, I see that it starts slowing down once it hits a little past 50% full, the speed decrease is noticeable at 2/3 full, once you get to 75-80% full, it becomes as slow as an HDD. The S70 Blade came with the most recent firmware already loaded on it, which was a pleasant surprise.<br /><br />Just to let people know, even though this is a significantly faster SSD, it doesnt actually improve load speeds by a huge amount. It does make a measurable improvement, but it might shave a second or so off of game load times at most compared to a PCIe3.0 m.2. At these speeds, you are more limited by the power of your CPU, where its a struggle to actually saturate the pipeline for the SSD when it comes to game loading. I got this mostly to give my PC a dedicated gaming SSD that doesnt care about how full it is (keep 10% or more free on any drive so it has room to work in general), so I can just cram all of my game installs (at least all the games I currently play) over on this drive (I have just under 900 games in my Steam library). The PS5 has a 5500MB read speed minimum to completely overkill the required spec needed for a seamless experience, as the crowd that tend to use consoles tend to be less technically savvy and have shallower wallets, so it at least somewhat covers the bases to make sure things work.<br /><br />One thing to note, I did get the drive with a chipped heatsink. There was a small chip on the bottom side of it, which had jagged edges. I fixed it with some sandpaper I had (low grit to get rid of the burs, high grit to polish). Thankfully, the chip in the heatsink was small, and I only really had to smooth out the edges, the chip was also more on the underside of the heatsink as well, so you cant see it when it is applied to the drive.<br /><br />For others that have dealt with m.2 drives, there is something to note. This drive runs warm. Idle temps for me with the included heat spreader are usually at 41C or so, under load (moving my installed Steam library over, approx 800GB), it gets to about 51-52C. This is almost 10C higher than my 660p (my 660p does have an integrated mobo heatsink on it, its just a slab of aluminum, no fins). If you plan on using this drive for heavy writing, I highly recommend getting a better aftermarket cooler for it, or at the very minimum, ensure that you have good airflow. Reading from an SSD wont put very much heat load on it. I understand that SSDs do not like going above 65C, where they start thermal throttling.<br /><br />Besides that, the important information for PC users is as follows:<br /><br />Ensure that you are installing it in a PCIe 4.0 m.2 slot, and that slot has been set for PCIe4.0! Theres no point in spending extra on a 4.0 drive if you cant use the speed.<br /><br />Make sure you use at least the included heatsink, this drive runs warm. If you plan on getting an aftermarket heatsink, the 2TB S70 Blade has storage chips on both sides, make sure you get a heatsink that can fit that.<br /><br />This drive does not come with mounting hardware. Your mobo should have come with a standoff and a securing screw for each of your m.2 slots.<br /><br />(Original 11/25/21) Edit (11/28/21): I ran an updated Crystal Disk Mark test using v8. I noticed I was using the older v6 I had when I first built my rig. The numbers make more sense, it shows the advertised 7400 read for peak performance, the IOPs also seem to line up with what a few SSD reviews got as well. The other result is for the ""Real World"" test, that number is lower, since real world use rarely lines up perfectly with what memory controllers are best at handling."
AH6T5DRW6QNXM6SQEG744W5QDA7Q,B07WP6M7P7,5,3,True,"If you check the tests and reviews of this cooler, you can see that it is one of the best performing AIOs on the market. If you are buying one right now for an AMD AM4 mount, its a bit of a pain to install due to the lack of proper instructions or any documentation whatsoever that is included with the kit.<br /><br />I swapped out my Noctua NH-D14 Black Edition with the Arctic Liquid Freezer II 280, mainly due to the fact that I was fed up with the dealing with the massive tower being in the way whenever I wanted to do maintenance, clean, or upgrade my system. You cannot reach anything with a massive tower cooler installed, and its a pain to remove it. I used to be an air cooler guy, preferring simplicity and reliability, but ive changed my mind since a few years ago when I built my last system. Air coolers are great for the reasons I stated before, but should only really be used if the system you are building is rarely if ever going to be taken apart, maintenanced, or upgraded.<br /><br />Arctic added a special offset mounting option for 3000 and 5000 series AM4 CPUs, it apparently better positions the cold plate and shaves an extra 2-3 degrees off your temps. Be warned that the offset is not able to be used for all mobos, some mobos dont have the room to enable you to install it. The more common issue you might run into, is the offset installation, you will need to ensure that the top M.2 slot is empty, else the drive will get in the way during installation. Once you get the mount installed, you can reinstall your M.2.<br /><br />Arctic needs to work on their documentation. They have just a couple bags of assorted screws and other things, with no instruction booklet, or even anything marking what parts are what. It was a pain to find any kind of guide to install the thing, or even what the heck I was looking at (Arctic has their own proprietary mounting system). The current official instructional video is worthless, and also does not note the new way to mount for AM4. The official site also does not give clear instructions on how to install the thing.<br /><br />To help, if you are planning on installing this on an AM4 using the offset mounting, there are a couple things you want to get started. Keep the OEM mobo backplate, you are going to use that. Remove the plastic bars where the OEM cooler clips on to start. it may be a pain to get started with the installation, thankfully, the new revision of the cooler has a simplified way to install the mounting hardware. look for the bag that contains 4 longer screws and 4 white plastic tubes, those are the replacements for the former standoffs that require you to grow an extra arm to install things. For the board side of the mounting assembly, you want the two pieces that have the threaded pegs on their ends, the normal mounting will have the curved piece up top, and the flat bottom piece below. It will look like a ""D"" with the curved side upwards. This is to mount it with the VRM fan up top (which is the way it is intended for the offset mounting). The plastic tubes will be your standoffs, you will use the long screws in the set of holes above if you want to use the offset, the bottom holes are for standard mounting if you have a non 3000 or 5000 series AMD CPU or an Intel. The bowed long pieces are going to be installed on your pump, they will be bowed outwards on the sides, install them with the concave side towards the mobo to give room for the screw head, using the pair of long screws in your bag of parts. You can then attach the pump using the 4 thumbscrews in the kit. The vast majority of screws and other things included are not going to be used.<br /><br />So, to install on a 3000 or 5000 series AMD CPU for AM4, you need the original OEM backplate that came with your mobo, the set of 4 long screws and their matching plastic tubes as the standoffs, and the pair of bars with the threaded poles for the board side of the mounting hardware. For the pump side, you need the pair of bowed bars with the pair of long screws to attach it. paste the CPU, remove the protective sticker from the pump plate, then just install it using the 4 thumb screws (using a screwdriver) torque it so its very solidly tightened, but dont try to compete with a gorilla, else you might snap something.<br /><br />The offset will make it so the coldplate will actually only partially cover the CPU IHS, a part of the plate will be hanging off, and a part of the IHS wont be contacted at all, but dont worry about that, its by design.<br /><br />You may want to also know that there is no separate pump header. Everything runs off of a single fan header, which simplifies things, but makes it impossible to control the pump speed, the pump speed is permanently tied to your fan speed.<br /><br />This is being used in a Fractal S2 as front intake. My system has a R7 3700X and a RX 5700XT Red Devil. I installed it using some MX5 i had lying around, not the small packet of MX4 included with the kit. It is seriously impressive. I have it set to run at 800RPM till my CPU hits 50C, it then jumps instantly to 1200RPM and ramps to max at 75C. This way, it only ramps up when under serious load, and I will still have good air intake to my case no matter what the temp of the CPU. To test, I blasted my CPU with CPU Burner and ran Furmark for a good 15+ minutes to see what the worst possible thermal situation is. I was sitting pretty at a max of 68C for my CPU junction temp when everything is going full throttle for an extended period of time. This is compared to my 75C max junction temp with my giant Noctua NH-D15 installed with NT-H1 paste.<br /><br />The Arctic Freezer II 280mm (current production version in late 2021) is THE option to get if you are looking for a no-frills best bang-for-your-buck AIO. It is seriously one of the best AIOs performance wise for the noise. There technically are options that can keep your CPU cooler by a couple degrees, but they do so by having their fans go at insane RPM, creating much more noise. Apparently, one of the major reasons why this AIO is so good, is because it has a THICC radiator, far larger than the standard fare of Asetek AIOs like anything made by Corsair, NZXT, or EVGA, combined with some of the best fans on the market."
AH6T5DRW6QNXM6SQEG744W5QDA7Q,B0035K6H2C,5,3,True,"very nice card, I can play most games at my monitor's max res very smoothly(1280x1024), though at times i need to adjust the quality for games like Fallout 3, where it still has noticeably choppy framerates when im out in the open with everything set to ultra, but i imagine part of the blame for inconsistent framerates is due to the buggy nature of the game in the first place since its such a massive game. I play TF2, on very high settings, super smooth, its a VERY noticeable improvement over my integrated Radeon HD 4290.<br /><br />a few things that i have to complain about are driver issues and somewhat inconsistent performance as far as i can tell. ATI still has not figured out how to make the card work perfectly, which is indicated by video card crashes that cause my computer to freeze. though to be fair, the only time i have had the problem is with L4D2, it just wont let me play the game, the moment i enter a game, i get a grey screen with different shades of grey and brown vertical bars, and the sound freezes and dies after about 5 seconds, there is no way around the screen, and ctrl+alt+del doesnt work either. its also weird because i can play L4D1 perfectly fine since it uses the same graphics engine. I have been looking around online and apparently its a common problem, having the cards crash randomly with little or no reason, i have heard that ATI has been continually trying to fix the problems but apparently, they havent squashed all the bugs yet, at least as far as i can tell the only real problems left are when you do 3d, like playing games, where it would just refuse to work correctly on rare occasions.<br /><br />overall i think it is a great card that is well worth the money, plus its not nearly as huge as some of the more high end cards out there right now, so it will fit in your case much more easily. oh, and its pretty good for overclocking as well, since its quite good at keeping its temp down, I run my card at 950mhz with mem clock at 1400mhz.<br /><br />bit of an unrelated note, i dont know why, but they decided to paste a picture of an ugly chick on the card itself, putting a picture of a humanoid character on a graphics card is just plain creepy in my opinion... though its not a big deal since my card is about an inch above my PSU, making it impossible to see it.<br /><br />UPDATE4/5/2011: so far the 5770 is still holding out quite strong, the only problems I have really run into are odd framerate problems in Batman: Arkham Asylum, where the benchmark FPS maxes out at 18, and it goes even lower if I lower the settings for some odd reason. the other problem is not related to the card, my processor and RAM are actually the bottleneck in my system, im waiting for 2 more sticks of RAM in the mail, and Im just plain stuck with my budget processor for now. It will handle most games I throw at it with relative ease with smooth framerates at med-high graphics settings (with no AA, AA is pointless anyways and inhales resources), though it does tend to slow down when I max out the settings especially for games that are poorly ported to the PC, like BF:BC2 and Borderlands(certain large maps have FPS drops due to inefficient rendering). I expect this card to be fully able to play games at respectable graphics settings with smooth FPS rates at the very least for the next year or two. well worth the money in my opinion.<br /><br />Build:<br />[[ASIN:B003964KK8 ASUS M4A89GTD PRO/USB3 - AM3 - AMD 890GX - DDR3 - USB 3.0 SATA 6 Gb/s - ATX Motherboard]]<br />[[ASIN:B003M7BLOW AMD Athlon II X4 640 Propus 3.0 GHz 4x512 KB L2 Cache Socket AM3 95W Quad-Core Processor - Retail ADX640WFGMBOX]]<br />[[ASIN:B002LE8D2A Corsair 4GB Dual Channel Corsair DDR3 Memory for Intel Core i5 Processors (CMX4GX3M2A1600C9)]]<br />[[ASIN:B0035K6H2C Sapphire Radeon HD 5770 1 GB DDR5 2DVI/HDMI/DisplayPort PCI-Express Video Card 100283-3L]]<br />[[ASIN:B001MTYS06 OCZ OCZ550FTY Fatal1ty Series 550W Power Supply]]<br />[[ASIN:B000Q82PIQ Western Digital Caviar Blue 500 GB Bulk/OEM Hard Drive 3.5 Inch, 16 MB Cache, 7200 RPM SATA II WD5000AAKS]]<br />[[ASIN:B003E474NA Thermaltake V5 Black Edition Mid-Tower Gaming Chassis VL70001W2Z (Black)]]<br />[[ASIN:B002SIMPXM Lite-On LightScribe 24X SATA DVD+/-RW Dual Layer Drive IHAS424-98 - Retail (Black)]]"

While it's not perfect, it's quite incredible for its price. There will always be some tasks done more efficiently on my desktop, this gives me the ability to get much of my work done from my recliner: not a trivial matter when limited by health.<br /><br />Some things are quite noteworthy. The  keyboard is a comfortable size, and it's arranged intelligently. They keys are responsive, and the trackpad works well. I like that it's so thin, too, yet it doesn't feel flimsy. The whole, when the keyboard is folded closed, is still remarkably thin. I haven't a lot of experience with convertibles, but it separates into its components without great difficulty once you try it a couple of times--but it feels like it's built to last. It doesn't swing in a wide arc, due to it's magnetic hinge assembly, but I don't find that to be a major irritation. If that changes I'll try to edit this review. Even with the keyboard on, it's easy to use the touch functions as though it were just a tablet. The screen has good color and definitely adequate resolution. I haven't done any serious photo editing on it as that's a function that will be better performed on my desktop, but I haven't felt any lack when it comes to photo viewing on it. I like its weight, and find myself carrying the whole around most of the time.<br /><br />No, for its price it doesn't come with MS Office, but I'm generally happy with the freeware office products out there--but if you want to pay for your office software, be my guest.

During that time, we've had two power outages/interruptions.  In both cases, everything else in the rooms went dark, but the computers and monitors stayed on and we had time to save the work and shut off the systems.  Have to admit I was wondering if they'd really work, but they did!  (I don't have them set up to automatically shut down applications; that just seems too complex and unnecessary to me).  Of course, they are kind of expensive, when compared with the usual power strips and surge protectors, but you get what you pay for.  The cost of replacing/repairing motherboards or losing critical work in progress shouldn't be discounted.  Having seen them deliver results in a black-out situation, I would never use a computer for important work without them.<br /><br />I thought about getting one of the larger versions (1000, 1350) but didn't see the point.  There are so many things you can't plug into these units - space heaters, printers, copiers, etc. - that they're basically just for computers and monitors.  It seems like the small 850 model handles my robust Intel i5 systems with 23"" and 24"" IPS monitors and various external disks and whatnot, with ease and lots of extra headroom.  Each system is using (according to the LED display on the CP850) about 125 watts, while the unit is rated for 510 watts.

Both use the same Intel Quark processor, so it provides a way of playing around with the possibilities for the Edison before it makes its debut. I found the setup to be much more involved than an Arduino board. The Galileo requires a firmware upgrade when you get it. That process took me a bit to get it to function correctly and actually do the upgrade. The other issue is that the development IDE does not &#34;add&#34; to an existing Arduino IDE, so you are best off installing it with a different name (like Galileo) or risk overwriting your Arduino IDE (if you have one installed) and losing things that you may have installed there. The Quark processor runs amazingly hot compared to any other micro-controller I have used. (I can't wait to see how the Edison runs, especially if Intel is pushing it as a wearable platform. I am thinking it could cause some serious skin burns!) The other issues are the funky serial interface that uses a 1/8&#34; audio jack and the lack of a video connection capability.

AEDCV4NUVAUG6JO3TNWZURAAORXA,B07TZKYXW6,5,1,True,"The motherboard on my six-year-old desktop died recently.  After consulting with my son and two computer techs, we decided it wasn’t worth fixing.  My son said it would cost as much to rebuild as to buy a refurbished computer from Amazon.  I had a good experience recently buying a refurbished smartphone from Amazon, so decided to try it.<br /><br />PROS: I am very happy with the purchase of this refurbished HP EliteDesk 800.  It started up great right out of the box.  It runs very quietly.  It has the amount of hard drive (223 GB SSD and 3 TB HDD) and RAM (16 GB) as advertised.  The Intel I-7 is a step up from my previous desktop and is quite fast.  Windows 10 Professional works quite well on this machine.  It has a lot more USB ports, both 2.0 and 3.0, than my previous machine.  I like that it doesn’t come with all the “bloat” software that normally would come with an HP computer as I prefer to load my own software (I became very proficient at this with my last desktop, as the Windows 8 to 10 transition kept crashing it).<br /><br />CONS: It doesn’t come already wi-fi enabled.  Some of the reviews and Q&A’s do mention this fact.  (It would be nice if it was mentioned in the product description.) There is a troubleshooting chart that comes with the computer, which is helpful.  I thought I would have to call the help desk, but I solved the wi-fi issue by myself without calling for help.  I already had an external USB Linksys wi-fi adapter for my last computer.  All I had to do was go on my laptop to the Linksys web site to download the wi-fi driver to a stick drive.  Once I did that, I was able to transfer that to the new desktop and enable the wi-fi adapter.  The HP computer does have an Ethernet port, so that is another option for connecting to the internet (and downloading a wi-fi driver if needed).  That is what I probably would have done if I didn’t have the option to download the needed driver with another computer.<br /><br />TAKEAWAY:  If you are comfortable setting up your own desktop, definitely consider a refurbished model.  It would have cost me more than twice as much to buy a brand-new one with the specifications of my old one.  Instead I got a much better machine for a lot less money.  (Just to be safe, though, I also purchased the 3-year protection plan from Asurion.)  I am hoping for at least that many years of service from it—we’ll see!<br /><br />NOTE: If you are not technically savvy or don’t have a “geek” to help you, you might want to avoid a refurbished one and just buy a brand-new desktop."

I wanted to have a dual monitor setup and I had an empty PCIe slot, so I figured I'd get a graphics card. My main monitor was VGA and I was hoping to get the 2nd (an old monitor I brought from work so I could work from home during the COVID-19 pandemic) into HDMI. Got the card inserted into the slot and powered everything back up. BLACK SCREEN!!! Not even the integrated graphics VGA worked! I had no clue what to do! I powered down, took the graphics card back out and was able to see via the VGA again.<br /><br />The product did not come with a cd for the driver, so I went to the NVIDIA website to download it. Got the .exe going, but it wouldn't let me run the install wizard because it couldn't detect the card. (Nooo duhhh...because I had to take the card out to even SEE how to get to the website to download the driver!!!) Only the integrated graphics showed up under display in Device Manager.<br /><br />I thought that maybe my HDMI cable was bad so I tested them out with the laptop. They worked great. Turns out the old monitor from work was no good. Back to the drawing board. I scoured tons of forums for solutions and pored over them for hours.<br /><br />One solution was to boot up in safe mode and enable the PCIe slot in BIOS. So, I go to BIOS and there is absolutely NOTHING about graphics, video interface, northbound or southbound (or whatever it is) settings...NOTHING. Spent about an hour trying to read up on BIOS and where else it could possibly be. Couldn't find a thing. So I decided to look up if I should update my BIOS. After all, I was running version A04. I got conflicting answers about whether or not I should - this did not really help me at all.<br /><br />I tried to find out how I could even update the BIOS...I didn't know where to go. My search led me to Dell's website, where I input the service code of my pc and it showed me about 11 different updates it needed to do - one of which was a BIOS marked URGENT! Matter of fact, it was wanting to update to BIOS version A11!!! No WONDER I was having trouble! Intel's website told me, if I understood it correctly,  that I could not use an external graphics card in addition to the integrated graphics card...that only one would be active. That bummed me out because in order to make the graphics card fit, I had to take off the VGA port and install it with the smallest bracket, which only left me with HDMI and DVI. I was hoping to use the integrated VGA and the HDMI on the new graphics card.<br /><br />Solution: I updated my BIOS to the latest version, enabled Intel Multi-Display in BIOS, and was then able to continue the NVIDIA control panel installation, which enabled my new graphics card. I was also able to use the integrated VGA AND the HDMI on the new graphics card with no trouble! Hopefully, this poor sap is able to help another poor sap out. :)<br /><br />Con: My only con (other than the legwork required for me to install it - but that is most likely due to my pc being old) is that the fan is noisier than I expected."

I will include an edit at a later date but had to put this out there as soon as I was positive that this is the most regretful (albeit highly researched) purchase I have ever made in my entire life.<br /><br />update: 06/18/14<br />  Recently I dropped my Rukus down an entire flight of stairs. The good new is, it didn't break. The bad news is, it didn't break.<br /><br />  For a fleeting flash of a moment, I felt something other than regret with this purchase. That feeling was relatively short lived.<br />  Shortly after this experience I had to pair the unit and listen to it, and was immediately reminded of what a sub standard gimmick this indestructible piece of plastic is. While one can argue that durability is a great thing, I would counter that, that item should do what it is SUPPOSED to do well, first. The Rukus, in my opinion, is SUPPOSED to play music, it does that, albeit very badly.<br />  You wouldn't buy an expensive pen if it didn't write, even though by it's very nature it's still good at poking things and potentially stabbing someone in self defense. It is SUPPOSED to write, first, then, secondly at best and by very nature, be an implement of danger and/or mischievous probing.<br />  Let's cover things that one might ASSUME an item like this would do, as most contemporary/comparable/class of items do, without notice.<br /><br />  First off, it should realistically detect when:<br /><br />  a) a device is plugged into the accessory port<br />  b) a device is plugged into the usb port<br />  c) sense when it is in sunlight and subsequently charge<br />  d) charge<br />  e) have a volume level display/indicator that is visible in the Sunlight (where it could be assumed to be likely utilized)<br /><br />  It does none of these.<br /><br />  Let me address the issue of charging, first.<br /><br />  Even in DIRECT sunlight, it will NOT charge a separate device, as it states it will. To be specific, it will transfer the available charge from the internal (non-replaceable) battery to your device while displaying a ""Charging"" (Solar) symbol on the display. Charging an external device continuously, in direct sunlight, without using the device to play music, will completely drain the unit in about 4hrs. This was in heavy SE US Summer sun. I doubt the results would be any difference in some equatorial latitude that could theoretically receive more solar energy.<br />  As far as I can see the panel is only THEORETICALLY capable of facilitating continuous play in full, direct sunlight. THIS IS ONLY facilitated by the unit restricting volume to about 60% when it is removed from AC (Wall, plugged in) power. That's not too bad really, considering any volume over that level sounds absolutely awful and becomes nearly unintelligible.<br /><br />I will continue to update this review, as there is much more to say/detail."

AHDHJIX6PJWHFKSYNWBBLHRXACCA,B0080ATR2Y,4,0,True,"I picked this up for the HTPC upgrade I was building.  It works well, and cools decently (though this is only on a A10 APU, which dissipates 100W max) and is low profile enough to fit in my HTPC with no clearance issues.  The base isn't perfectly polished and on the heat pipes especially there's marks deep enough to catch with a fingernail, but at the levels I'm running it at this doesn't appear to be an issue.<br /><br />It is fiddly to install, however.  It's a very light heat sink, but they still make you mount it with screws through the motherboard into a metal base plate.  You also have to install tiny screws into little metal arms then secure it with more screws through the motherboard.  Make sure you have a good selection of screwdrivers before starting.<br /><br />I think this is overkill and easily could have come with brackets to fit on to the AM3/FM1/FM2 socket clips that came with the motherboard without putting overly much strain on the board... but perhaps this was the cheapest option they could come up with and still be compatible with the Intel style socket mounts."

AGDPHDIKTSUGLGDBAQKPTAA66R6A,B0BJKCZX3L,5,1,False,"Wow!  Where to begin with this thing?  For some background, I'm a PC enthusiast and regularly build my own rigs.  I hadn't seen these Intel NUC PCs before so I jumped on the chance to try one out.<br /><br />Form Factor:<br /><br />There's so much to like here!  First off, the form factor is TINY.  I included a picture; this basically sits in the palm of my hand, and I don't have very big hands.  From a power perspective, this means you're going to get an external power brick with the device, which probably adds 25% more to the size of the package all-in, but this can be stored away under your desk.<br /><br />Hardware:<br /><br />From the headline, you can see you get a Core i5, 32GB of RAM, and a 512 GB SSD.<br /><br />This has Bluetooth and WiFi built in (there's a very small antenna you screw in to enhance reception.), so no need for a CAT3 cable (though it has a port for wired network connections).  The WiFi performance was excellent; I was able to reach the full 400Mbps that internet plan allows for.<br /><br />In addition to the power cord, you get what appears to be a 2"" HDMI cable.  You also get a mounting plate which you can use to mount this thing in an array of other NUC PCs.  That's it - you need to supply all other peripherals, such as the keyboard and mouse.<br /><br />Since these are kit computers in a sense, I opened one up to see inside.  From the included picture you can see everything that can be swapped, specifically the new series of NVm.2 style SSDs.  I didn't realize it at first, but there's an entire tray at the bottom for a SATA SSD, and there's actually a removable slot that allows you to run a SATA cord from an external device IN to this device, so you don't actually physically need to put the drive in.  Very clean and straightforward insides here, they didn't try to cram everything in so there's airflow.<br /><br />Performance:<br /><br />This isn't going to be a performance review - I don't have the testing equipment and such to run any meaningful side-by-side comparisons.<br /><br />However, the Intel iRISx graphics card is decent - to give you a sense of what it has, the Nvidia RTX 3080 with 8GB I have in my gaming rig has about 3x the double precision processing power (among other things).  But that card cost more than this entire computer.<br /><br />From a gaming perspective the performance here is what I would consider to be ""nominal.""  I downloaded the Steam client on this and benchmarked Steel Division 2, which is the sort of game where you can really crank the settings depending on your hardware.  Again on my 3080, I can run the highest settings in every category on an ultrawide 49"" 1440p monitor.  With this PC, I had to run almost all the lowest settings, with several off, to play the same game at 1080p - but it was still completely playable.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a gaming rig, you're probably better off getting an XBox or a PS5.  But those two aren't computers, like this is.<br /><br />Other:<br /><br />Sound-wise, this is quiet but not silent.  My current gaming build - a NZXT 510 Elite with 4 fans and a PSU are actually quieter, but this is just a low-level whir, similar to what you'd get out of a laptop (except with better internal airflow).<br /><br />This PC does generate heat - even with good cool airflow nearby and the fans whirring, you can feel the ports in the back getting hot (indicative of internal temperatures).<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />I continue to be amazed by the offerings out there these days.  When I was younger, you had to have a huge tower to get this level of performance.  This is just like a big Alexa puck.  The form factor gives it all sorts of use potential beyond a simple desktop, while still allowing for plenty of expansion.<br /><br />From a price perspective, you really end up getting a lot (right now this item is listed at $780).  Considering you're getting an i5, plus 32GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, the only thing separating this from a higher end gaming rig is a discrete graphics card.  You also get a paid-up version of Windows 11.<br /><br />Very happy overall I was able to snag this product - I hope you find this review to be helpful!"

The battery is fine, I unplug the unit from the wall and it beeps and stays on, however if the power surges just a tad (I live in Florida we have daily thunderstorms in the summer) it would shut my computer off VERY frustrating, but this 425 unit has the other computer just fine. I'm never buying a fancy LCD screen on my blackout buster again!<br /><br />UPDATE: Less than 3 weeks of owning, it has already come in handy. So let me start by saying my previously owned: CyberPower CP1000AVRLCD Intelligent LCD Series UPS 1000VA 600W AVR Mini-Tower, had issues with power surges causing the unit to restart. Lightning struck and we lost power this week for roughly 15 seconds, my computer stayed on and I was about continue playing my video game. Thank you battery backup unit! I like these units so much I also have my TV and cable box on it, so when the power flickers we don't have to wait 5 minutes for the cable box to reconnect.<br /><br />I haven't had the power go out yet, but I feel confident living in Tampa Bay, where I get short 'brown outs' that my computer will stay alive, now if I just bought 1 of these things for my modem and router."

I love this laptop, especially because I'm coming from using a Panasonic Toughbook which had miserable screen resolution, and was essentially a giant dinosaur in an armor shell.<br /><br />I can't give much helpful insight about how this Acer Predator Helios 300 compares to other gaming computers (or really other computers period, except for a Toughbook), but I love everything about it (except for the battery life).  I've now had this for 15 months, and the battery only lasts about 1 hour (or 1:30) on a full charge, even when just doing office tasks, and not using much CPU.  But I don't make a big deal about batteries because you can always plug it into the wall, or buy another battery.<br /><br />I love the speed of the CPU.  The screen is bright, sharp, and amazing.  I *love* the multi-colored keyboard.  Yes, it's just eye candy, but what can I say?  It's pretty, man!!  I've had no other issues with it (except that the first one of these I purchased, I tried pressing a screen protector onto the screen too hard, and the screen shattered.  I had to buy a second one of these Predators, which I'm now using.)<br /><br />Otherwise, I've had dozens or hundreds of hours of good video editing (Davinci Resolve 16), and the countless other office tasks and things I do with this laptop.  Anyway, very grateful I bought it.<br /><br />Another thing: I'm glad you can upgrade the hard drive and the RAM.  I've upgraded to 32GB of RAM (mainly for video editing), and added a 2TB M.2 harddrive.  Fantastic!  I'm thinking of adding yet another SSD harddrive to the 2.5"" bay.  I think it's great to have those upgradable possibilities.<br /><br />Again, all good things to say (and I'm not incentivized to write this) except for the less-than-impressive battery life."

This MB also has the integrated INTEL GPU on it as well. Everything works, the dedicated GPU does a great job. I had a hard time with the touch pad, I had to really tune it up to get it to work as it almost should.  Upgrading the RAM will be difficult because they say its under the board so have Artic Silver ready to go.I looked for the RAM I didn't see any films. The MB is the weak point in this set up. The touch pad may or may not be a piece of crap. I wish I checked to see what was used with the GT 1070 because that board is pushing a ton of data. Nevertheless, at this point it seems to be a great ride, but I think I hear some raddling under the hood. Intel made the N and S bridge, but who married those two and did the daughter boards came from Transylvania time will only tell. The back lit keyboard is what tipped me in favor of this laptop. I was sold on the 8th gen. i7 but it still burns batteries like they are solid rocket fuel, but I along for the ride I just need to turn off the NVIDIA card to save on gas. Oh my SSD card is on the way, no way I'm dealing with a mechanical 1 Tb hard drive even if it has a Granny Board, she may be gray but she can still rock. Just don't think about it & have a drink."
AGUJREEXOZUK6DQLYDB5DBMVNZGQ,B0042TYYLQ,5,1,False,"This is my second netbook, the first was an Acer that is still operable, but now loaded with Ubuntu instead of Windows XP.  A big part of my purchase decision was price -- $199 at Fry's Electronics.<br /><br />This netbook seems very responsive, much more so than the Acer, which was a single core processor.<br /><br />I plan to use it mainly as a travel computer for trips abroad when I want small size and weight.  I wanted to be able to reach my banks and brokers and e-mail while abroad.  I am not interested in gaming and video isn't that important to me, although so far the video seems fine.<br /><br />It took awhile to set things up but it was all pretty straightforward, including downloading Microsoft Security Essentials and all the Windows updates.  I also put a few security features into my netbook, including a virtual private network (VPN), Sandboxie to lock down the browser.  These had no discernible effect on performance.  I used PCDecrapifier to get rid of some pre-loaded junk software and used MSCONFIG to remove some programs from the auto startup to make things run more smoothly.  Also downloaded the latest BIOS using the ASUS update program.<br /><br />I like the much smaller power block.  That deducted a few ounces and some bulk for travel.<br /><br />The keyboard is just fine, nice tactile response.<br /><br />Windows 7 Starter seems to do anything I have had need to do.  I don't care about customizing the look and I have found the Aero features of Win & Home Premium fine to look at but they exact a performance toll.  I don't miss it.  So far I can't tell that this cheap version of Windows 7 is inadequate for my general uses, so although I had thoughts of ""upgrading"", I decided to save the $70.<br /><br />I was fortunate to have a 2 GB RAM chip taken out of another computer whose RAM I had upgraded that worked with this computer.  Since I added that pretty early on, I can't comment on what it may have done for performance, but in all likelihood it has helped,  ve ever had a computer that didn't run better with more memory and 1 GB is pretty small memory.  The RAM is easily accessible.<br /><br />There is a newer version of this netbook out, but it was about $90 more than I paid for this.  It may be worth it to some folks, but I have an Intel Core i5 laptop which I use for heavy lifting and didn't need or want much more than basic performance here.<br /><br />I also like the pre-loaded owners manual in PDF format.  I prefer a mouse to a touchpad, and the manual made clear how to easily turn off the touchpad, which i had to do to keep from inadvertently making input with the touchpad while using the keyboard and mouse combo.<br /><br />In terms of battery life, after the first charge, I had the computer on from about 8 AM to 10 PM, of which several hours it was in ""Sleep"" mode.  The battery life definitely is better than any other computer I have ever owned.  I have made no change to the default power settings to this point.<br /><br />All in all I am very pleased thus far with a real computer that does more, better and faster than my tablet."

AEIDHAR7OLM62IELUBCSOEFF35KQ,B00006RVPW,2,5,True,"I have a wired and wireless networked SOHO. I used the NS108 to replace a NetGear 10/100 hub that was working fine. The reason for the 'upgrade' is that a month ago I developed a need for large file transfers from 3 computers that were plugged into my hub going down one CAT5 wire to my server room to a NAS box. The problem was the hub was getting almost constant collisions when I'd try and communicate with the NAS simultaneously on more than one computer on the hub. So, I thought swapping the hub out with this switch would solve the problem (I also had 2 other NAS boxes off the hub, and a printer).<br /><br />While the NS108 switch took care of the data collision issue, I've actually seen my network file transfer to the remote NAS box DECREASE versus the hub I had been using. The worst problem I'm encountering with the NS108 is that its method of throttling multiple computers trying to use the same pipe appears to be to dedicate virtually all the bandwidth to the first computer that tries to access the remote NAS box. WTF? That doesn't solve my problem, it makes it worse. Now the situation I end up with is if I try and access the remote NAS with more than one PC at a time, the 2nd and following PC connections hang. Not only that, but those machines can barely (if at all) access the Internet or anything else since the data connection needs to travel from the switch across the same pipe to the server room.<br /><br />I am going to experiment with running at least one more CAT5 line from the GS108 to my server room to see if that helps, but at this point I am very skeptical. I'm annoyed that I can't change the behavior of the switch and that it appears to be optimized to favor a single connection to the switch communicating with a single other connection on the switch. What I wanted was a device that would load balance like my hub but more intelligently handle the traffic in an effort to avoid data collisions like what I was seeing on the hub. Yet what I have now with the GS108 is worse. I didn't get time-outs and apps crashing with the hub, just slower throughput for all connected devices. But that is better than what I have right now, which paralyzes part of my network when a large transfer is initiated from any one device on the switch. Very annoying and counter-productive.<br /><br />I'm now looking at the TP-Link giga switches, which are the only brand I've found so far that supports 10/100/1000 transfer rates on ALL ports for the price."
AHODFCBA47I7SGNJTZV46PSRYI6A,B01BIWN2TY,2,2,True,"The processor I got was defective.  It took me a while to figure it out, because I had to get another motherboard, which I thought might be defective, and then another.  And then find someone with a processor I could try.  Eventually, I determined it was the processor that was defective.  Yes, the MB did support it, and I had the right BIOS.  The processor was bad.<br /><br />This took a bit over 30 days, maybe a week.  The seller refused to take the return, and instead directed me to call AMD.  They gave me a non-working number there.  Defective processors are quite rare, so I doubt it's a big problem for AMD.  But, get it from a different company.  These guys not only don't support what they sell, but they also give bad information to contact the company.  So, they're not a great choice.<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />AMD sent me a replacement processor and it worked.  It was still too slow, so I just bit the bullet and bought an Intel i3-6100T.  These processors are fine for very simple things, but anything more and you're going to want something faster.  They are cheap, and don't use a lot of power, but the performance is frustrating at times.  Other times it's fine, but it's never crisp.  I'd avoid these and Intel's Atoms for anything more than very simple computer use; even certain websites made it very slow.<br /><br />Intel's Pentium (based on Haswell or Skylake, not the Atom-based ones) are going to be better for the vast majority of people though, and they're fairly cheap as well.  I only bought the i3-6100t for the very low power use, not the performance."

On the Seasonic PSU, I keep the fan running all the time because it seems to get very warm in fanless mode. It probably does not help that I have it mounted sideways in an O11 Evo case.

AHKXALUNUHQHOXRGGGBINGV5LIEQ,B087ZNP8FL,4,1,False,"I have been using this laptop for a couple of months now, and overall I'm happy for the price. I had 3 complete duds in other brands before I settled on this model, so the fact that it worked at all was a huge plus. This was my last ""possibles"" model when doing my research, so I was stoked that it worked out.<br /><br />I will say that I think the quality of laptops in this price range have upped their processor game but have lost quality in other areas. I don't see this laptop lasting 5-7 years like my last one, but for the price, I suppose you can't expect but so much.<br /><br />Here's what I've found so far:<br /><br />Pros:<br />12 GB of RAM for under $700 (Paid about $650 at a Best Buy sale)<br />Lightning fast booting and seamless app loading and switching between programs<br />No bloatware. I think I maybe uninstalled like two things after setting it up. A vast improvement for me. Used to take hours.<br />SSD (this may not be considered an extra but it's the first laptop I've owned with it, so I'm including it)<br />Ryzen 7 processor - first time deviating from Intel and am pretty impressed.<br />Lightweight for its size - I can tote it around my apartment with one hand, and it's definitely heavier than smaller models but it weighs less than my last one for sure.<br />Screen is just fine for what I use it for. I mostly connect to a separate monitor, but I have watched TV shows and movies on it and though it's not going to blow you away, I didn't notice any issues that distract from the content.<br /><br />Standards:<br />Battery life is fine as far as I can tell. I primarily use a laptop this big at home, so it is plugged in a lot of the time and I rarely need it for carry with me portability, but it hasn't died on me yet and I've used it for a couplefew hours at a time without it getting low.<br />It's a 17 inch, so there's a separate keypad, which I usually need and is standard on these larger laptops.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Trackpad is meh. It's glitchy consistently but not constantly. I mostly use an external mouse and when I'm not, it's just internet browsing while on the couch, so it's not a deal breaker for me. Apparently this is a known thing with Asus, they have some great features but their trackpads are kind of subpar. In the long run, easy to put up with for that RAM.<br />Speakers - Laptop speakers aren't great, so don't expect too much here. I have an external sound bar, though, so this isn't an issue for me. Though I have on occasion had some pairing/connectivity issues, so there's that.<br />No backlit keyboard - not terrible but noticeable coming from a laptop that had it. Some have complained about the gray lettering on silver keys, but that hasn't bothered me.<br />Wifi-it's not quite as solid at connectivity as my last laptop but isn't terrible. It's not like it drops out all the time, but it does take a bit longer to connect than I would expect and sometimes it's a tad glitchy. Just a minor annoyance.<br /><br />For a budget laptop, you can do far worse, and overall, it's been suiting my needs very well. About as good a value as I've found at this price point."
AFV5PADG32CII5Z2UQRGJEXIAOJA,B00NW31YSE,2,2,False,"Update: After years of offering certain core features for free, and in fact selling the product with the promise of certain night recording features for free, Canary now has gutted their product and started charging for &#34;free&#34; features. Late one night, an automatic firmware update removed all night recording features of my device that previously were available for free. Now it requires a membership fee to obtain what, hours before, had been free for years. This alone would cost me an additional $120 a year to use the features that had been included with purchase.<br /><br />When you buy a Canary product, you're at the whim of a company that may decide to start charging you for basic features. There's no telling what feature they will remove.<br /><br />I no longer recommend this product at all.<br /><br />-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />After someone was arrested for molesting several children in our area, my wife was very on edge and wanted something to monitor the house for her sake. A monitored system is really expensive when you figure the yearly cost, and I wasn't impressed with the Dropcam, even though I love Nest's thermostat.<br /><br />We picked this up when the price came down considerably. Today it's $177, but I've seen it go as low as $160. Here's my experience:<br /><br />Unboxing and install took at most 10 minutes start to finish. Another 5 minutes to create a Canary account, answer a few configuration questions and set up the WiFi (which is done via Bluetooth). If you don't have bluetooth, there's a cable you can connect to your phone to facilitate the setup.  The device has Ethernet as well as WiFi in both 2.4 and 5ghz bands.<br /><br />After that, it was done. Set it and forget it. I set mine up to have &#34;private&#34; mode on at night, so if I'm strolling through the house naked with a beer in my hand, the videos don't get sent to the Canary servers in the cloud. If you share a house with a roommate, you can both control the device. If one of you is at home, and the other at work, the person at home can set the device to private mode and won't be recorded. I like that feature.<br /><br />For a nanny cam device --<br />It also works. The video lags about 8 seconds when viewed on the phone, but it's fast enough for real-time monitoring. You get audio and video. There's an option to sound a very loud and annoying alarm.<br /><br />As a security device --<br />It needs a bit of tweaking. I got a LOT of false alarms due to cars driving past the windows or the wind shaking a tree out front. I had to turn it down so the ceiling fan wouldn't alert my phone every 5 minutes. I wish there was a bit more intelligent learning algorithm. The motion detection paints a very wide swath, so be prepared for a lot of false alarms.<br /><br />Home temp monitoring and air quality --<br />The air quality feature is cute, and entirely pointless. It has no meaning. If you installed this in your house while burning a few tires, you'd forever have &#34;normal&#34; air quality. It's relative to the air quality on the day you installed it. That's kind of pointless. If your air is toxic initially, what good is a device that calls baseline unhealthy air &#34;normal?&#34; There's no way to determine what pollutant is tripping the sensor, and no numerical value.<br /><br />Temp and humidity are also measured, and they do respond fairly quickly. It's spot on measuring temp and humidity with my Nest thermostat. It's able to alert you if humidity or temp exceed your set preferences.<br /><br />Overall --<br />It's a motion sensor camera with a few silly features like the meaningless air quality sensor. I still like it. I'd buy it again."

This thing is massive power in a massive body. It's honestly probably too powerful since the display is only 1080p and 75hz so you might want to consider just going with the GTX 1060 version.<br /><br />Pros: Runs anything on ultra, stays super cool, great build quality, doesn't look as bad in person. Cons: over 10 pounds with the power supply, you'll need a special bag to carry it, definitely has that gamer look to it.<br /><br />This thing is a performance machine. With a GTX 1070 it can take all you throw at it. However, the 75hz 1080p display will leave you wanting more. Wish it at least came with a 1440p display and 120hz. I think there was an option that did but it didn't have the IPS display and whatever. It's fine. I also like the number of ports. It's got enough USB ports and even a thunderbolt 3 which I didn't find on many competitors.<br /><br />Cooling is fantastic. I read test results and found it ran cooler than MSI and ASUS competitors. My MSI ran so hot I thought I was going to burn myself. The i7-7700 seems to run hot and CAM keeps alerting me that the CPU hit over 80 degrees. Intel says this is normal so I'm not too worried.<br /><br />Construction: The Predator feels solid. In pictures the body looks cheap and the red keys look really tacky but in person it's really well done. The soft touch plastic has a nice feel and the red keys are semi-tacky but I really don't mind. Besides, I'm not bringing this thing to Starbucks to work and at 9.4 pounds you won't want to bring this monster anywhere and if you do, you'll need a special bag because it won't fit in regular 17&#34; bags. I chose the ASUS ROG Shuttle backpack since the Predator bag was twice the price. It also has that gamer look to it so if you want stealth, I'd recommend the Gigabyte 17&#34; version which is a lot cleaner and has the same specs.<br /><br />Other pros, the keyboard is fantastic and the touchpad is really smooth. Hated the touchpad on my MSI and the mouse buttons were hard to press. Downside to construction: the wrist rest has a sharpish edge and can dig into your arm after a while. A rounded or angled front edge would make the laptop more comfortable, especially since it's so thick. That's really the only complaint...<br /><br />Overall: Yeah, I'm pretty psyched about the Predator. It really wasn't on my radar at all while shopping and the horrible pictures really turned me off. After having my heart set on a ROG or MSI, I was stunned to finally go with Acer but so far so good. Really no regrets (other than that I should have bought a tower instead lol)<br /><br />Oh one last thing, the startup sound can EASILY be turned off in like 3 steps. Just google it and everyone in a 2-mile radius will thank you. Acer if you're reading this, get rid of it.<br /><br />Hopefully this helps you choose a new laptop! Enjoy whatever you buy!"

AE55DGZBBJNEMITN67LVSS35VBRA,B005OREE38,5,0,True,"Phanteks did a great job with this large air cooler. It's well made, the fans are very quiet and it can handle most overclocked CPUs with ease. There are some things to consider though: RAM clearance, I had to adjust the first fan up a few MMs to clear my RAM. Not sure if that had an effect on performance. The heat pipes are larger than most air coolers, this significantly improves performance. The fans have a quiet blade design and a high quality bearing. The unit is almost silent. The white model I got came with a white fan header splitter and a small tube of thermal grease that would give you about two applications worth. Installation was a breeze and about the same as most others. Overall, I highly recommend this cooler for those that have a case wide enough to fit it. It's big! Also for those that are overclocking Intel CPU. Anything else like Ryzen 1-3 models this would be total overkill."
AE55DGZBBJNEMITN67LVSS35VBRA,B0725KY3N7,5,1,True,"I’ve built several gaming PCs over the last two years. I’ve gone back and forth between air coolers and AIO coolers. I’ve used every popular AIO manufacturer models in every size too. I installed the Fractal Celsius 360 today in my own gaming rig powered by an overclocked Intel i7 9700K with a 5.0 GHz all core overclock at 1.36V.<br />It’s TDP is about 150 watts under load maybe a bit more. It’s not easy to cool, yet alone cool quietly. I chose the Fractal because many claimed it was quiet, it matches my black and white theme, and I love that it has an auto mode independent of any software or the UEFI.<br />See, using the UEFI to control an AIO fan is just a recipe for loud noise. Using software can be ok but quality and buggy ness of software varies from brand to brand. After a fast and simple install, I set it to Auto mode and have done some benchmarks to see how the temp goes and how the noise level is. It’s near silent so far. My 2070 Super is definitely louder and I don’t hear the pump at all either which is awesome. Some AIO pump have an audible whine to them. Temps have stayed reasonable and low noise too. Having just a single wire to plug onto a header is invaluable as well. Others have as many as three. Very thoughtful design. This one is a keeper."
AE55DGZBBJNEMITN67LVSS35VBRA,B07SW925DQ,3,1,False,"I bought mine from Micro Center. Right away I noticed that the chipset fan is located where it's sucking hot air from my GPU. Not a good place to have that little fan if you actually want to cool the chipset. I was unable to use the EZ-Flash internet feature to update it to the latest Bios and it wouldn't boot into windows until I did the update from a USB drive which was a hassle because it's not straight forward. You got to download the file to the drive, then rename it with a special renaming program (really) and then boot from the USB stick. It was a hassle. From there, the board over volts the 3700x and it's constantly running hot which equals more noise overall. The latest bios with only the turbo boost running had it idling on an AIO 240mm bouncing around between 30-40C. With even a minor task like downloading a game from Steam, the CPU jumped up to 50-60C for that one task. Something isn't right with this board and its bios. You would be hitting some high temps with the stock cooler, which in turn would throttle its boost potential. The other issue is the cost, its very feature limited compared to Gigabyte in regards to VRM, the size and quality of the heat sinks, and no 5v RGB 3 pin headers. There are other things that it lacks for the cost, but those things were what I was looking for considering its supposed to be a board for OC'ing Intel. The audio is also a down grade from what you get with a Strix board, but it's still got that high Strix price. I ended up exchanging it for a different board. Too many issues that need to be addressed."

Going from 110 FPS to 125 FPS wouldn’t be noticeable for the majority of gamers. AMD still is behind Intel in clock speed and this cpu has virtually no overclock headroom so it cannot compete with the Now equally priced core i5-9600k in gaming. Just as the Ryzen 7 3700 cannot compete with the core i7-9700k. Sorry, but don’t believe the hype train. Facts are facts.

The basic requirement was that the external drive had to have sufficient space to accommodate backup images of both PC's and copies of the My Documents directories from both PC's concurrently.  I also wanted an external drive that was capable of supporting either the Windows environment or the Macintosh environment.  I ended up purchasing the Western Digital 500GB My Book Essential Edition USB drive.

Backup of both PC's occurs very rapidly via backup software I purchased separately.  The drive is extremely quiet and the intelligent power up/down mode of operation is great. (The external drive automatically senses when you power down the PC it is connected to and it powers itself down.  It also powers up when the PC is turned on.)<br /><br />Reading other reviews, the only concerns I had before purchase was drives that customers had received that had failed shortly after installation and PC's that had insufficient power to support the external hard drive.

In 1981 I had IBM PC serial number 2 on my desk, my engineers ported the first spreadsheet to the PC as it's first application.  Ever since then I have used PC's, built my own for a few years, then 4 years ago got an high end HP Omen system to use editing my photos that was cheaper than building my own.  My photo editing software (Adobe, Topaz, DxO) wants lots of memory, lots of storage (60,000+ photos), and works best with a fast graphics coprocessor with lots of memory.<br /><br />This unit easily replaced my aging HP system.  The Dell Alienware division has hit a home run with the Aurora series.  You can't build your own PC with this power, cooling case, graphics coprocessor, and features for this price.  It's a beautiful unit, and it's performance is perfect.  I have the high end intel i7 that is water-cooled and never hear the fan speed up when I am hammering it with demanding software.  It is almost silent in use.<br /><br />I have boosted the memory to 64GB, switched out the rotating drive for a Seagate Barracuda Pro 8TB unit.  I have a 14TB Western Digital backup RAID unit so everything is protected.  Note that the communications module is fantastic.  High speed WiFi, Bluetooth, and Ethernet.  I have fiber to my office and it keeps up at the highest rates.<br /><br />For gamers, one feature I want to mention is the box it came in. It doubles as an easy protective carrying case if you wanted to take it to a gaming event. I played with some of the gaming features and it will support just about anything you want to throw at it.  I have dual high res monitors and no problem keeping up with any video demands.<br /><br />The Alienware software is nice, I run it weekly to make sure everything is up to date.  The only thing that didn't work was the transfer software.  I had 4 drives on my Omen, and added a couple of SSD drives to this unit so I could transfer everything.  The Dell software couldn't handle it, had to use PCMover which worked great.  Back in business overnight.<br /><br />Again, this unit is extremely well designed.

This new machine also gives you the option of connecting to the internet via a WiFi card or standard Ethernet connection. I'm using WiFi from now on; I'm pretty sure the electrical surge that killed my old computer came in through the Ethernet connection.<br /><br />The FX6860-UR20P contains a USB 3.0 card with two ports. This machine also sports TEN regular USB 2.0 ports on the back, front and top! You can nestle your MP3 player on the indented platform on top, right next to two USB 2.0 ports and a covered storage compartment.<br /><br />This is an amazingly fast and powerful computer. It processes high definition video or rips through RAW files in Photoshop like they were JPEGs. It easily handles the latest high-end games. The Intel Core i7-2600 Processor and the ATI Radeon HD 6750 Graphics Card are both well regarded. Not bleeding edge, but far more power then almost anyone needs.<br /><br />Drive Bays: I filled the two bay trays with a 1 TB Hatachi hard drive and the 1.5 TB Seagate Barracuda drive rescued from my old Gateway machine. They both work great and gave me tons of additional storage.<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />People seem puzzled, but this tray system is quite simple:<br /><br />1. Turn off the computer. Slide the front panel down. Pull the plastic tray out of the bay with the folding handle.<br />2. Fit a hard drive into the tray, flexing the tray slightly so the pins skewer the screw holes on the sides of the drive.<br />3. Gently slide the tray back in. You'll feel the drive engage the built-in socket at the rear of the bay. No tools necessary; all this takes about 60 seconds.<br />4. Power up the computer.

I also swapped out the generous 8 gigs of RAM in the FX6860-UR20P with the 16 gigs from the old machine. (Yeah, it's overkill, but I already had the RAM sitting there.) Even loaded with these extra goodies, the FX6860-UR20P consumes less power than my old computer--between 86-118 watts as opposed to 140 watts. It also runs cooler and is dead quiet.<br /><br />***YES, THIS COMPUTER SUPPORTS 16 GB OF RAM!*** Despite what some reviewers have said, I popped in 16 GB of RAM and the computer instantly recognized it all with no issues or software tweaks. I've posted a picture of the Windows Experience Index of my present machine.<br /><br />As usual these days, the FX6860-UR20P has no setup disks. The printed instructions are of the pathetic ""don't use this machine in the shower"" sort. You'll want to uninstall the bloatware and make your own disks and backups, of course.<br /><br />Beware: there are NO open card slots available in the FX6860-UR20P. The sizable video card, tiny WiFi card and USB 3.0 card fill all the slots. It also has a curious lack of extra component connectors. I wanted to add a couple of extra case fans and I had to buy some splitters just so I could power them.<br /><br />Be very ware: everyone says that Gateway's customer support is worthless, but I figured it would be worth the risk.

When I opened the box it was easy to set up, and I immediately placed my two camcorder batteries in it to charge.  One was a Sony battery, the other a much larger Energizer battery. They slid into position with no problem.  The fit was a bit loose, so you have to ensure you charge your batteries on a level surface (so contact can be maintained at all times).<br /><br />Once you plug it in and the batteries begin charging, a red LED light above each battery begins blinking.  Now there are four LED lights above each charging section.  When the lights are solid, it means that 25% is charged,  so with the first light on, 25% is charged, second light - 50% charged, third light - 75% charged, and fourth light - 100% charged.<br /><br />When it charged my Sony battery I saw it go from 1 light to three, then when it hit the fourth it blinked while it charged, and then when fully charged it went out!  I'm guessing that was when it was fully charged - and it was - for when I placed it in my Camcorder, the intelligent battery told my camera that it was fully charged.  Oh, it charged this battery rather fast - in about 3 to 4 hours time.

I let it charge overnight and sure enough, in the morning it was still blinking.  I took the battery out and checked it.  It was charged, so I don't know if the unit is defective, or it just cannot handle that large of a battery.

I particularly like the intelligent auto mode which can be engaged by pushing a separate button, rather than by rotating the PASM dial.  You can be in aperture priority mode, decide to shoot automatically, push the button, and when you're done, push it again and return to your aperture priority settings.  Under or over-exposing photos can be done easily with the rocker switch (if you are using a manual zoom) or the rear dial while looking through the EVF.  I set up the display to show a live histogram, something none of my SLRs can do.  Photo quality is excellent:  sharp, clear photos with good color and very low noise at isos 800 or below.  High iso peformance in the 6400 to 12800 range doesn't match my Nikon D7000 but that's to be expected in a camera this size and price.  This camera is a winner!"

AGCOEFY42W6WE3YJVJ6LC4XZSFIQ,B004RC6542,5,0,True,I bought this as a replacement of one of the same model I've had for years that started acting a bit funky.  I also have a Microsoft IntelliMouse Optical 1.1A but the &#34;fwd&#34; button is on the right side and it drives me nuts - I can't seem to keep my right ring finger off of it so I go places I don't want to.  The IntelliMouse Explorer 3.0 Optical tracks well on my desk surface without a mouse pad (which I don't like the feel of) and is very predictable.  It is the best mouse for me.
AEJVBXFMO4MT62UETFSLXDUWRRXA,B00KTL21RA,3,1,True,"I have 3 Asus computers and 3 tablets. I have been loyal for several years because they make excellent, sleek machines. This was the first time I have been disappointed with Asus. I bought my UX303LA-US51T back in July 2015 because it looked like a great deal. My exact configuration is no longer offered but it was Intel i5, QHD, Solid State Drive, Signature Edition, but Intel HD 5500 only, not the Nvidia cards.  I got it on Amazon for $799 which at the time felt like a good deal considering the QHD. I saw the same laptop on Microsoft's Store for $999.<br /><br />My two complaints are the two that have been most often mentioned regarding the UX 303 line.<br />1. The yellow is not yellow – it's mustard. I often work one-on-one with my students and they noticed right away the ugly yellow highlighter that I have on my screen. The good news for those people who have the high-end machines with the Nvidia card is that Nvidia has released a driver to fix the problem. The bad news for those in the cheaper seats is that there has been no fix other than some shady Chinese and Russian backed links from someone who got their computer serviced in China. I was able to fix the yellow on my own adjusting color calibrations but it was at the expense of other colors and brightness. Asus should have fix this. How can you release and Ultrabook in 2015 that doesn't display colors properly?<br /><br />2. The hinge – this is a touchscreen laptop but the hinge on this one has about a full inch of play; it's too loose so that I can't just reach out and touch it I have to grab the back of it with my hand and use my thumb or put one hand behind it to steady it. I have seen pictures of the broken hinges and it's just an awkward design overall. If I pick the laptop up in my hands, the screen bobbles back and forth. Mine is operational but it's just not up to Asus' standards.<br /><br />The UX303 is an &quot;upgrade&quot; from my older ASUS UX31A-BHI5T which is perfect--except it only has 4GB RAM which is not up-gradable and that just isn't enough for Windows 8 and 10. In my opinion the all-black Asus UX31A is 10 times better looking than any of their current ultra books. I still get people thinking it's brand-new when I have it out. I wish they could continue to be inspired by that design.<br /><br />It looks like Asus has fixed these problems for newer/future models. I realize the hinge would require returns but the yellow screen should be fixable. This laptop performs well but I wish I had returned it within the 30 day window; I suppose I was hoping that Asus would hurriedly fix its embarrassingly awful Yellow Color Calibration Catastrophe."
AEJVBXFMO4MT62UETFSLXDUWRRXA,B00FNPD1VW,3,6,False,"Every child at our school gets one of these, which I love; however, I wish Microsoft had gotten on the ball sooner with the lower priced laptops for education. I also received the HP 14 Chromebook so between fixing students' laptops and mine, I am pretty familiar with them. If you only ever use a laptop to browse the internet, or you don't collaborate with others using Microsoft office products, and mostly do 1 or 2 things simultaneously, they are fine. They start up fast, weigh nothing, and since my students and I use Google Drive, the sharing of folders is seamless, but it would be the same on a fully stocked Windows or Mac computer.  I find I am sometimes making apologies for Chromebooks' ability level when speaking with students or parents. &#34;You want to write/edit a PDF? You can't use Foxfi like in Windows, but there are some really awful apps in the Chromestore.&#34; &#34;You want to print? Yes you can, but only if your home printer is Cloud-ready or there is a dedicated printer attached to a Classic Printer.&#34; I love Google Cloud Print, but some of my students and parents have a tough time setting it up.<br /><br />As long as you are aware that you can't download software to this machine, like Skype, Word, Excel, Foxit, etc, you will like it. You can use Office through OneDrive, which is Microsoft's answer to Google Drive. If you can find Cloud/online/app versions of your favorite software, even better. Now that Microsoft has lowered the cost of it's licensing fees, and Intel is making a cheaper chip, there are some price competitive Windows laptops coming out. It will be interesting to see how/if Google reacts when price isn't a huge deciding factor for Chromebooks anymore. Google is coming out with some wonderful apps for education, and they maybe they will make those more integrated into the Chromebook experience."
AE4P2JU3TZNH5PZZUHKF6J6CIM4A,B07C6KN262,5,7,False,"I’m a desktop computer guy. I’ve had a few laptops in the past and have been pretty underwhelmed by them. In general, in my experience, dollar for dollar desktops outperform laptops.<br /><br />I have to say that this HP Envy is a very welcome exception to that rule. The CPU is an Intel Core i7, as good as anything in a desktop. With 12 gigs of RAM it blazes through apps, and has a terabyte of storage. On top of all that, it has an optical drive, a major plus and something that’s becoming ever more rare in laptops. That means that in addition to being able to write to an external medium (for archiving or whatever) you can watch videos, as well as game.<br /><br />Speaking of gaming, it has a pretty impressive graphics card, too. Not enough for a full-blown gaming experience for those games with very high graphics needs, but still pretty impressive.<br /><br />The touch screen is a very large 17 inches. Of course, this makes the entire unit somewhat bigger than what’s becoming the “standard” small size for laptops, but again, it’s a tradeoff. Great visuals versus small size.<br /><br />Set up was very easy, and it was up and running in no time. To this point I haven’t experienced any of the problems mentioned in the other two reviews that are up at this time, nor any others.<br /><br />Loaded with features, very fast and capable, I’m beyond impressed with this laptop. A very solid 5 stars."
AE4P2JU3TZNH5PZZUHKF6J6CIM4A,B00K4PALMI,4,5,False,"This laptop from Dell shows their usual commitment to quality. Fit and finish are excellent, and it's very attractive.<br /><br />Very slim and lightweight; excellent display resolution; sensitive keys; bright and wide display. Very fast startup, at least with the minimal programs included with the unit. The first time I used it to log onto Dell's website it downloaded a free facial recognition program which allows the user to log on by the onboard camera scanning the face instead of typing in a password. It works well enough.<br /><br />Touch screen response in addition to touchpad and keyboard. Windows 8.1 OS. Intel Core i7 processor (the latest and greatest); 8 gigs of RAM (more than the minimum required to operate this unit, so it makes it QUICK when coupled with the i7 CPU). Responsive touchpad right where you'd expect it. A full terabyte of storage.<br /><br />Really, really nice.<br /><br />Now for the ""BUT..."":<br /><br />NO OPTICAL DRIVE???? Really?<br /><br />I deducted one whole star just for that alone. You can't play or record or use any kind of disc. Not DVD, not CD, not Blu-Ray.<br /><br />I do a LOT of photography, both stills and video, which I then edit and turn into home movies (with menus) on DVD, and still photo DVD or CD ""albums"" which others can then watch on their own TVs. Well, no can do on this computer because it doesn't have an optical drive. No way to create or share those productions with anyone.<br /><br />Yeah, yeah, yeah... I know the latest ""great thing"" is that we're all supposed to store everything on ""the cloud"". Well, first of all, I have zero interest in storing all my personal stuff on some ""cloud"" somewhere where I don't know WHO can get access to it. I want it right here where I can control it. For backup, I use two separate and portable external hard drives.<br /><br />There's also no way, as far as I've been able to find, to create ""rescue discs"", again because there's NO OPTICAL DRIVE. Computer crash? You're screwed, plain and simple.<br /><br />Now, I'm sure an external optical drive can be connected via USB... but then you've turned your ""portable"" laptop into a desktop. Kinda negates the whole idea of the thing, right?<br /><br />Next problem:  the touch screen. This is my first computer with that feature, something more commonly associated with cell phones and tablets. IMO, they're appropriate on those things, but relatively useless on a laptop. It seems to be a bit laggy, and certainly not as precise as using the unit's touchpad-operated cursor. Plus I'm already seeing finger smears on my screen. How attractive, I'm sure...<br /><br />Dell claims in the promo blurb that this unit is good for gaming. Well, I think that depends on what you consider ""gaming"". It will certainly play some games, but I'm highly doubtful if that would include immersive and complex RPGs (for example).<br /><br />You can buy and install (online only as there's NO OPTICAL DRIVE) a bunch of games that look to me to be the kind of games that you'd run on Xbox or something like it. But the big games like Skyrim or Dragon Age require some tech specs that I'm not really seeing here. The hard drive runs at 5400 RPM, and I think anything less than 7200 is going to be problematic for the more immersive games.<br /><br />Also, it's got an ""intergrated"" video card - whatever that means - and I haven't been able to find any actual performance specs on it. So I'd take the ""gaming"" claim with a lot of salt.<br /><br />The other major problem here is the OS. It's Windows 8.1. Now, I can't ding Dell on this one. That's the latest OS Microsoft's got out there, and manufacturers like Dell have to go with what's available.<br /><br />But, boy oh boy, everything sucky I've heard about this OS is true. It's one of the main reasons I've put off considering getting a new computer to this point. I currently depend on my Dell XPS 8000 running Windows 7 (a truly fabulous desktop), and if I had to depend on something using Windows 8.1, I'd probably end up going back to an abacus. It's laggy, and I completely HATE the default ""desktop"". You can switch to a more ""traditional"" desktop appearance, but it doesn't stay there - or at least I can't find a way to make it do so permanently - and every time I inadvertently touch the wrong spot on the screen I end up with those cell-phone-like tiles all over my screen. Why do the drones at Microsoft think we want our computers to be nothing more than big iPads?<br /><br />Anyway, there you have it; 3 ½ stars rounded up."
AE4P2JU3TZNH5PZZUHKF6J6CIM4A,B003X26LXW,5,19,False,"To give you some background, I'm a former Military Intelligence Agent, and hold a current PI license in California. One of my areas of specialization is security.<br /><br />Through Amazon's Vine program, Logitech graciously provided to me a system that included two cameras: one for exterior application, and one for the interior.<br /><br />Software installation on my home computer (Intel i7 Dell Studio XPS 8000, Win 7) was flawless and incredibly effortless. The camera signal receiver is then installed by simply plugging it into a house outlet and your computer system or system's router. Once installed, the software checked for updates, then searched for and found the cameras.<br /><br />The camera installation was also incredibly easy. Connect the physical camera by wire to its transmitting box, which then plugs into your house electrical wiring through any standard outlet. Every single bit of necessary hardware is in the boxes, including everything needed for the physical mounting of the cameras to walls or ceilings.<br /><br />The quality and coverage of the image was simply outstanding (including sound). I tested the exterior camera by placing it in my garage with the doors closed and the lights off, and even in near total darkness there was still a very good and usable image on my computer monitor.<br /><br />Each camera can record up to a week on the internal 2GB Mini-SD memory card, and cards of larger capacity can be used to extend that time. If recording is being stored on the memory card -  if your computer's not on, for example - it then backs up to your computer when your computer comes back online.<br /><br />There are some considerations to keep in mind when deciding on camera placement. The weakest link in any security camera system is the power/comms connection from the camera to the base. If this is disabled, you have a basically useless box hanging there. So you want to make sure that any approach to your camera's external wiring is in the field of view of the camera.<br /><br />Anything recorded only on the camera's internal memory card is useless if the camera is torn off and stolen. You want to keep the computer on and functional for monitoring/recording purposes.<br /><br />Nothing is foolproof. If someone steals the cameras and the computer, you essentially are left with nothing. It makes sense to have a reliable offsite backup in effect that's regularly backing the video up, something like Carbonite, perhaps.<br /><br />Obviously, if the power goes out at your house, the system goes inoperative. Not much you can do about that, unless you have an auxiliary power system in place, rare in residential environments.<br /><br />I think this system is exceptionally capable for a residential application; extremely well-made, durable, and of very high quality.<br /><br />Five stars."

AFE54MELB5IGFUYBSOBGJOSOMEPA,B08BRJHHQS,4,1,False,"There seem to be a flood of these tiny Windows 10 PCs hitting the market at the moment. Most of them have very similar specs and features. They all are little larger than a pack of cigarettes, they generally have both wireless and Ethernet connectivity,  they usually feature less USB ports than what you will actually need, offer between 4-8GB of RAM and between 16-64GB of non-upgradable ROM and feature a very low-end Intel Celeron processor. Of the many I have seen and tested, this is one of the more expensive models, with most clocking in at around $150.<br /><br />There really is not much that distinguishes this product from some of it's cheaper counterparts other than the fact that it has a more durable metal case. Most of these products only have plastic cases. This model also happens to support a Display Port output as opposed to just HDMI. I'm not really sure what the advantage to that would be unless you just happen to own a monitor that only offers a Display Port option though. The product comes with an external mounting bracket and an external antenna port in the event that you need to connect an outdoor wi-fi antenna.<br /><br />Windows 10 comes pre-installed, but you will need to go through the setup process which requires you to either have a Microsoft account or to set up a new one. There is no option to continue the installation without internet connectivity. Once the basic setup is completed you will need to install the usual Microsoft product updates. The installation does not come with any extra, unwanted software as you will find on many new PCs, so you won't have to spend hours uninstalling a bunch of useless or even malicious software. It's a pretty clean build.<br /><br />Like most similar products this one suffers from the same, basic restrictions. The Intel Celeron CPU is woefully underpowered for performing all but the most simple tasks and is absolutely horrible at multitasking. With 4GB of RAM you will run out of memory fairly quickly unless you stick to a single task. Although it supposedly supports 4K video it has an on-board graphics chipset that just barely keeps up with 1080 streaming. You can forget doing any kind of gaming or running any application that uses lots of graphics. It only supports HDMI rev 1.4, which also limits your external display options.<br /><br />MINIX seems to be targeting the electronic signage and internet appliance market but other than the option to support a Display Port it really does not bring anything all that special to the table that you can't get from a similar device costing much less. While it does come with a more heavy duty case , it isn't like these devices are going to see a lot of physical wear and tear. If the unit had a more heavy-duty power supply I could see that being considered something that would make it more ""industrial"" but it comes with a simple, inexpensive wall transformer like every other mirco PC uses. If you are looking for a single use PC that doesn't need to do much in the way of graphics and doesn't consume a lot of memory this product will definitely do the job. However, I can't find any reason to recommend it over similar models that cost a lot less though."
AFE54MELB5IGFUYBSOBGJOSOMEPA,B01HUOE12G,5,0,False,"If there's one thing that I do not need at this point in my life it is unnecessarily complicated products that solve problems that I don't have. This seems to often be the problem I have buying switches these days. Manufacturers tend to think that if they label something as &#34;smart&#34; or &#34;intelligent&#34; that they can sell it for a premium and still cut corners on the basic functions of the device. This happens to be one instance where you get exactly what you pay for and nothing you do not need.<br /><br />Netgear keeps it simple with this switch. It's unmanaged. There is no web interface. No configuration. No routing functions. No added network traffic. No complications. The only added feature it has is PoE for powering Ethernet connected devices. I happen to have two webcams and a VoIP system that requires PoE, so this was an added feature that I actually needed. So, this switch does everything that I NEED it to do.<br /><br />Installation of this product is a no-brainer. There is a small set-up manual for it, but I have never read it, nor do I intend to. This is an unmanaged switch. I expect to just be able to plug my Ethernet connections into it and walk-away for at least a few years before I even have to think about replacing it with something new. Mission accomplished. Installation for me included attaching the included 19&#34; rackmount tabs and attaching them to my rack enclosure. All of the parts that I needed to rack mount the device were included. They also included some rubber feet for desktop mounting and some wood screws for wall mounting.<br /><br />The best thing that I could possibly say about this product is that I plugged it in and noticed nothing different than with my previous switch. This happens to be an upgrade from an existing 8 port Gigabit switch. Other than the fact that this unit has more ports and PoE built-in (which means I have one less piece of equipment that can go wrong) there is nothing different about this switch than my previous installation. It consolidates my equipment, saves space and works right out of the box. I was able to swap out the old switch for this one in less than 5 minutes and have noticed nothing different in the way my network works. All of my PoE devices seem to work fine as well.<br /><br />Sometimes, &#34;dumb&#34; is just better than &#34;smart&#34;. This product is a fine example. I've used tons of Netgear equipment over the years and do not expect to have any problems with this device during my lifetime. I have had some Netgear equipment for close to 20 years. None of it has stopped working. Some of the older stuff has just become &#34;functionally obsolete&#34; though. With this product I hope to replace it only after it becomes obsolete, not because it quit working. I think that the odds are pretty good that this will end up being the case."
AFE54MELB5IGFUYBSOBGJOSOMEPA,B06XFDVB2N,4,5,False,"The Dell XPS8920-7673BLK-PUS Tower Desktop is a powerful machine that goes well beyond the specs that most home users will ever need, but falls slightly short of being a great gaming computer out of the box.<br /><br />The machine's quad core i7 Intel CPU is a blazing fast processor. It's 8GB of DDR4 memory is incredibly fast as well, although gamers will definitely want to upgrade this unit with more memory than the 8GB that comes pre-installed. Fortunately, this model will accept up to 64GB of DDR4 RAM, which is pretty incredible. I have not researched the overclocking capabilities of this particular CPU, but at 3.6GHz per core (x4 cores) it is already plenty fast without resorting to any firmware tweaking.<br /><br />The model's biggest letdown is with the 1TB mechanical hard drive. This provides plenty of storage, but why would anyone use a mechanical hard drive when you can get a much faster solid state drive at fairly cheap prices these days? The drive is definitely the biggest bottleneck in this system when it comes to speed and should be replaced with an SSD. It is easy enough to replace and there is plenty of room on the inside of the case for additional drives, but it really should come with a Solid State Drive standard.<br /><br />The second biggest letdown with this model was all of the bloatware that came pre-installed. Plan on spending an hour or so uninstalling a bunch of useless trial software, junk from Microsoft you will never use, Dell utilities that are more trouble than they are worth and that wretched McAfee Antivirus. Getting rid of McAfee and replacing it with ANY other antivirus product should speed up your system significantly.<br /><br />Once you have uninstalled the software you don't need, it is time to change your preferences, security and privacy settings to turn off as much of Microsoft's spyware features as possible. This is a process that all Windows 10 users will have to deal with, unfortunately. There are also plenty of unnecessary Microsoft services that you can shut off if you are not using them (i.e. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) that will help to free up memory, speed up the system and consume less power. FYI, the computer I received had Windows 10 Pro pre-installed. I know that another reviewer stated that they only received the Home version, but mine has the 64 bit version of Windows 10 Pro.<br /><br />Once you have the software and settings fine-tuned the system is lightening fast. It comes with the newest USB 3.1 interface for outrageously fast file transfers to external drives. It also supports wi-fi and the latest version of Bluetooth for peripherals.<br /><br />The system's NVIDIA GeForce GT 730 video card is enough to handle all but the most intensive graphics needs. If you are a gamer who needs the level of processing that a second video card requires, there is plenty of room to add a second card. The 460W power supply should be adequate for handling an additional video card as well. There is no skimping for space when it comes to the motherboard, adding additional cards or expansion room inside the case. The case itself is very solid and well constructed compared to the vast majority of desktops I see these days, without being oversized or outrageously heavy. It is also quite attractive and blends into most environments.<br /><br />The fans are almost noiseless on this unit. It makes less noise than most laptop computers do, with the exception of the 7,200 RPM mechanical hard drive. The drive will not typically make much noise unless you are scanning or moving a large number of files at once though.<br /><br />There are no instructions included to speak of. If you have used Windows 10 before, no real explanation of how to use the operating system is necessary. You will have to check Dell's website if you need to download detailed specs or a user manual though.<br /><br />To sum it up, this desktop is probably more than the average person needs for a home computer, but it never hurts to have the extra speed. It also makes a great starting point for building a high-performance gaming computer. I am dinging Dell one star for not providing a Solid State Drive standard. With that slight caveat, I would definitely recommend this model if you need an extremely fast and easily upgradable home, business or multimedia computer."
AFE54MELB5IGFUYBSOBGJOSOMEPA,B01IEVLTDI,5,4,False,"I have used a few different NAS products in the past for my home and business networks, but this Netgear Ready NAS really puts them all to shame. Granted, the cost of this Ready NAS 12 bay model was quite a bit higher than I had paid for any of those other models, but this is really a mile ahead when it comes to storage capacity, performance and reliability.<br /><br />Front and center with this model is the web-based software interface. It reminds me of some of the better UPS software interfaces I have used in the past, with fine tuning and detailed diagnostics available on just about every aspect of the device's operations. The NAS' complexity can largely be safely ignored during normal operations, but if you need to do any advanced troubleshooting or diagnostics the web interface should provide you with everything you need.<br /><br />Initial setup of the device is simple, but not exactly speedy, unless you happen to be starting off with a bunch of unformatted drives of the same, exact capacity. I had six drives to use with this device, which only used up half of the system's total capacity. I initially started the system with just two drives. The software automatically configured the system into a RAID 1 array, which is the only form of RAID available with two drives. As soon as I added the third drive it auto-configured itself into a RAID 5 array. I kept adding drives until I got all six running. In all, it took a bit over 7 hours for all of the drives to sync themselves. I only spent about 5 minutes setting everything up. The rest of the time was spent waiting for the drives to finish syncing. Having configured RAID arrays on both Windows and LINUX servers in the past, I can tell you that it always seems to take forever for drives to finish syncing, but it's perfectly normal.<br /><br />What really impressed me with the initial setup was that I basically just installed a bunch of random mechanical hard drives that I had laying around of various makes, models, capacities and rotation speeds. One of them even had a few known bad sectors on it, but they were all recognized, formatted and synced with no problem whatsoever. I did get a warning about the bad sectors on the one drive, but the system simply worked around them for the time being. Nice.<br /><br />Despite having dual, redundant power supplies and the ability to support up to 12x 7,200 RPM mechanical drives, the system only used around 75 WATTS of electricity with six drive bays occupied. That is amazingly efficient compared to past models I have used. Each PSU has its own power cord and can be pulled out in a hot-swap fashion. The drives can also be easily hot-swapped during normal operations with no downtime. In addition to the 12 drive bays in front, there are also two 2 eSATA ports in the back and 2 USB 3.0 ports. I do not believe that external drives can be added as part of the system's combined RAID array, but they CAN be configured for independent network file sharing. I am not certain what, if any, limits exist on the number of external USB 3.0 drives that can be added and shared. In theory, you could possibly add dozens of additional drives in this fashion using a simple (external powered) USB hub though.<br /><br />On top of the internal and external storage capabilities, the system also supports iSCSI and various cloud drive services including Amazon S3, Google Drive, Dropbox, Amazon Cloud Drive, ReadyNAS Backup and ReadyCLOUD.<br /><br />One of my favorite features of this device is the number of networking options available via the 4 included Gigabit Ethernet ports. Each port can be individually configured with it's own IP address and/or utilized in a bonded fashion with round-robin, load balancing, failover, bandwidth aggregation, etc. You can also assign ports to different networks and create custom VLANs. Both IPV4 and IPV6 can be mixed and matched on each interface as you wish.<br /><br />The system has a real-time antivrus scanner application included, but from what I can tell this is simply a free implementation of CLAMAV that comes with no documentation or support from Netgear. All that you can do from the web-based interface is turn it on or off and run updates. Turning it on WILL slow down the system. CLAMAV is open source with no heuristic scanning or intelligence to combat zero day exploits, so it should not be relied upon for anything but the most basic protection from known viruses.<br /><br />By far, the most surprising feature that I ran across with this device is the ability to deploy full-blown server applications via something that resembles an app store. Dozens of pre-screened apps are available for download via the web interface and can be easily deployed in a matter of minutes. Most of them are open source. Some fall under different licenses, but they include everything from the latest version of PHP to a full-blown Asterisk VoIP server. Some of the more recognizable apps available are MySQL, SugarCRM, Drupal, DVBlink, Joomla, Logitech Media Server, osCommerce, Twonky and apps to add Bittorrent, surveillance, DNS and a VPN server capabilities. The system already comes with the ability to share files via services such as SMB, SSH, FTP, Rsync, NFS, HTTPS, UPnP, ReadyDLNA, iTunes and more, so these additional apps are just icing on the cake. All of the apps are free, without licensing costs, that I have tested so far.<br /><br />Also worthy of mention here is the product's excellent build quality. Obviously, this product was designed with business and industrial use in mind. It fits nicely into a standard 19&#34; rack and comes with rails, mounting hardware, Ethernet cables and everything you need to get up-and-running with just a screwdriver. There is a one page setup guide, but the rest of the documentation is online.<br /><br />Compared to setting up a Windows or LINUX based NAS server, this product is truly a walk in the park. It's flexibility as a platform is an unexpected bonus on top of its rock solid reliability and construction. It's basically a slam-dunk for any admin that needs to set up a little or a whole lot of network storage with no learning curve and no unexpected feature or hardware restrictions."
AFE54MELB5IGFUYBSOBGJOSOMEPA,B01KLSMWVA,3,253,False,"I had a difficult/impossible time obtaining full specs on this computer when I first ordered it. In fact, I could not find any info at all on the Lenovo website about this particular model. Therefore, I am going to post the full specs here at the end of my review. I will give the basic rundown before we get to that though.<br /><br />To put it nicely, this is a very entry level computer that seems to be designed around keeping manufacture as inexpensive as possible and low power consumption. There is little to no room for expansion in the way of memory, video, extra drives, expansion slots, etc. In other words, you are never going to be able to upgrade this computer to something better or faster through spending money on upgrades, other than perhaps ditching the mechanical hard drive for a solid-state drive.<br /><br />MOTHERBOARD/CASE features a total 3 SATA ports, two of which are already in use by the main hard drive and the DVD R-W drive. There are NO available drive bays inside the case, so using the 3rd SATA port is not going to happen. There is simply no room for an additional drive.<br /><br />POWER SUPPLY is super small and the case leaves almost no room for upgrading to a more powerful or efficient PSU. It seems to be rated at 180 WATTS Max. Fotunately, the entire computer only seems to use an average of 25 WATTS or so. This is a huge reduction in electricity consumption compared to compters made just a few years ago. Basically, the equivelant of a 25 WATT lightbulb.<br /><br />GRAPHICS are strictly on-board, using an Intel HD Graphics 530 chipset. There is a PCIE slot available for adding an additional video card, but I have doubts as to whether the existing power supply could handle powering a high-level video card.<br /><br />CONNECTIVITY Comes with onboard Gigabit Ethernet along with onboard wi-fi adapter. There is a tiny antenna on the outside of the case for wi-fi, which makes for a rather limited reception capability. Bluetooth is also onboard.<br /><br />MEMORY/STORAGE The main board has two available slots for DDR4 memory, both of which are in use. So, no room for additional RAM. Storage consists of a Seagate mechanical hard drive running at 7200 RPM with 1TB of storage space. Why they are still using mechanical hard drives as a primary drive, I have no idea. Even at 7200 RPM, there is a lot of lag on this drive, which brings Windows 10 to an absolute crawl at times. If you are going to upgrade anything on this computer, the hard drive would be my #1 choice. Old-fashioned HDDs are great for mass storage, but suck as primary drives compared to SSDs.<br /><br />SOFTARE Not much special here. An OEM version of Windows 10 Home. Much has been written about Windows 10, so I'm not going to try re-inventing the wheel in this review. Suffice to say, if you are at all concerned about privacy and security you will need to spend some time changing the default settings. As-is, Windows 10 sacrifices a lot of your privacy.<br /><br />CONCLUSION This Lenovo desktop has a very small footprint and consumes a tiny amount of electricity. Probably less than most laptop computers (minus the monitor). It would make a good entry-level computer for the home user who browses the web, writes letters or plays solitaire. It is not a gaming computer, nor can it be upgraded to one. It has more storage space than the casual user will ever need, but storage space is gained at the expense of drive speed. It is a good computer for a beginner or the elderly. It's capabilities will not expand much beyond that though.<br /><br />POWER SUPPLY: HuntKey HK-280 22FP, 180W, Rated 80+<br />MOTHERBOARD: Lenovo IH110MS<br />MEMORY: 2x 4GB DDR4 SDRAM<br />AVERAGE POWER CONSUMPTION: 25W<br />HARD DISK DRIVE: Seagate ST1000DM003, 1TB, 64MB Cache, 7,200 RPM, SATA 6.0Gb/s, 3.5&#34;<br />OPTICAL DRIVE: PLDS Model DH16AFSH, DVD R-W<br />CPU: Intel Core i3-6100 dual core @3.7GHz<br />ONBOARD GRAPHICS: Intel HD Graphics 530<br />ONBOARD NIC: Realtek PCIE GBE Family Gigabit Ethernet<br />OS: Windows 10 Home.

AFE54MELB5IGFUYBSOBGJOSOMEPA,B00IXNQ6XQ,4,4,False,"The Linksys 8 port Business Smart Gigabit Switch is a managed switch aimed at a fairly narrow market. That would seem to be very small or home businesses that do not have a configurable router and that are using applications in need of traffic prioritization. This would include those using VoIP devices or telephony applications, gamers, people using web conferencing software/hardware or anything that requires real-time communications. In most cases you would be better off buying a router that handles these types of quality of service issues, but for those who do not have that option, this product is a good alternative.<br /><br />First of all, although this switch will definitely work as a plug-and-play (dumb) device, using it as such would not only be a waste of money but could possibly open up a security hole in your network that didn't exist prior to plugging it in. So, if you are not going to take the time to configure it, don't buy it. You are better off with a cheap un-intelligent switch if you do not intend to configure it.<br /><br />For those of you who actually intend to program your switch, set-up and operation are fairly straight-forward as long as you have an advanced knowledge of networking principles.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed when testing this model is that unlike most non-managed switches there is about a minute or so of boot time that it takes between plugging the switch in and before it actually starts passing traffic. That time delay is definitely shorter if you program the switch to use a static IP address rather than relying on it to grab a DHCP address from your router though. The web-based interface will first need to be accessed at whatever random IP address that your switch happens to grab which you will need to determine via a scan of your network or by accessing your router to look for a new connection. There is NO software that comes with the switch, so you will just need to figure it out on your own. When I installed the switch it showed-up using a device name of &#34;GoAhead-Webs&#34;. I have no clue as to what this references, but it does not identify itself using the manufacturer name as most devices do.<br /><br />Once you get into the web interface (which is quite snappy in comparison to most managed switches I have used) you have a fairly extensive list of options available to you. The interface uses plain (networking) language for its configuration terms, so those of you who don't &#34;speak&#34; Cisco should be pretty comfortable. There is no printed manual that comes with the product, but the included CD includes documentation that is pretty well written. There are a few telephony-specific configuration options available that I had not seen in previous versions of LinkSys managed switches, which is a nice touch for those of you using it for VoIP QoS purposes.<br /><br />I was a little bit disappointed in regards to the switch's approach towards updating its firmware. There is a drop-down menu to install updated firmware that you have stored on a local device, but there is no way to check to see what the latest firmware version is other than going to the LinkSys support website and searching through the documentation. This seems pretty dumb for an &#34;intelligent&#34; switch, but that's life.<br /><br />In actual operation the unit definitely works as advertised. I think that my managed router probably makes any possible network optimizations that this switch performs a bit of overkill, but if you are using a decent managed router you probably would not need this product in the first place. The product is crazy cheap for a managed switch with so many features, but of course it is limited to a maximum of 8 ports. If you are never going to expand beyond that capacity, the Linksys 8-Port Business Smart Gigabit switch is a great product and a great deal."
AFE54MELB5IGFUYBSOBGJOSOMEPA,B0106AOB7G,3,8,False,"I have to rate this drive squarely in the middle as compared to the rest of its SSD counterparts. I ran benchmark tests on the drive alongside another solid state drive that I had bought earlier this year, made by Kingston. The results were fairly comparable, in that both fell well short of their advertised maximum read/write speeds.<br /><br />Disk read speeds on the OCZ Trion 100 Series (240GB) SSD were fairly average, clocking in at just a little better than 300 MB/s at its absolute fastest. That's nowhere near the advertised max speed of 550 MB/s, but at least it's in the ballpark. On disk writing speeds, benchmark tests showed the OCZ disk to not even be in the same zip code, let alone the ballpark, though. At best, I was able to eek out 100 MB/s, as compared to the advertised max write of 520 MB/s. I ran the same test 5 times in a row to assure accuracy. Disappointing? Yes. Surprising? No.<br /><br />Unfortunately, solid state drives not living up to their specs seems to be the norm with most manufacturers today, including OCZ. The common excuse seems to be that I just happened to get a bad one, or that I must not be testing the drive correctly. I have been building computers for myself and for my customers for 20+ years now. In other words, I know what I'm doing and how to properly test computer equipment. The benchmarks simply don't lie. Unfortunately, 90% of the drives I test these days are no better, which is why I am cutting OCZ some slack. It is not THE cheapest drive on the market (the similar Kingston 240GB drive is selling for about $10 cheaper at the moment), but it is still way cheaper than a drive that I would expect to pass benchmarks with flying colors.<br /><br />Bottom line, as long as you aren't actually expecting this drive to operate anywhere near it's advertised speeds, it is a pretty good deal. If you want/need a drive that actually performs to spec and is screaming fast, I would suggest something from the Intel 5XX series of solid state drives.You will pay nearly twice as much for Intel's drives, but you can always rely upon them to run at the speeds they advertise. In the end, you get what you pay for in the world of SSDs."
AFE54MELB5IGFUYBSOBGJOSOMEPA,B00A1ZTZNM,3,10,True,"I recently purchased a Kingston SSDNOW V300 drive (capacity 240GB) to replace an older OCZ SSD with 128GB of capacity. Obviously, I was not expecting a huge improvement in performance, but I did expect the drive to reasonably live up to its stated specs.<br /><br />Insofar as everyday use is concerned, I could not tell any difference in speed between the two SSDs. To start off with a ""clean slate"", I reinstalled Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit edition from scratch. There was no problem recognizing the drive and no special drivers were needed. The drive is being used on a 6GBps SATA port on my motherboard and the mobo BIOS is correctly set up to run the drive in AHCI mode. The machine itself is a quad core AMD rig that I built myself. It has plenty of RAM, CPU overhead, free space on the main drive, is set with the TRIM command for Windows 7, etc. I ran Kingston's utility program in Windows to verify that the latest BIOS for the drive was loaded.<br /><br />Having given Kingston as close to a level playing field as possible outside of a clean room, I set out to benchmark the drive using the manufacturer's recommended benchmarking program ATTO. I have posted the results from a screenshot that should appear somewhere on this page.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the results were decent in the READ mode, but definitely NOT up to the manufacturer's claimed specs. The benchmark shows read speeds that peaked at about 325MB/S. Not bad, but definitely well short the manufacturer's claimed specs of ""up to"" 450MB/S. On the other hand, the WRITE speeds clocked were astonishingly bad. At best, it hit a little over 100MB/S, but most of the time fell well short of that. Keep in mind, this is the vendor's preferred benchmark test on a system that is, if anything, overbuilt. This was a fresh purchase from Amazon and the drive arrived in perfect condition. Obviously, there is no excuse for falling so far short of the product's ""guaranteed"" specs.<br /><br />Like many others here, I have speculated as to why the drive seems to perform so well for some and so lousy for others. I'm pretty sure that I have discovered why. Going through the documentation on Kingston's own website is the following statement:<br /><br />""The V300 is our entry-level SSD targeting the mainstream user. In order to achieve a balance of price and performance, Kingston will source NAND Flash components from various Tier 1 NAND manufacturers. Our V300 SSDs are built with either synchronous or asynchronous NAND Flash components. Kingston specs the V300 SSD using ATTO 2.41 to achieve a minimum of 450MB/s Read / Write. Your results may differ should you benchmark your drive with something other than ATTO 2.41.""<br /><br />The first thing worth pointing out here is that rather than a ""maximum"" READ/WRITE speed of 450MB/S (as is claimed in the original specs), Kingston claims in this passage that it tests the memory it buys to perform at a MINIMUM of 450MB/S. That's quite a difference. Unfortunately, the drive I received did not approach anywhere near those speeds using their own designated benchmarking tool.<br /><br />The most telling part of Kingston's statement though is that they are basically buying memory on the open market from various different vendors. Generally speaking, when companies outsource this way, the manufacturer with the lowest bid is usually the one who gets the contract. Add to that the fact that Kingston uses ""either synchronous or asynchronous"" NAND memory (one is expensive and fast, the other is cheap and slow) and it becomes obvious as to why people are reporting such wildly differing results in speed here. Obviously, some of the NAND memory that Kingston gets on the open market performs quite well, while at other times they may get a shipment that falls well short of expectations. All of it seems to make it past ""quality control"" though and users are basically taking a crapshoot as to what kinds of speed they are going to get, regardless of the fact that the product looks exactly the same on the outside and comes with the same firmware version.<br /><br />FYI, I do not believe that the firmware version has ANY bearing on how well the drive performs. I believe that the lack of consistency in their product is due solely to the varying levels of quality in NAND memory that they buy.<br /><br />With all that being said, I am not going to take a total dump on this drive and relegate my review to one star. The truth is, the V300 is (more times than not) THE cheapest SSD you can find, regardless of where you buy it from. The saying, ""You get what you pay for"" definitely applies here. There's a reason why this drive is so cheap as compared to one of the same capacity made by Intel or OCZ. Between that and the numerous reviews that you can find of this product across the internet, buyers should know that they are taking a gamble on buying this particular model. You may get speeds at the manufacturer's claimed specs. Then again, you may get a relative dud like I did. It still runs faster than any 7200RPM hard drive that you can find though. Honestly, I think that I probably got my money's worth. For those of you who aren't that savvy when it comes to buying computer components though, keep the above info in mind. If you are looking for a CHEAP SSD, this one is a pretty good deal (assuming that it isn't DOA). If you are looking for something FAST, reliable and that actually performs to spec, keep shopping."

The mounting kit fit like a glove with SSD drives from Intel, Samsung and Kingston. The construction is solid, the mounting holes placed perfectly and the screws are exactly the proper length. This is one of those products that either works 100%, or doesn't work at all, so I'm giving it five stars. Especially considering its price and free shipping as an add-on item with Amazon Prime, buying these would seem to be a no-brainer. I just wish these had come on to the market a few years earlier."

When I first built a desktop computer for myself in 1999 I made sure that it had the, at the time, brand new Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer. This was one of the first optical mice and I had that mouse for ten years before the cable started to fail. I've since purchased a Microsoft Explorer mouse, which is basically a stripped down, cheaper version of the original model and it's great and only cost me about $15. Microsoft now has introduced their bluetrack technology and I have to say, it does deliver. This mouse tracks better than previous mice, you'll notice this if you're using weird surfaces, if you're not you'll still have the same great mouse that you had before.  The end result is that the price of the mouse has gone up but the performance for people who aren't regularly mousing over carpet, their pants, or other weird surfaces, won't see much of an improvement.

AF4EUWOFIR62Z6IC6DDS34RP6UCQ,B00CPLGFM4,3,3,True,"AMD lags behind intel in single threaded performance, so if you're going to go AMD, its best to at least have a bunch of cores. I'd recommend either getting an older A8 or an intel i3 if you need something cheap. Running Windows 8 with just firefox open, I'm hitting 100% on both cores very frequently. This causes some lag and its kinda annoying. Its not the worst thing in the world, but I don't think the amount of money you'd save getting this processor is worth it. I still gave it 3 stars because its at least what it claims to be. However, don't be fooled by AMD calling their APU graphics HD 8000. The graphics are comparable to an integrated HD 6000 series GPU. This isn't terrible, but the naming is very misleading. Its okay for gaming on low-medium settings. If you want to upgrade to a nicer graphics card eventually, keep in mind that the slow processor will bottle neck anything too nice.<br /><br />EDIT: So the first processor I received was faulty and that was giving me issues. The turbo boost and power save features didn't work properly, so it was clocked at 1.75 most of the time, and didn't ramp up quick enough. It also failed Prime95 after a few minutes, so either the processor or the mother board was unstable. Amazon replaced both and were pretty great about it. Other companies don't touch them in customer service. After a few months with this processor, I'm still underwhelmed but it is much better than it was. For surfing the web or a budget HTPC, this processor is probably a good buy. It streams video well, and can handle a decent amount but you're gonna have some lag if you do any serious computing. Still, its about half the price of the A8, so its worth thinking about. The graphics are decent, and would likely be better if I had faster RAM. To the comment that said if I had faster RAM the processor would work better, that's not exactly true. The GPU part will work better, but the CPU part wont be that effected. I plan on upgrading it ASAP."
AF4EUWOFIR62Z6IC6DDS34RP6UCQ,B008D1JOLE,4,0,True,"First of all, this case comes with a low end logysis power supply, that's worth about 15 bucks. I was going to buy the same model PSU but saw that this case came with it and only cost about 13 dollars more, so I got it. My old case had terrible airflow.<br /><br />I've always bought cases between 20-30 dollars and they're usually adequate but disappointing. The metal is always very flimsy, there isn't very good airflow, etc. This case comes with a built in fan, and you could add one more on the side and there's a big vent below the fan expansion spot. These are nice features in a case cheap. The power button also has a nice click and isn't all mushy like these cheap cases usually have, and its got 4 USB inputs in the front. Usually you only get 2. The metal is pretty stiff, its no high end steal case but you don't feel like you're going to twist it in half every time you interact with it. The thumbscrews are a simple but nice touch, also. All things considered, this is a great buy for less than 30 bucks. The best one I've seen. However, there's a few nit-picky things that prevent it from getting 5 stars. I'd give it 4.5 if I could. I'm going to try and relay some information to help you get this thing set up better.<br /><br />First of all, straight out of the box the cable routing is very poorly thought out. Mine might have just been assembled wrong, because it is capable of better cable management. All the wires from the front of the case come out in awkward spots. The USB expansion plugs go through the top and all the front buttons and light cables come out over the hard drive bay. What you need to do is pop the front off the case and bring the usb cables down to the center cavity where the other cables are coming out. Then if you look at the bottom of the front, there's two oval holes that you can route the rest of the cables through. This prevents all of them from running over top of the motherboard and if you don't do this, at least on my microATX MSI board, the front audio connector will not reach. Also, while we're talking about the front connectors, this case comes with no documentation. Your motherboard manual will have the diagrams to plug everything in, but there's nothing indicating which side is ground. It doesn't really matter which direction the power and reset switches go because they're not polarized, it just completes a circuit. The LED ones, however, do matter. The lead with a small arrow over it on the plug is the positive lead. Make sure you know whether your motherboard uses AC 97 or the intel spec for sound on the front panels.<br /><br />Another small gripe I have is mostly with power supplies in general. Why do they never come with more than 2 sata plugs? The molex ones are all but obsolete. If you have 2 hard drives and an optical drive, you're gonna want to grab a cheap adapter cable. This isn't a huge deal but the cheap ones amazon offers as add on items, so its a good idea to add them to your order when you buy this case. Not a huge deal, just something to keep in mind.<br /><br />This case does a strange quirk where, when the computer is asleep, the power light blinks obnoxiously. Its also insanely bright. I'm not sure what this light is even for, since the power button is illuminated. I unplugged it, and problem solved. This is annoying if you sleep in the same room as your computer.<br /><br />The case also didn't come with enough risers to attach the mother board, and some of the holes are not even there. I pulled a few off another case, and its good to go but I worry a little about the motherboard not being attached as well as its intended to be. A few of the holes the case misses are on the edges, so the board could flex if you're not careful plugging stuff in. I am using a microATX board, not sure if you'd run into the same issue with a full ATX one. Those seem to be less common these days.<br /><br />Also, there's a very tiny gap on either side of my optical drive. Its not super noticeable but make sure you don't tighten one side too much while you're installing it or the gap will be really big on one side. Put the screws in most of the way on all four sides and then tighten them a little bit at a time on each side and the gaps should be even on both sides and it doesn't look as bad.<br /><br />Other than that, its fantastic. Because the metal is thicker, its quieter than some cheap cases and the included power supply seems to be fine and its relatively quiet too. If you're building a system on a budget, this is the best cheap case I've seen. Steer clear of the Rosewells that are a bit cheaper, they are basically made of aluminum cans."

I didn't think I would use fast scrolling that much, if at all, and it took me a few days to pinpoint the perfect sensitivity, but now I don't think I could live without it.<br /><br />Tracking is very smooth, and the DPI adjustment is very broad. It's also a great color (I got stone) and very comfortable to use."
AFADBODIC7NJ4RJE4QQPCGQ432SA,B082VJRK3Q,5,0,True,"In my quest to silence my gaming computer, I decided to replace the Wraith Spire stock cooler that came with my Ryzen 5 3600X. It was loud, even when it was idling.<br /><br />Reading and watching reviews and comparisons of budget CPU coolers, it was clear that the ARCTIC Freezer 34 eSports was a good all-around contender: quiet, cool, and budget-minded.<br /><br />And the reviewers and other users out there were right! It's definitely a lot quieter than the AMD stock cooler. And it even seems to do a better job at keeping my CPU temps down. While I forgot to do an immediate before and after of the temperatures, I want to say I'm seeing at least a 5°C difference while gaming (based on what I remember seeing in the past while using the stock cooler).<br /><br />Installation was pretty quick and easy. While there are no paper instructions included, there is a QR-code to the manufacturer website that has instructions and a super helpful video; highly recommend watching it. Since this can be used with AMD and Intel CPU sockets, it comes with a few sets of posts/standoffs for the different sockets. Pay attention to the markings/notches on the included posts so you know you're using the right ones for your socket. It can be a little tough putting the fan back onto the heat sink if you remove it/add another one; it's clasped on with these little wire bars, and the wire bars can sometimes pop out while securing the fan(s), which is annoying to pop-back in.<br /><br />This particularly model does not include RGB. Which I love! I don't turn off my computer at night, so the less light shining from my computer, the better.<br /><br />Happy to recommend this to anyone!"
AFADBODIC7NJ4RJE4QQPCGQ432SA,B08N62RM1N,5,0,True,Bought this for my Intel NUC 5i5RYH after the original fan started sounding like a propeller plane (had it for 5yrs and left it on almost 24/7; it's to be expected).<br /><br />Easy to replace and did so with the new one. Totally silent now. Thanks!
AG7HOY4ZWYXYTIR7U6FNQ5PLMZEA,B085M7VPDP,5,0,True,"Unlike most chip-only offers on Amazon, Newegg, etc, these look to be Intel chips.<br />If you are willing to have extra pieces (antennas, wires, brackets for a desktop installation) then this option is a good one for a laptop owner. I purchased 2 of these for older laptops after upgrading our home WiFi to WiFi 6, one with a 4th generation i7 Intel CPU (Dell XPS 13) and the other with an 8th generation Intel CPU (Dell Latitude 7490). For both the computer recognizes the WiFi chip correctly and indicates it is using WiFi6.<br />One worry was that the white and black connections seemed to be flipped compared to the previous WiFi chips (7260 and 8265) but WiFi works after placing the antenna wire to match the color of the triangle.<br />A recommended option for laptop WiFi upgrades!"

My company keeps providing the $40 Logitech and Plantronics headsets to employees.  Both of those are cheaply made, break quickly, regularly result in call issues and especially the plantronics is extremely uncomfortable when worn for more than an hour at a time.  I was hesitant to pay so much more for this Sennheiser headset but figured I'd keep the box and return it to Amazon if they turned out not to be worth it.<br /><br />I've had the Sennheisers for about 2 months now and have been worth every penny.  They're infinitely more reliable, have eliminated many mysterious call quality issues, are extremely comfortable even after wearing them all day, have an intelligently designed, solid remote (volume up, volume down, mute, end-call buttons) on the cord that comes with a little steel plate you can stick to your desk.  The remote has a magnet that sticks to the plate leaving enough cord to move around like I normally with with the added bonus that the remote is always exactly in the same place.  I absolutely love this headset.  It's worth every penny."
AFFGJHSUE7MG5QAG64N6FQ7YJZPA,B00BZC31WQ,5,1,False,"Overall, this is a great and convenient mouse, I love that I don't have to connect anything to the computer to use it. However, it is a bit heavy because it requires two batteries. It's the size of a regular desktop mouse, and fits comfortably in my hand. The buttons click a bit less sharply than others, which is a nice bonus. The scroll wheel scrolls up and down in notches, serves as a middle click, and can go left and right.<br /><br />Setting up the mouse is very simple, just follow the instructions in the box. However, if you want to change any of the default settings, you have to go through a bit of extra trouble. For example, I find the blue button's default features a bit annoying, as I don't switch between apps that often and I dislike the vibrate feature. You can change the button's functions with some software downloadable from Microsoft here: http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/d/sculpt-comfort-mouse. You can set the swipes to be &#34;back&#34; and &#34;forward&#34; in Windows Explorer and in your browser, which is convenient. You can also turn off the vibrate function.<br /><br />As for the intermittent connectivity problem other reviewers mentioned, I haven't had the same problem, but in case you do, you can search Windows for &#34;Device Manager&#34; &#62; Bluetooth &#62; Intel... &#62; Power Management, and uncheck the &#34;Allow computer to turn off this device&#34; box to solve it."
AFM54Q5ZLDI7IGKPUTGGS2JXMNNQ,B009VCAJ7W,4,4,True,"I used this to replace the stock Intel HSF on an LGA-1151 build with an i3-6100. The HSF is well-packaged and comes with a syringe of high-quality Noctua thermal paste. The syringe is more than adequate in size. Build quality is typically excellent for Noctua, and the heatsink base is cleanly milled and appears perfectly flat and polished. I'll make the following other notes:<br /><br />INSTALLATION: Very simple, with four thumbscrews that attach from underneath the motherboard. For this reason, if your case doesn't allow access to the underside of the motherboard, you should install the CPU and HSF before you put the board in the case. The screw-through design does work best if you can lay the board flat, put the HSF on top of the CPU (with thermal paste applied), and then put the screws through from underneath the board and sequentially screw them in. This can be a little bit of a balancing act, so I had to make some mini &#34;sawhorses&#34; out of cardboard boxes to allow the board to be flat and also allow me to access the underside to place the screws. The unit does precisely fit the boundaries of the LGA-1151 socket, so if your board is engineered to spec there should be no problems with fit.<br /><br />COOLING: About the same as the Intel stock HSF. Adequate for most of those who are not overclocking, but those who do probably will want a more robust cooling solution.<br /><br />NOISE: Extremely quiet, much more so than the stock Intel unit. Barely audible at baseline, and increases in speed are not very noticeable."
AFM54Q5ZLDI7IGKPUTGGS2JXMNNQ,B015VPX2EO,4,1,True,"Very power efficient, and runs cool. The specs are as outlined so I won't bother going into performance. My CPU installed and benchmarked just fine on my GA-H170N-WIFI motherboard.<br /><br />The standard Intel HSF is included. If you're not overclocking, and you have sufficient airflow in your case, this will be adequate for your needs. It installs very easily and has thermal paste pre-applied (be careful not to smear it when you handle the HSF, as it's packed unprotected). I will note however that the fan is noisy and has a terrible tonality (a high-pitched whine that audibly changes when the fan speeds up or slows down). The sound was unacceptable so I switched it out for the Noctua NH-L9I, which I've also reviewed elsewhere. It provided equivalent cooling with much less noise. I downgraded this review by one star for the fan noise."
AFM54Q5ZLDI7IGKPUTGGS2JXMNNQ,B015CQ8D9Q,5,2,True,"I bought this motherboard for a personal desktop build. My needs for power were rather limited as the most I would be doing would be playing some 4K video, otherwise just mostly desktop productivity applications and browsing, with no gaming at all. It has more than enough oomph for that with the integrated graphics, and with the i3 CPU I installed. The packaging is fine and the board has a few accessories, including the WiFi antenna and a SATA cable. Setup was easy and the board posted and booted without any issues. Here are some notes on specific issues:<br /><br />BOARD LAYOUT: The LGA 1551 socket is within spec, but without much tolerance around the borders because the USB 3.0 header is so close to the socket edge. For this reason you need to be careful about what heatsink you install. The Intel stock HSF fit fine, but I replaced it because the integrated fan is so noisy. I used the Noctua NH-L9I low-profile cooler. This fit fine, and is quiet, but is certainly not the most powerful cooler out there.<br /><br />SATA PORTS: the SATA EXPRESS ports, and hence, four of the available SATA ports, face forward (away from the back panel). In my NCASE M1 case, this meant that the ports were facing directly towards the PSU with very limited clearance. I was able to fit in right-angle SATA cables, but there is essentially no additional clearance there, so make sure you plan ahead if you want to use these. There are two SATA ports that face directly up, and these won't have the same problem, so if you just need two SATA ports you're fine.<br /><br />DOCUMENTATION: The headers and ports are all clearly marked and their functions are described, so if you have some building experience you should be fine here. The BIOS setup instructions are (as is typical) very poor, and refer to an old version of the BIOS.<br /><br />BIOS: The currently available BIOS is many, many versions ahead of the version that came installed on my board, so I'd flash it with the upgrade as soon as possible. The newer BIOS appears to work fine, recognized all the installed hardware, etc. Again, documentation here is poor, which is unfortunately typical.<br /><br />M.2 SSD slot: I liked the location of the slot, which is on the (cooler) underside of the board. In the NCASE M1, there's a vent on that side and it seems more than adequate for keeping the SSD cool. An M.2 screw is included, which is a nice touch. The BIOS recognized my SM 951 NVMe, and I was able to install Windows 10 without any issues, even on the old BIOS version that came installed. The default settings worked without any issues."
AFM54Q5ZLDI7IGKPUTGGS2JXMNNQ,B00XS423SC,5,2,True,"I bought this for a new mini-ITX desktop build, with an Intel H170 motherboard and i3 CPU, and an M.2 SSD as the primary boot drive. I mainly needed this amount of storage for my music and movie collection and this was by far the cheapest way to get 8TB of storage. These drives have limited writing abilities but I only planned to write the data on there once. The bare drive installed easily and was recognized by BIOS and Windows 10 without a problem. As others have noted, read speeds are fine, albeit nothing special. They're certainly adequate for serving 4K video files. However, the write speeds are indeed pretty abysmal when doing sustained file transfers. It took about 5 hours to transfer contents of one 500 GB USB drive. Even transferring over the SATA bus is really slow, indicating that the drive itself is the bottleneck. However, I'll take the tradeoff for the great value in terms of cost per TB.<br /><br />One thing you should be aware of is that there are only four mounting holes under the drive instead of the usual six, with the ones that are usually in the middle being omitted. This may cause some issues for you if you're mounting them in a bay that uses the bottom holes and requires the middle ones to be present. The side holes are situated normally and I was able to mount in a 3.5&#34; drive bay using these.<br /><br />A side note: some have said the drive gets very hot when writing, but in my well-vented system it wasn't a problem at all."

I had zero problem setting this up on Arch Linux and Windows 10. None. Nothing. Nada. The Windows 10 Intel Driver was apparently already installed and it just works with my R7000 wifi configuration (it automatically uses the ac connection). The Linux kernel has a built in driver and after I installed NetworkManager and nm-applet I configured it in three minutes. I am extremely impressed. The Network Manager connection properties claims it is connected at 400 Mb/s. True this is not the touted 1200 Mb/s of the AC standard. 400 Mb/s is ridiculous considering that an average SATA SSD will struggle to give you that throughput constantly. If I wanted a Gb/s connection I would go with wired ethernet. Other reviews are right: this doesn't come with a DVD/CD and you have to use one of your mobo USB headers for bluetooth. I will update the review if it flakes out, but so far I am very surprised and very satisfied."

AEDCPMDBWIEAKLJ772BQTFH77ALA,B08BF8YMXC,5,9,True,"This case is awesome, well designed, well made.  This was my first computer build, and my son, who has some experience, questioned my decision to go with the NR200P given the additional challenge of working in a small space--until he saw it in person.

Actually has some room to spare.<br /><br />The Kingston RAM has only about 2mm clearance from the cooling tower.  But 2mm is enough.<br /><br />My fan hub sits behind the front panel, nicely hidden, because it's not pretty.  I routed several things behind that panel.  You can also place SSDs there, but mine are both m.2, directly plugged into the MB, so that front panel was wide open for wires.<br /><br />I added two fans on the bottom and one at the back.  Based on my review of the ""literature"" (YouTube), the best airflow with a cooling tower is to intake from the bottom and back, and exhaust thru the top.  Including the fan in the center of my cooling tower, I have 6 fans in here and no problems with heat.  The two stock fans are on top.  I did add a magnetic filter on the back to block off the openings back there.  My computer sits right next to an air filter which is right next to a chinchilla cage, with hair and dust floating everywhere.<br />______________________________________<br /><br />Everyone talks about the challenge of routing the cables in such a small case.  For me, this was the fun part and I was very happy with the outcome.  Like I said, I'm a first time builder, so I have no experience.  Which means you can do it too.  You can decide based on the pics whether you think I did a decent enough job.<br /><br />Just ordered another NR200P for a surprise system for my dad.  Hope it goes as well as the first one, but if it doesn't, the problem won't be the case!  LOVE LOVE LOVE the colors, too!  I would've gone with pink if it hadn't been $50 more at the time of my build.  Even thought about getting one now and switching everything out, but decided not to rock the boat."

AEDCPMDBWIEAKLJ772BQTFH77ALA,B002IKLJU0,5,25,False,"When I finally decided on a megazoom, it came down to the Canon 20is (would have preferred the 10is, actually), and the FZ35.  I was able to have hands on time with the Canon first.  My top priority is picture quality, and it just didn't measure up.  Add to that its lack of filter threads (WHAT??!), no raw format, AA batteries (hate 'em), excessive size and weight, higher price, and past bad experience with a Canon, and I opted to buy the FZ35 sight unseen, risky as that was.  The reviews for this camera are really stellar, and well deserved.<br /><br />Some have said the FZ35 is lightweight, and because of that, feels cheap.  Personally, I don't need for my camera to be heavy/bulky to prove it is quality made--I need it to perform, and this one does. All the extra weight of those cameras that feel more ""quality"" starts to hurt when you've got your arms over your head waiting for your shot.<br /><br />Not many people have talked about the joystick.  I'm a big fan of joystick control, because it puts so many functions at the tip of your thumb, and accesses them quickly without having to move your hands around the camera.  Holding it in briefly gives you the Quick menu, where you can alter the stabilizer, metering mode, focus mode, white balance, ISO, intelligent exposure, file size, quality, and LCD options.  With the camera in Manual Mode, you can change the aperture and shutter speed in a split-second using the joystick.  (Those two parameters are displayed at the bottom of the screen, and I like that shutter speeds less than a second are displayed as a fraction, not as just the denominator of the fraction).  Half-press the shutter, and you get a meter showing over- or under-exposure.  This will slide as you alter your settings so you know where you stand.<br /><br />The manual focus is also done with the joystick, which is unique.  I like that you don't have to remove either hand from the camera in order to focus.  If you need to autofocus for the moment while in manual focus, you just press a little button on top and it's instantly done for you, while still keeping you in manual focus mode.  Nice way to cheat when you're in a hurry.  Ü<br /><br />I find the LCD nicely accurate.  On my old Piece-O-Junk Canon, I had to run in and load the pics on the computer to know what they really looked like, and often it was an unpleasant surprise.  It took way too many shots to get a few good ones.  I've had no such experiences with this camera.<br /><br />The battery pack is also a big PRO for me.  Regular AA batteries never quite pulled the weight of my Piece-O-Junk.  A lame camera became even lamer, and I hated dealing with all those AA's.  This nice little battery pack is wonderfully compact, easy to handle, and fits nicely into my camera case (Lowepro AW 160--holds my camcorder too), as does the included charger.<br /><br />Best of all, the picture quality is excellent.  I've taken over 800 pictures with the FZ35, mostly in Manual Mode, and have been nothing short of thrilled with the results.  I've finally got a camera that is a joy to use in so many ways.  The macro mode is incredible, BTW.  I've also gotten good results indoors without flash, but in my dark house that requires manual control and sometimes a tripod (or skip all that and just use the flash).  What this not-so-little gem has accomplished is nothing short of incredible.<br /><br />The FZ35 is so capable and gives you so much control, it's almost a bit of a waste to use it in Auto mode.  I would strongly encourage you to plug thru the manual, buy a book on digital photography if needed, and experiment.  This is a sophisticated camera with many options, some of which you just simply won't discover without reading the manual.<br /><br />I haven't used the movie function at all, so can't comment on that.<br /><br />Sample photos can be viewed at [...].  When viewing a shot, note the camera used in the right column, as my old junk cameras (Canon and Olympus) have shots up there too.  Also remember that I am totally an amateur attempting a little more serious photography.<br /><br />Summed up in seven words, I LOVE IT, LOVE IT, LOVE IT!!"

AE6HWLIIYWGLLAMMXFOEXD2N6B7Q,B09QY2PXP1,4,18,True,"Normally I build my own rigs but since the pandemic pushed off any upgrades for enough years, it was finally time to admit that this time I just needed a completely new system-- and hopefully one with a semi-decent upgrade path.<br />This bad boy isn't anything fancy but, honestly? It is a faaaar better choice than I expected to find for the listed price. Are there concessions made? Of course there are *BUT*, almost all of them are the exact same concessions *I* would have made myself if I were building this rig.<br />So, that being said, strap in and pull on your waders cause this is about to get detailed as we're going into every weed possible...<br /><br />1) CPU/Motherboard<br />It seems almost unfair to review the motherboard as those will probably change depending on availability/pricing at the time that any particular run of a machine is put together. That being said, both the models mentioned in comments and the question section and the one that my own unit arrived with are pretty danged comparable. Like, almost identical except for minor and unimportant details from equally reputable manufactures that it honestly might as well be the same board: comparable.<br /><br />Opening it up and seeing that made me feel better about my purchase immediately.<br /><br />Both the MSI others have mentioned and the Asus that I got myself support the usual things: USB 3.4, dual chan RAM, overclocking, etc, etc, etc. Both also have a fairly decent upgrade path as well. RAM and even the CPU can be changed out for better/more as needed/desired.<br /><br />This is obviously the first compromise they made that I would have.<br /><br />Firstly, we're in an odd place right now in that the gen 10 CPU is actually preferable to the later generations (up to 13 at the time of writing this) because, well, the other generations run dangerously hot for anything but water cooled systems resulting in thermal throttling. This means that unless you want to mess with the added expense of water cooling, you *will* be thermally throttled and so, will just be wasting your money for some better looking numbers on a spec sheet. In actual usage, a lot of folks have reported worse performance in later generations.<br /><br />So, yeah. Gen 10 is cheaper and better right now making me wonder whether or not it even *counts* as a compromise. Regardless though, switching over to Gen 13 and dropping in a water cooler when the time comes in a few years is easily doable as this board will handle that with no problem.<br /><br />At least, this way, when the inevitable o-ring failure or other leak trashes the whole thing, it'll be old enough that the loss wouldn't be an expense that's not going to be needed to be by that point (a few years into the future) anyways.<br /><br />The other compromise is, of course, that RAM. Again though.... *is* it a compromise? *Really*?<br /><br />8 GB is nowhere *near* enough, don't get me wrong but, otoh, the *first* thing *anyone* does when upgrading is get new/more RAM. Heck, a lot of folks automatically throw a RAM upgrade into the cart right along with the computer they're getting without so much as a second thought. RAM in the computer world is that cheap pair of ear buds that come with your phone-- it's just there so you can check to see that whatever you just bought actually works. ;P<br /><br />So, yeah, better to wait for a good sale on whatever kit you want, really. Whether you're going for pure speed or that pretty, pretty RGB, you can get along with the 8 GB just fine until you can scrape together the cash for it. Or throw it into the cart before you hit the ""buy"" button, whatever floats your boat.<br /><br />2) GPU (Graphics Card)<br />It never ceases to astound me that folks are insisting on pixels they can't even see despite the fact that it causes costs that they can definitely feel with computing overhead they can consistently struggle with. smh.<br /><br />Look, check out LTT (Linus Tech Tips) over on YouTube if you want the full rundown on that but, suffice it to say that you have to have either a 75 inch television, sit less than a foot from the monitor *and* have perfect or better than 20/20 vision as well as be young enough to not need reading glasses in order to tell the difference between 1080p and 4k.<br /><br />Seriously. Look up those videos-- they even had some e-athletes that could not tell the damned difference. At all.<br /><br />You know what *can* tell the difference? My GD wallet. So, yeah, 3050 is juuuuuust fine.<br /><br />As for FPS, you know what? At 24 years old (yes, 24!) your reflexes start to slow down. Since I am well above that, I can barely use 60-- much less anything over that. So, yeah, it ain't the hardware that's the reason why game devs target 30 FPS and needless to say that makes the 3050 another solid ""compromise"" I would have made *anyways*.<br /><br />3) Case<br />I don't think I'm ever going to stop being torn on this one to be absolutely honest. The front USB ports are only 3.0. But, otoh, the motherboard ports on the back are all 3.4 so, I guess that it depends on what you're going to plug in and where, I suppose.<br /><br />Obviously, a set of headphones, a mic or a small flash drive isn't going to need the speed that a large external would and it *is* a nice looking case so, again, it's a compromise I would have made. I mean, at some point, coolness has *got* to count for *something* and 2 slightly slower but still decent USB ports where I'm not even going to notice the difference is worth the trade off.<br /><br />Outside of that, it's a good case. I don't know Thermaltake as well as I do other companies but they do seem to be pretty reputable and the case is actually pretty nicely designed. Everything is easy to get to, upkeep (getting rid of dust) is easy to do, cord management features are intelligently placed so... there's really only one tiny niggle on my end-- which has absolutely 0 bearing on the quality of the case in question.<br /><br />For those who are curious, there are places for 2 SSDs in the case but only 1 HDD... As someone who has a relative ton of movies and a media server that I run off my main computer... That kinda caused me to wince a little.<br /><br />*To be fair though*, it's probably about time that I start upgrading to SSDs even if it *is* only just movies and music that I'm keeping on there. Yes, I would prefer to stick with the cheaper and longer lasting HDDs but, at the end of the day, times change and most folks want SSDs to hold their games libraries more than they want HDDs to hold old movies.<br /><br />So.... that's obviously a ""me"" problem and, after dutifully yelling at the kids to get the heck off my lawn, I'll STFU about that now. Just... other ""old farts"" take note that you might need/want an external for backup if you're insisting on wanting more than one hard disk drive instead of using solid states. Moving on.<br /><br />4) Power Supply and Peripherals<br />Normally, these aren't exactly aspects that go together in looking at a computer but, in this case? They kinda do because once I got everything opened up, I could tell that some $$$ was taken from the PSU an put into the keyboard and mouse.<br /><br />This is the one and only compromise that I wouldn't have made for myself but, otoh, I can *easily* see a solid case for their deciding to go the other way-- so, I'm honestly not even sure that this is a criticism so much as a minor-- if not outright petty, quibble.<br /><br />I have a wonderful keyboard and mouse set already so, obviously, I would have preferred to see a bit more oomph in the PSU than a nice set that I'm going to just toss *BUT*, that being said, as a starter computer, I can see the point.<br /><br />Power supply units, not unlike RAM are easy to replace/upgrade. In fact, 9 times out of 10, once you start upgrading anything other than the RAM- you're probably going to need to change out the PSU for something larger anyways so... I can see the point in going with something more modest here too. In exchange, the money saved there very obviously went into the keyboard and mouse.<br /><br />Like the earbuds, in-box peripherals are usually bottom of the barrel. These do *not* feel like it. Is it a real mechanical? No but, otoh, neither is the nicer one I've got.<br /><br />Fake-mechanicals are perfectly respectable for those of us that aren't into custom keycaps or happen to be switch snobs. Since most folks think that they're called ""cherry mx switches"" because something inside the keyboard is red (ha ha!)-- just feeling nice and being responsive is really all you need and yes, the keyboard feels better than what you normally get in the box with a computer like this.<br /><br />While I didn't get the chance to use it extensively, I *did* plug it in and checked it out. Keys are nicely clacky, travel is good and spacing feels nice. Flex is minimal which is a silent testament to good manufacturing. Also a good detail is the open design which is good for upkeep/cleaning as we all wind up eating something at the computer sooner or later and crumbs do indeed happen. lol.<br /><br />The mouse has a good heft and decent enough shape. It's not exactly my preference but, I was actually mildly impressed to see the side buttons on it as well. So, yeah, everything works there and is better than what you normally see.<br /><br />So. It's not like the money saved in the slightly lesser PSU was wasted. It's also not like the PSU that's in the computer doesn't run the computer itself perfectly well. I just know that for my own personal situation-- the keyboard and mouse aren't needed and a slightly better PSU would have been better apricated.<br /><br />Even there though, I can't knock the decision they made here. Yeah, granted, for me it's a compromise but for someone else who might need at least a middling keyboard/mouse-- it might be a godsend. So. That's a YMMV. That brings us at long last to the final thing to look at when getting a computer:<br /><br />5) Build Quality<br />First, a personal aside: Whoever thought to put the sticker onto the back of the unit with the reminder to not try to plug the monitor into the motherboard GPU as well as an arrow pointing to the 3050?<br /><br />I may know how to build a computer but, human memory is fallible. So while I honestly cannot say that I would have forgotten that little detail because your sticker reminded me before the question even came up, it was still a smart touch even if I wouldn't have forgotten that. After all, I have family that are systems analysts and everyone has made that forgetfulness-caused mistake more than once over the years so, good call. roflmao.<br /><br />As for the build itself, I have absolutely 0 complaints-- even the cord management is very well handled. Ties where there should be ties and only where there should be ties, everything was seated properly so it booted up right away.  All in all: A+. Nothing to report other than it's a really good detail to see when you open up a machine.<br /><br />Booting it up, the only updates that were needed were the most recent ones and there really wasn't any bloatware- all of the icons on the desktop had a strictly valid reason to be there. Considering how bad certain big named computer makers can be about that (*cough, cough* HP *cough, cough*...)<br /><br />That was actually refreshing. Serious kudos on that.<br /><br />TL;DR/ Wrap UP<br />So. All-in-all, this is a really decent starter/modest system well worth the money. It's not overpriced and there are absolutely *no* unlivable compromises here.<br /><br />And, let's be honest: at this price point? It's honestly unusual to find that kind of combination.<br /><br />Seriously, manufacturers make unrealistic promises or even just outright lie on the contents hoping that the person buying a new system like this won't know the difference and this system isn't even *remotely* like that.<br /><br />I mean, there's not even any obvious bottlenecks that isn't standard/expected by anyone buying a new computer here-- CPU is the most stable currently on the market, graphics might be considered middle-of-the-road but, again, at this point, middle-of-the-road is going to be just fine for 90-95% of folks not trying to compensate for coming up short somewhere else and there is a solid and respectable upgrade path here that won't see you needing to change out that motherboard anytime soon.<br /><br />So, yeah. This isn't the computer equivalent of a lambo but, then again, lambos are way overprices, temperamental as heck and *very* expensive and time consuming to maintain. Naaaaw, if you want solid performance with little fuss-- you *gotta* go with a sedan because that's exactly what they're built for. And that's what this computer is built for too.<br /><br />It may not ""win any races"" but, it's got enough ""under the hood"" to get you ""to work and back"" and maybe do a little ""joy driving."" And, even more importantly (as well as to drive-- hehe this analogy into the ground): it won't need to be ""towed"" into the shop all the danged time either.<br /><br />It's a good, solid computer at a good price and if this unit is any indication as to the types of computers and build quality that these guys put out-- not only would I buy again but, probably will as the significant other will be needing a new computer as well soon enough.<br /><br />Thanks."

When you read the description it tells you that 3 have intelligent charging capabilities but it doesn't clearly tell you the other ports are a dud when hooked up to AC power.

The Intel CPU was bad.  Intel replaced the CPU, ASUS test the mobo (good) and we are getting things operational again after four month of diagnostics returns."
AH3I7NWJHPF46JBYNLCG5DQCGRMA,B012M8LXQW,5,4,True,06/18/2016..  Only the best for my new mobo system<br />09/09/2016.  This unit went bad and was replaced by Intel.  It's a complex process but follow their guidance and they do replace defective units. Just got the replacement and will try again.  Had to have ASUS test the mobo to prove the CPU was defective. ASUS tested the mobo and returned it to me as it was good.  I installed the new CPU and it boots fine.  I configured the systems it is running well.  It's been four months.  I will still use Intel.
AH3I7NWJHPF46JBYNLCG5DQCGRMA,B016A44CU8,1,3,True,"1023/2016. Reinstalled the mobo and it's working but I've not connected the GPU or any additional capabilities. Running VGA. Uninstalled AI3, as other have had issues with it. I'll test for a week.<br /><br />10/22/2016. Update.  This  ASUS ROG Maximus Extreme VIII LGA1151 Wi-Fi M.2 U.2 USB 3.1 Z170 (mobo) has been a disaster, so far. The current mobo (third replacement) failed after a couple of weeks and would not boot at all with a Q-code of 00 when first installed. Asus returned it to their technical support facility, tested it to find No Trouble Found (NTF) and sent it back to me. We have repeated this exercise twice for this mobo and it's now back for the third reinstall. Now they want me to reinstall and systematically test by slowly over time adding components to see if it will work.  This is ASSUMING IT EVEN BOOTS, in the first place.  Research on ASUS ROG Blog shows that many others have similar issues with this mobo.  At this point I'm VERY DISSAPPOINTED but since I've invested $500 in this mobo, $350 in the processor, $350 in memory, $200 in new PS, and $300 in new graphics card, I must continue to try and get it working.  To be continued...<br /><br />05/22/2016. First MOBO would not recognize any keyboard, at least that was what it appeared.  ASUA Tech Support diagnosed and said MOBO was defective and to return it. 2nd MOBO is in route for delivery in two days. Amazon return policy is great. I'll re-evaluate after the next install, assuming it works.<br />06/11/2016.  After much ado the second mobo was installed and determined that the first one was good after all, but the ASUS Tech Support was in error. An older ASUS Graphics processor Unit (GPU) that I carried over from the previous mobo was NOT WIN 10 compatible, even though it was thought to be ok.  Once removed from the mobo it booted to BIOS correctly. Everything worked fine except the LAN and with ASUS Tech support assistance we diagnosed, uninstalled the LAN driver, updated the Intel Chipset driver and reinstalled the Intel LAN driver. Then it all worked well.  I researched and ordered a new one GPU (ASUS STRIX Radeon R9 390) and it works very well. Now to update all the many drivers and finish installing the extra features of hardware that come with this great mobo. I'll add more info later when it all done.<br /><br />06.23.2016.  Update.....The mobo died. Spent almost three hours on the phone with ASUS Tech Support running various diagnostic testing, including removing the mobo from the case and running additional bench tests with nothing connected, including removal of the processor testing.  Conclusion: mobo is defective and must be returned. Contacted amazon.com who adjusted their return policy as the mobo was at the 30 day return limit when it failed and it was now day 31.  New board was ordered and will be delivered same day (6/24/16), then I return the defective one to amazon returns.  Amazon.com has been great.  The ASUS mobo was great while it worked for three weeks. I hope the next one lasts longer.  I like ASUS mobo and their Tech Support. I certainly have learned a lot. I'm getting very proficient in installation and removal procedures.<br />I update this saga later for follow-up.<br /><br />7/3/2016.  Apparently it was not the mobo that was defective but the Intel i7 6700K processor. Returned the processor and bought a new one.  It works fine, as does the mobo. If all goes well. I won't further update this review; just enjoy the products.<br /><br />8/17/2016. The third MOBO failed and being returned via RMA again, However, ASUS has no more replacements and we are working for an alternative mobo replacement; perhaps a Z170-DELUXE. as it will handle the Intel i7-6700K and G.SKILL mem I bought. We shall see how his works out.  I'm very saddened at the results. ASUS Tech Support has been VERY GOOD.  Changing the rating to Three Stars.<br /><br />9/9/2016.  ASUS fully tested the returned mobo and it is good, so they sent it back to me.  It turns out the Intel CPU was defective and Intel replaced that. I initially reinstalled the mobo and new Intel CPU and everything booted OK. I'll config the system and things should go good from now on....I hope. Restoring my review to 5-stars, since the ASUS product was NOT defective after all. Intel will replace CPUs that go bad but the process is complex.<br /><br />09/17/2017.  MOBO died again.  Have not had great results with this mobo.  Frequently have to reboot due to strange behavior.  Had to remove as much ASUS software as possible to get it to work. I. at the point of replacing it with  Less-complex board in hopes that it will preform better  I going to try the AUSU STRIK Z270F gaming mobo. We'll see how it goes."

I've put the blowers beside (my case supports a PCI slot oriented sideways) and over the video card because without the blowers, hot air will be used by my CPU radiator (I use a closed loop water cooling for my CPU).

AGEEZVS4Q7JLPXMVS3YJNGA5BUTA,B09HDJ3Z47,5,9,True,"The cooler was very easy to put on. It uses the default AMD back bracket that came with your board if you are using AMD. If its Intel, it comes with an intel back bracket. It also comes with the front brackets that you will need. The set up was pretty straight forward, it doesn't come with a paper manual, you have to scan the QR code on the inside lid of box with your phone to get to the manual. Then just follow the setup. If you are using this cooler, make sure you have iCUE V4 installed. This cooler needs iCUE V4 to run and be configured properly. Just google iCUE 4 and you should find the download. I recommend top or front mounting this and setting it up as an intake to get maximum cooling. Make sure your fans are pointed the right direction. Also make sure the top of the radiator is higher than your processor so that you can avoid any air bubbles that might be in the radiator from being sucked into the pump."

I used nylon spacers from the hardware store to act as standoffs to keep the board from flexing.

It has out performed my former system and I am very satisfied with the overall performance. I would recommend this to a friend.

AHNVG7TX6SUUKPOLBZRF3S3FOLTA,B00TWFHY1C,3,7,True,"These days consumers need an in house resident IT expert to make digital devices  work in the home. This is the case with Samsung TVs as well. Samsung announced that all of their TVs would run on the Tizen operating system instead of the them having to pay a licensing fee for Android or iOS. Why, one might ask, does a TV need an operating system? It is because TVs are now quite complex and perform much more than the TVs of yesteryear. If they are to deliver the content and connect to your home network they must have some intelligence and that means computing power.<br /><br />The problem Samsung runs into is that almost no other devices run on Tizen and they are being short sighted because they want to own all aspects of the consumer experience. This ultimately just frustrates the consumer in the way you must relearn how to use a TV.<br /><br />That said, the picture is really quite good and the curved shape definitely adds to the viewing experience. So at the end of the day this TV is not a bad choice. Samsung does know how to make the great hardware. That said, their user interface to get the so called &#34;Smart TV&#34;  working is wanting. This is because you must input keystrokes using their puny little TV remote. They have a voice interface to enable voice commands but that too is kluggie  at best. This is another case where Samsung should have just partnered with someone who knows how to do voice interfaces. Once I &#34;educate myself&#34; on all things Samsung, I will come back to give an update on this review. If you buy this one, make sure you install it with your most geekiest of friends."

After purchasing this item, and using it for several days, I am very happy with my purchase. This device can actually support video resolutions much higher than my built in video card, allowing me to connect to monitors with better than HD resolution.<br /><br />I tested this card on both a windows 7 and windows 8 system, and found the installation a breeze. You can just plug it in without installing the driver from the CD: as long as you have the option to download the latest drivers for hardware enabled. The display output is high quality, with no flicker, or other imperfections.<br /><br />I tested the display under different conditions in Windows 8 and noticed that when playing a Netflix video in Google Chrome browser on an Intel I7 3rd generation @ 2.5Ghz. What I found was that the Display Link Manager process, which is essential the video driver for this product, was utilizing between 15% and 20% of my processor time. I'm not saying whether this is good or bad, it's just an observation. Remember, you are outputting video, through your USB 3.0 port, and something has to process all that data. I noticed no slowdown while playing the video. In summary, I was very impressed by performance of this device.<br /><br />When not playing video, the CPU utilization of the driver was relatively low depending on the application on the VGA monitor. The more the screen changes, the higher the CPU has to work to render the video. The most video driver utilization was about 24%, but that was playing a video game, which normally you would probably want to do on your main screen.<br /><br />Summary: The device is awesome especially if you have a newer computer and USB 3.0. I would highly recommend it!!!"
AEF45Q645WF45D5UV53JXUBO35UQ,B001BN17XY,3,0,True,"I have been thinking to build a small server to replace an old Synology DS107 for our small office. It is not mainly for HTPC, but a server that we can use as RAID-protected file, VPN, streaming, web, and a testing VM (Sun VirtualBox) Server. I really think most NASs nowadays are over-priced. Not only that, we lost the control to compile and run apps (eg. Apache & MySQL) from source codes. Since we will need to keep it on 24/7, it has to be small, quite, and consume low power. After months of research, I finally decided to make my move for this board, plus the Chenbro 4-bays chassis. We have a Win2k8R2 license, 4 of WD Green 2TB HDDs, and a Q9550 sitting around; so I believed it would be a good tiny powerful server. Even the 4G RAM limitation is kind of a worry for me, but I don't think I would really need to go beyond that at this point with the projects we have on hand now.<br /><br />It took me around 45 minutes, carefully, putting the board into the chassis. Then very first thing I realize is that the mobo doesn't boot. After over an hour of trouble shooting, and another few hours on Google, I found out that this mobe DOESN'T support Q9550, but Q9550s. Yes, the mobo doesn't support TDP CPU over 65W. You would ask ""why didn't you go to Intel web site and check the CPU supports list first?"" Yes, I did went to Intel website on Oct-2009, and I was 100% sure Q9550 was in the list. But now it is gone. Ok, never mind, it is a good excuse for me to replace the old E6750 for my workstation. Then, second catch, the 4 SATA ports on the mobo doesn't match the number on the manual. Easy fix. Not problem. Just wasted me another 2 minutes to correctly connect the ports to the right position. Then, ok, a 6TB RAID-5 volume is ready; and Windows 2008 R2 disc boots up. Wait... Windows Server cannot install into the RAID volume? Microsoft doesn't support ICH10R? Driver issue? Then, another hour on Google. Finally, it turns out ICH10R DOESN'T support bootable volume over 2TB. So, the 2TB HDDs on hand, the RAID feature has become useless, unless we don't mind wasting 2 of 2TB to setup RAID-1. We do mind; and this is the deal killer.<br /><br />My thought is, the mobo is really work as what it is designed for - home use HTPC. You should not test its limit to build a server like this. It is a good mobo after all, but just doesn't fit what we need. And I was surprised that Intel and Amazon do not mention about the 2TB volume issue in the website. So now, the mobo is returned; and we are wondering if we should put some budget for DH57JG, a new i5-670, plus 4G of DDR3."

It does not work the same way with Ring Smart Lighting.<br /><br />I finally got a Customer Service Rep from Ring in online chat; after arguing the same points with her for 20 minutes ~ she asked for a screen shot of my notification history. She took it to a supervisor and 5 minutes later she let me know I was correct. The developer of the Smart Lighting app for ring ~ step lights; spot lights;  path lights; flood lights etc.  CANNOT BE DELETED FROM YOUR PHONE, TABLET, DESKTOP OR LAPTOP unless they also have a camera, such as  ~ the floodlight cam or spotlight cam.<br /><br />The notification history is stored in the cloud for ring and then deleted every 60  days. By then I expect to have over 4,000 notifications. I am aggravated and angry. Shame on Ring Developers for dropping the ball, creating a flawed app; in their rush to get it on the market and rake in $$$$$ they got lazy.

My main criteria, beyond just being good quality, was front panel usb 3.0 which this case has.  The sleek flat black look and good price were the deal closers.<br /><br />We have few complaints.  Everything fit, no sharp edges, opens and closes easily, etc.  Plenty of choices for where and how to mount fans.  The installation diagrams left a lot to be desired but fortunately the cables were reasonably labeled and even neophytes like us were able to figure out where to attach what. (Fortunately the mother board documentation was better). Some reviews reported damage on delivery but ours was perfect.<br /><br />Minor complaints: poor documentation, as I said; the 3.5 drive installation bays have a clever screwless design but we struggled with how to get them to work; the card slot covers were a bear to get off.  All in all though we are satisfied, especially for the price.<br /><br />The description of this didn't make it clear (to me, at least) that it comes with a blue LED fan, which was a nice bonus.<br /><br />I think convention dictates that we are supposed to list our build components: ASRock z87 extreme 4 mobo; corsair 600w ps; intel i5 4760k CPU; coolermaster hyper evo 212 CPU fan; and an old low end gpu too embarrassing to list (budget ran out before we got to the graphics card!)"

I was scared it was a bad USB Bridge but it was the flaky third party charger. It took me a few days to figure that out.<br /><br />Pro: Wow. I only found ONE (1) technical problem. The charger. That’s it. One. And I already had a charger so that was easy. I decided to run the diagnostics (startup CMD-d I believe) and it found no issues. It came with a custom image on it or maybe the previous owners image (corporate). I did an Internet restore instead. Unfortunately, I didn’t realize this until after the first setup. So I had to wipe and restore once again. Tip: If you ever get a used mac, I recommend doing an internet restore. The internet restore downloads the image of macOS that shipped with computer. (Should have followed my own advice)<br /><br />The drive does not seem to have a lot of wear on it. It’s a bit harder for me to accurately tell on NVME tho.  The battery had ~300 out of 1000 full charge cycles. Which is high based if it were based on my usage, but probably normal for others.<br /><br />The MacBook AIr itself is in near mint condition. (Will try to post photos) The keyboard was definitely used a bit. I could see the oil stains on the keys but other than that. This thing even smelled new. On top of it, it’s still under freaking warranty!!!!! I mean… yeah. Warranty on top of the slightly used condition. Can’t beat that for the price.<br /><br />I really wanted a higher end Intel MacBook. One with more Intel cores. Bigger screen because I am not yet ready for the M1 macs.  The older Intel MBPro are not in my budget right now. Given the heat from this version of MBAir, it might be for the best. From what I’ve read about the M1 Pro, they get just as hot due to the GPU cores. When did 90C become an acceptable temperature?<br /><br />Anyway, this will replace my 2014 MacBook Air. I’m totally fine with that. I went from dual core (4 thread) to quad core (8 thread). From 4GB ram to 16GB.

Sure, there are certain novelties that will wear off (i.e. ""Alexa, tell me a joke""), but for the most part, you'll find yourself using it more often over time as you realize its potential. Features are getting added all the time, and there are literally thousands just waiting to be discovered. These are known as ""skills"", which are apps and/or functions you are enabling the Dot to perform. Think of it as going into the app store on your phone and downloading a new app. There will be a lot of useless and buggy items to choose from, but there are plenty of time-saving, helpful options too! There are also hundreds of articles and videos out there to help you get started and find what's most useful to you.<br /><br />Design - 4.5 stars<br />--You'll be surprised as to just how compact the Dot really is, especially the 2nd generation version. It's lightweight, well-packaged, and easy to setup. You simply install the app on your smartphone or other device with Wi-Fi, plug in the Dot, and follow a few easy steps to get it connected. For most, this will take less than 20 minutes, though you'll spend far more time admiring its simplistic design and discovering what it can do!<br />--Slight deduction in the fact that it doesn't have a built in battery, so it's not portable without purchasing a third-party accessory.<br /><br />Ease of use - 4.5 stars<br />The app features a variety of settings you can tweak, including the ability to customize which sources (or apps) that Alexa uses for things like news and music. One of the first to customize is your daily briefings. Then set your favorite music service as the default (at the time of this writing in 2017, Amazon Music and Spotify are two mainstream options available with more on the way). Simply ask Alexa to play a local radio station where you live and it will start streaming, though you may need to visit the radio station's website to find the right command. Customization is very intuitive and the options to choose from are extensive!<br /><br />Performance - 4 stars<br />--The Dot turns on and loads quickly from the time you plug it in, ready to serve at your beck and call within about 45 seconds. That's impressive if you think about how long it takes other devices you use on a daily basis to startup. When you ask (or command it) in a way the device understands, responses are lightning quick. On average, I found questions like, ""Alexa, what movies are playing nearby?""; and ""Alexa, what's the weather like tomorrow?"", receiving replies within 2-3 seconds. It's ability to understand a variety of enunciations from various family members was also impressive. Rarely has it misunderstood the words and phrases we've spoken.<br />--Point deduction for overall intelligence: The type of questions you can ask is somewhat limiting (in 2017). When you ask Alexa to think and compare, she buckles at the knees. Alexa relies on quickly contacting an Amazon server to check for recognized logic about a question you've just asked. More often than not, random questions are just too complex. For example, you can ask what the largest city is in your state, but if you try a comparison between two cities asking which is larger, Alexa shrugs her shoulders. Other times, you'll ask what seems like a simple question and get the same confused reply. Not a deal-breaker, but it can be frustrating in the sense that it's supposed to be a ""smart"" device. But to be fair, other smart assistants are limited too, though Google Home and Siri have an edge over Alexa so far.<br /><br />Value - 5 stars<br />--Arguably, the biggest thing the Dot has going for it is its price! You're getting a dedicated, always on assistant that makes life easier (or makes you lazier, depending on your perspective) often for less money than one night of eating out with the family. Echo devices also give you access to special Prime deals that the general public and other Prime members can't see. Every day, there are roughly 30 or so random deals available up to an additional 50% off, and they change all the time.<br /><br />Overall - 4.5 stars<br />--Definitely a product worth every penny and then some. Although there's always room for improvement, it seems Amazon is making the right moves by keeping its resources focused on the platform with constant updates and fixes. If you haven't already, it's time to make the jump onto the Amazon Echo bandwagon!"

I was hesitant at first because the Dell website says the maximum memory was 8GB.  But I researched the processor to confirm the compatibility and found that the processor actually supports up to 32GB.  Installation was easy on this model and I first booted to bios and confirmed the new amount of memory.  After that, Windows 7 pro 64-Bit started up so fast that it couldn't play the whole startup sound and now plays only a portion of the sound.  There were no issues at all and all my apps and navigation enjoyed a huge speed increase.  As long as your processor (and OS) is compatible with this amount of memory, you'll have no issues and enjoy the speed increase.

AHENALE25EXP3M7QWZRXIYKTTFPQ,B003XU76QK,5,3,True,"Headline:  ""Office equipment and cell phones radiate RFI noise!  Since you can't avoid it, ADAPT!  Here's how.""<br /><br />My application for the recorder is as a phone recorder.<br /><br />As the headline states, ""RFI"" (AKA: Radio Frequency Interference) is nearly impossible to avoid in the presence of typical office equipment like computers, power supplies, routers, monitors, printers, etc. Pretty much any digital device in a home or office environment will emit electrical noise through the air and wiring. Also, include any operating cell phones.  The trick is to orient the recorder a minimum of two-feet, or more from the obvious devices mentioned above. Distance is the key! I use an RJ11 phone extension cord and RJ11 cord-splice (both available at Amazon) to give me placement options.  Also I set my RECORD Gain to ""Low"" (pg 4 in the manual) and the ""Rec level"" ring (front panel) to 12-oclock. These settings reduce the recorder's sensitivity to internal and external background noise. Next, I chose ""192bps"" for my REC Quality (pg 07). Lastly, I moved the recorder's power supply as far away as it's cord length would allow. That's it, that's all I had to do to get EXCELLENT recorded phone conversations in both directions. I tried personal recorders from Zoom, Tascam, Olympia and Sony with a $16 hand-set adapter (Amazon). That device takes the mono signal from the phone's handset jack. The results were consistently noisy and required additional external editing to get the volume to an intelligible level. For my needs, the Sangean DAR-101 recorder gets my recorded phone conversations right without any additional editing."

AFMBU6EIYXQPDKQLPCEQLC2JCG5A,B00CFCTDMC,5,1,False,"Here are the things that make this camera exceptional:<br />- Small.  The best camera is the one you have with you, and this is small enough to always be.<br />- Image quality.  Don't compare this to a DSLR or even a mirrorless, unless you actually take one of those with you regularly.  What you should compare this to is a cell phone camera.  I have a 16MP Galaxy S5 and comparing them side by side, the LF1 low-light quality is amazing compared to the grainy S5.<br />- Intelligent ISO.  My NEX-F3 has auto ISO, but if it can't reach 1/60s shutter it keeps increasing ISO to 3200.  The LF1 increases ISO to 400, then drops shutter speed until it reaches the speed that you customize as the minimum speed, before increasing ISO again to up to 1600.  It also increases ISO if it senses your subject is moving, and in practice this seems to increase ISO by up to 1 full stop if it senses movement, allowing shutter speed to also increase by 1 stop.  This is awesome, since I will gladly trade a slight increase in ISO noise if I would have otherwise missed a moment due to motion blur.<br />- Adjustable AF area size.  At first I didn't think this was adjustable, but it actually is if you hit ""disp"" while in the AF Mode menu for 1-Area AF.  You can make it quite small so you know exactly what point the AF is using.<br />- Step zoom. I usually hate electronic zoom, but I love that I can set this to exactly 35mm, then move to exactly 28mm or 50mm with one click of the front ring.  FYI, you can turn this feature off if you prefer imprecise ""Wayne's World"" type zooming instead.<br />- Lens focal length resume. You can set the camera to return to your last used focal length every time you turn the camera on.  ""Hello 35mm f2.4, you're right where I left you.""<br />- EVF.  If you hate bright sunlight making you strain to see the rear screen of your camera, it's so nice to just click EVF mode, frame your shot, and go on with your day.  True, it's not high enough quality to want to use it all the time, but that isn't the point of it being there.<br /><br />Other good features:<br />- The low-light AF is quick and doesn't seem to hunt (unless you've set it to macro AF).  One of the reasons I didn't buy an RX100 MarkIII is some of the reviews mentioning a disappointing AF, and I already find my NEX-F3 to have disappointing AF so that seems likely true, though I didn't actually try it (aside from in the super brightly lit Best Buy, which obviously hides any low-light performance issues).<br />- Built-in WiFi lets me transfer photos to my phone, and use my phone as a remote with live view.<br />- Very effective image stabilization.  I've never taken so many blur-free shots at 1/4s shutter speed.<br />- I was able to get it for about half the retail price.<br /><br />Room for improvement:<br />- Grip.  While it doesn't come with a front grip, you can buy an adhesive grip that works surprisingly well.  I use the Flipbac G3, but I may try the larger Flipbac G2 in the future.  Either way, buy one of these immediately.<br />- Battery life.  I would recommend getting two extra batteries if you want to be out all day shooting, because the battery is tiny.  It's not a big deal to carry extras around with you though because again, they are tiny.<br /><br />Minor gripes:<br />- While the front ring can be customized somewhat, the rear ring is set depending on the camera mode.  It would be nice if that were reversible, so you could have the front ring set by camera mode and the rear ring customized.  I would have liked to customize the rear wheel to step zoom while in A mode.  You can however hit the Q.Menu button, and then use the rear wheel to step zoom.  The Q.Menu opens to the last menu item used, so if I change any other setting I just put it back to step zoom before I close Q.Menu (which can be done quickly with a half shutter push).<br />- The lens isn't super sharp.  Overall its fine, but I would gladly give up some of the focal reach in exchange for sharper glass.  The Canon s110 probably has the right idea with its 24-120 f2 lens, since zooming over 120mm should probably be done with your feet.<br />- The on/off button is just the stupidest design ever.  If it were a slide switch instead of a push button it would be fine where it is, but why would anyone put any push button right next to the shutter button?  I've gotten somewhat used to it, but I do occasionally miss a shot due to this ridiculous design flaw.<br />- Flash.  I have to hold the camera differently when using flash in order to not create a shadow.  I suppose they weren't able to put it on the EVF side of the lens, but this camera is so small they could have easily made the body slightly wider to improve ergonomics.<br /><br />My typical settings:<br />A or P mode with front ring set to step zoom if in P; 1-area AF (using the shutter button to half-press lock and reframe; Function button set to exposure lock; 3:2 Raw (I use Lightroom); (i)ISO; Center weighted metering; on screen level.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />My first ever digital camera had a 1/2.3 size CCD type sensor, so when I went to replace it I went overboard with an APS-C size sensor in a mirrorless camera.  Given that the LF1's 1/1.7 size MOS sensor is much closer to the sensor size of my first digital camera, it's amazing to see how much better it is.  On a scale between the two, the LF1 seems closer to the photo quality of an APS-C sensor than it does to a 1/2.3 CCD sensor, assuming you use RAW quality and spend the time in Adobe Lightroom creating good presets."

AELVXPXSJBXXQBU6LA6Q5SO327DA,B00CGYP3D2,5,1,True,"This proved to be an excellent CPU cooling option for my PC. Using an older mid-tower chassis with an Intel I7-377k (not overclocked), running a single exhaust fan in the back (92x92mm), 16GB RAM and a video card. The ambient temperature is about 32 °C, being in the tropics. With the stock Intel heat sink and fan, the temperature of the CPU was about 14 °C above ambient, in the range of 44 to 46 °C without any load. Using Skype or any VOIP applications will push the temperatures closer to 60 °C.<br /><br />After replacing the stock Intel cooler with the AR02 in May2014, the CPU temperature when idle is about 8 °C above ambient at 34 to 36 °C. At similar loads as above, the temperature rarely goes about 42 -44 °C, even with a single 92x92mm exhaust.<br /><br />Subsequently, added two intake fans (two Cougar Vortex 120mm) and replaced the rear fan with a Noctua 92mm to improve the air flow. Added a few Silverstone Tek 120mm Ultra fine fan filters to reduce the dust intake as well. I bought one from here, but the rest from ebay. But are even cheaper from the external store website of the ebay seller. Discovered it only after buying from ebay.<br /><br />Installation itself was easy, having upgraded the motherboard and processor about an year ago, the previous experience helped with the task. Had to remove the existing CPU air intake duct from the chassis. As mentioned in the other reviews here and elsewhere, the instructions need a magnifier to read. The video on the manufacturer's website helps a bit. The holes on the rear bracket not always match. Just match one or two holes and go with whatever hole that coordinates well while looking from the front of the motherboard. Keeping the chassis flat on its side is a must for installing this as with any CPU heat sinks. Positioned the heat sink so that the fan is blowing from front to the back and the air flow is vented by the rear fan. Both fans are almost in a straight line to facilitate this. The full assembly took about 30 minutes with all components ready and also using a magnifier to study the little diagrams on the instruction sheet.<br /><br />As mentioned in questions and answers, the heat sink projects 138mm from the motherboard surface. Still leaves about an inch inside my chassis. Did not have any issues with overhang over the RAM as I have two 8 GB modules with the other two slots empty.<br /><br />Did some research on positioning of the heat sink itself, especially of the heat pipes. My installation has the heat pipes in a sideways U configuration with the U lying on its left side. With sintered heat pipes (most of this type of heat sinks have sintered heat pipes), the positioning of the heat pipes, except for upside down, with the ends pointing down, does not matter.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Update on 13-April-2015:<br /><br />The PC is still going strong. Upgraded to a home grown wooden PC case, to improve the air flow, with better cable management and 3 120mm fans for intake and one 120mm fan for exhaust. The CPU temperature is 1 to 2 °C above ambient (tropical climate) without load. With load, spikes to 7 to 8 °C above ambient and comes down to aforementioned temperatures quickly."

No breakdowns, no freezes, no drivers resetting (like my last computer, the reason I got a new one)<br /><br />Lots of space: 8 GB of RAM so it has plenty of room to do everything I want at once, 1 TB of hard drive space. I'm not filling that up anytime soon! Especially since I use an external hard drive for pictures (safer that way).<br /><br />Windows 10: So easy to use. Windows 10 is a classic Microsoft operating system that is USER FRIENDLY and efficient. You can get anything done, connect to One Drive right within the File Explorer (you have to have a One Drive account to use online storage space), and it is all so clear, modern, and fast.<br /><br />I wanted fast: I got medium-fast. It isn't a super speedy computer but that kind of makes me believe it is good enough to be true :) Still does a job, I don't have to wait more than a second for say, a file to open. It take less than a minute to turn on and get to log in.<br /><br />I wanted external space: There are 3 USB drives - 2 on the left side and 1 on the right, there is room for an SD memory card (possibly also for macro/XD, haven't tried). I had no problem attaching an external hard drive, charging my Bluetooth speaker, and copying pictures from a memory card.<br />There is a jack, I assume for Ethernet, as well as some other things I don't use... but it is all available!<br /><br />I wanted updated self-installing drives: I inserted a Bluetooth mouse and an external hard drive and both were instantly usable. I did not have to wait for the computer to download drives, install programs, etc. That was a HUGE unexpected plus!<br /><br />I have not yet used the disc drive but I have all the reason to believe it will run smoothly and not corrupt the system.<br /><br />This laptop is sleek. It isn't a laptop but it's not heavy at all, easily carry-able. Another plus is that the charger is thin, wiry, with only a small adapter. No clunky wires you can't hold.<br /><br />The keyboard is great. It isn't a plastic piece stuck on - each button is separate, they are high enough to make you feel like you're touching something, they have a light feel. So easy to use and responsive.<br /><br />I must have left something out but my summary is clear: this computer is well worth the money. I'm glad I bought it.<br /><br />If I feel any differently in the future, I will update my review. In the meantime, this laptop gets 5 stars.<br /><br />If you feel my review was helpful, please let me know below. Feel free to ask any questions or comment!"

I also figured that the memory in this one was the same as what some of the other brand-name companies are using. I liked that it's assembled in the US. I read the reviews, here and elsewhere and di not find anything to be concerned about (actually, most of what I read was positive). So far so good.

When I bought my Synology RS815+ a few years ago, I followed their guidelines and upgraded the memory to the 6 GB DDR3 max in their guide. However, I learned two things:<br /><br />1) Open a terminal session to the NAS and run the following commands:<br /><br />sudo dmidecode -t memory<br /><br />sudo dmidecode -t processor<br /><br />2) Note the information from the commands and go to the ark.intel.com website.<br /><br />The two commands tell you about the processor's capabilities and the current memory modules' specifications. The information helped me with researching the processor at the Intel site, which told me it can do either DDR3 or DDR3L memory - 64 GB max to be exact.<br /><br />I removed the 2 DDR3 modules and replaced them wholly with the kit. I've been running this 16 GB DDR3L kit for a week now with little to no problem. (It seems like it's running a bit cooler, too, with the dual voltage capability.) I'm getting more value out of my NAS. I might run the risk of breaking whatever warranty I have, but I rather find more value than to throw away money. Good luck to anyone else with a RS815+ or other Synology NAS type that uses DDR3 memory. Try the instructions and see if they'll help you get more usability and value out of your NAS. This kit will definitely get you started."

AHR3FPHGSSBTHLTPOJ6HIKRSE63Q,B002DPUUL4,5,0,True,"I have always thought the Microsoft 5-button Optical Intellimouse was my favorite mouse...but they don't make that anymore.  I was concerned prior to getting this that I would feel that it is too small for my hands and what I am used to, but after having used it for about 3 weeks it is going great.  The size is just fine for me, the mouse tracks like I expect it to, I love the back button on the thumb.  I also like the NANO receiver so there is nothing to complain about on this mouse.  I'm planning on ordering another one for work just to have one there as well.<br /><br />Update May 2015:  I have had the first mouse for about 18 months now with no issues, still love it.  I did buy a 2nd one for work and had no issues with that one.  I'd estimate my battery life at 6-10 months depending on usage.  I think I've replaced my original mouse battery twice and my work one once so far.  I do notice that sometimes it indicate that the battery needs replaced but if you just keep using it then it will go away so I don't know how accurate the charge sensor is.  For the cost of a single AA battery though if it is important to you that you can't have your mouse battery die in the middle of using it then just replace it anytime it indicates it.  If you are like most people and it is only a slight inconvenience to pause what you are doing to swap a battery then just wait until it stops working and you'll likely get a few more months of use out of each battery.  I do turn my mouse off when not using it though so that probably helps my battery life."

AF5C2VN2T3YFMG37IF6UNYL32GCA,B07485VYDC,2,2,True,"This Review is long, but it's longer for some good reasons...<br /><br />With these aftermarket chargers, yea they're usually a lot less expensive but there is a down side.<br />Dell Laptop Mainboards have been engineered to use OEM Parts, the Charger is one of those parts. However you can use practically any Brand SSD or Memory to Upgrade your Laptop....<br /><br />A lot of the times, (depending on witch model Dell Laptop I'm using), I will get one of the following messages/error message....<br />During Boot-up, I get an ''Error Message'' letting me know that the power source isn't recognized, so certain functions cannot be used. (Tht is not an exact quote but you get the idea.<br />When needing to run the ''Self-Diagnostics Test'' Program, unless the Charger is an OEM, you can get stuck in what is called ''A Diagnostic-Test-Loop'', meaning, you usually can't get into the OS, and may require you to continually Hold-Down the Power Button in order to Force your Laptop to Power-Down. But here's the whole problem with that usually happens....<br /><br />Also known as a ''Hard Reset'', These Hard Resets are used/needed when running certain functionality tests, when Boot-Up Issues are present, (Will Not Boot-Up-Into-Windows.), and the laptop requires you to ''De-Energize the Mainboard, inside your laptop, by 1: Unplugging the Charger. 2: Removing the Battery, where depending on the model, This would mean completely disassembling the laptop. & then<br />3: Holding down the Power Button for up to 1 minute, to de-energize all of the Capacitors on the Mainboard. Then you assemble the Laptop... This totally sucks....<br />Hard Resets are not for when you get up in the morning, grab a cup of coffee, then sitting down & powering on your laptop & then end up spending up to 10 or 15 minutes yelling at it, because it worked just fine last night....<br /><br />I have a total of 5 Dell laptops. The 1st 2 are *Inspiron 15R-5520, (Released back in 2012-13).<br /><br />(Please Read The ''Notes'' Section at the bottom of my Review for Laptop Information).....<br /><br />For the 15R-5520's, After I installed the latest BIOS Update from the Dell Website, The Maximum Memory for the laptops increased from 8GB, to a total of 16GB. (That's Called A Great Engineering Idea from Dell, & the memory thing isn't engineered into every Model made by them., it could have been an engineering oops moment...)<br /><br />The other 2 Dells I use/have, are the Inspiron 2-in-1 Tablet-Laptop Model 13-7378.<br />Although I've been really use to using laptops with a 15.6'' size Screen, it wasn't hard to make the adjustment down to the smaller 13.3'' Screen, as I imagined it would be. Plus, it's so nice to fold & sit it on my lap & watch a movie or 2, or with the keyboard showing, i still browse the web, do research & make documents.<br /><br />Storage: I replaced the smaller 256GB SSDs that came from the Factory. One of the 13-7378 laptops now has a 500Gb SSD, (Actually an *M.2 SATA Drive), while the 2nd one has a larger 1-TB M.2 SATA Drive, it has plenty of storage. (See, I do a lot of research, which requires me to have at least 1, (one) Laptop with more storage...<br /><br />My 5th & Final Dell, is the Inspiron 3000 Series Laptop, Model 3583. (Released back in 2018 thru 2020 Although this model is part of Dell's Budget line, Dell engineered the Mainboard with 2 Storage Ports/Slots. One Port takes the older 2.5'' SATA SSD. However Dell also added a port/slot for a M.2 P-CLe - NVMe SSD, (The NVMe's are the fastest of the M'2 Storage Drives)... Strange, the Budget Model comes with a Faster Storage Drive, while their Better Laptop comes with a Slower Drive....<br /><br />Here is the information that you might want to think about, starting with the oldest laptops first...<br /><br />Note 1: Dell Inspiron 15R-5520 Laptops. They are among the last Laptop Lines Made By Dell that will allow you to run the Windows 7, or older OS. Although Windows 10/10 Pro can run on these laptops, I still like Windows 7 because there's a lot of software programs made for that OS, that I use. So it might not get used a whole lot but it does have an up-gradable CPU, as I said earlier, they hold 16GB of Memory. Plus you can remove the Optical Drive & through an adapter, you can add a 2nd Storage SSD, instead of having to carry around an external Storage Drive.... (The parts are so much older, making any repairs can be done cheap...<br /><br />Note: When Intel came out with the 7th Generation of their i-3, i-5 & i-7 CPU's they no longer worked with Window's 7, or the newer OS... So in other words, You have to use Windows 10....<br /><br />Note 2: Inspiron 2-in-1 Tablet/Laptop, Model 13-7378. Here's how Microsoft & Laptop Manufacturers joined together, in order to force End-Users into the Newer-Zero Privacy OS. (ie. Windows 10/10 Pro, followed by the newer, OS 11 & so on.) By making the Newer CPU's/ aka Processors differently, they will no longer work with older versions of Windows OS, ie 7/Basic,7 Home, /7 Pro, /7 Ultimate...<br />I totally dislike knowing that Microsoft engineered a lot of extra Back-Doors into the OS, for their ''So Called'' 3rd Party Vendors to pop-in to monitor an issue, correct an issue. Because of this, we're still not fully aware of the entire list of their 3rd Party Vendors & I hate to say it but you'd probably want to start using Smoke Signals in order to communicate with people, instead of emailing, or chatting using your favorite Social Media. So Yes, to me, the more privacy I have, the better. It's not like I'm doing anything illegal, it's just the fact ya know, practically anyone can see what we do online, or even offline when the wifi card is in the ''On-Position.''<br /><br />Again, I apologize for making this Review so long, but when I get into a subject, I always seem to lean towards explaining every single detail that I'm aware of about the item, or all the items associated with it...<br /><br />Note 3: These newer Laptops, Inspiron 2-in-1 13-7378, or the Inspiron 3000 - 3583 and the Batteries. When you start receiving messages on these Laptops, letting you know that the System Battery is starting to wear out, Do yourself a favor. These newer laptops are designed with Batteries on the inside of the Case, perhaps 1 out of every 20 Laptop Models are still Old-School, with External Batteries..<br /><br />Here's the biggest issues caused by allowing your Batty to wear completely out before replacing it.<br />Here's what happened to me. I let the Battery in one of my 13-7383 2-in-1 laptops to get completely worn out. Now even though the laptop would Boot-Up & I could still work in the Windows OS, I began getting ''Random'' Restarts, when I was still working on something. Sometimes I would get stuck in one of those Self-Diagnostic-Tests, where it could take up to a half hour to correct. Sometimes the Battery just kept charging, which can damage your Mainboard because once it over-swells & plastic that conceals the Battery pops open, the leakage can ruin your Mainboard.<br />So do yourself a favor. When you first notice that it's taking a longer time to re-charge the Battery, or you start receiving any Battery-Error Messages, order a replacement Battery & install it. Now if you decide to use an Aftermarket Battery, 1: they will not last as long as the OEM Battery, but with most folks, spending $80+ for the Battery is considered insane.... So if you don't mind the extra bucks, go OEM.<br /><br />Now this Review was originally for Dell Chargers. I've had more problems than it's worth from buying Aftermarket Chargers. In fact, the one I bought here for this Review, was the very last one I'll be getting. Luckily I still have extra/older OEM Dell Chargers around the house to use. Now the Cord-Adapters I'll buy from Aftermarket companies. Those are used to either increase, or decrease the size of the plug on the Laptop...<br /><br />I know the review was really long but I wanted to talk about other issues that you may encounter....<br />I certainly hope I was able to help at least some of you reading this Review.... Thank You & Take Care, Dan"
AF5C2VN2T3YFMG37IF6UNYL32GCA,B0037YRNXS,5,10,False,"I've been in the computer business for just about 10 years. When it comes to buying products that I sell, be it Desktops or Notebooks you can trust MSI. Why I trust them is because MSI is a leader in Motherboard Technology. In fact most of the Computer Systems out there have an MSI Motherboard inside. Just because it has another name brand stamped on the board, it might be an MSI. The MSI A5000 has been one of the most sought after models I've seen in the last 2 years & I've sold a lot of Notebooks over that time period.<br />Don't be fooled about the Celeron Processor. When I got the first shipment of the A5000's I did some research because the last thing I want to do is sell a system that lags. I usually open up one & use it to see what it can do. Customer satisfaction is very important to us & lets face it, you don't want to spend your hard earned money on something thats going to slow you down. Intel has done a wonderful job with this Dual Core Processor. The design does stand the test of time. I couldn't get enough of these models, they sold just as fast as I could order them & I was very surprised when I got a call from one of our suppliers letting me know that they just got another shipment in. About 99% of the time, once the sales end, the manufacture comes out with the next model, that was not the case here. Unlike HP [for example] who might have 50 different models under [lets say a DV6000], MSI has 1 so there is no confusion on the spec's, you don't have to worry when your looking for a download or any updates from the manufacture website. If it's for a A5000 then it's for that model. That's another reason I like MSI. In fact 95% of the systems we use are MSI, in both Intel & AMD Platforms. I highly doubt that we will change. When we have good luck with a system we try & stay with that manufacture for all our upgrade needs. This is the case with MSI<br />When I started to write this review, I didn't expect it to be this long, but we were so impressed with the A5000, I felt obligated to talk a bit about it, in fact I rarely do reviews but since no one took the time to do a review I felt that I should.<br />The MSI systems we use have been great. As a Reseller, we had a meeting & decided to stop selling the other brands that we normally carry & started concentrating on selling the brands that we got the most positive feedback on. MSI has been the very best. The MSI brand has been so great, most of our returning client's ask if they can get something made by MSI.<br />With LED becoming the new standard with Notebook display's you can't beat the price on the A5000. Not only is LED a power saver [which is important for Notebook user's on the go], it is the next generation in Notebook Display. Not only does it give brighter picture, LED Back light Technology gives beautiful, clear & crisp viewing. The HDMI ensures quality you can get for both your Audio & Video. The HDMI output sends this remarkable viewing to your Projected or TV. Last, MSI's ECO Engine delivers to you the best in Smart Technology, if it's Document, Presentation, or for Entertainment, MSI is leader in today's Digital World.<br />Thanks for taking the time to read my review & I hope that I was able to help."
AHJPP2OS7XJM4U3A7XHZNVJPED6A,B004XC6GJ0,2,0,True,"The SURFboard SB2161 was a great cable modem in its day, but is now showing its age. In practice, it probably won't get you speeds over about 140Mb down. But even if your internet package is only 50Mb or 100Mb, this is still not a great choice because it supports only 4 download channels. Having more channels means access to potentially clearer channels when the 4 you are using get &#34;clogged up&#34; by neighborhood usage. If you're looking for a cable modem today, I'd suggest checking out the Netgear CM600, which gives you 24 download channels and supports much faster speeds. Or for a little more money, you could get the Motorola MB8600, which is more expensive, but also more future proof and might actually save you money in the long term. Stay away from the SURFboard SB6190 and any other modem that uses the problematic Intel PUMA chipset. The SURFboard SB8200 is a safe bet, as it uses the Broadcom chipset, like CM600 and the MB8600."
AG7DNCSHW62A2IOR3DVPHAJZSCHA,B001U3ZUWO,5,20,True,"I struggled over a 4 or 5 star rating for this product but ultimately believe that Sony has delivered an excellent package in the HX1. The other cameras I considered prior to purchasing the HX1 were several DSLRs, which I ruled out due to lack of support for video and the Canon SX1. The tipping points for me on the Sony were the panorama, twilight steady shot and high speed burst modes.<br /><br />The image quality is absolutely excellent and there are more than enough program modes to help you get the ideal image for your shooting conditions. The intelligent mode selection works surprisingly well  and is our defacto setting for the camera. I must say that while the panorama setting initially felt like gimmick, it is REALLY cool and works very well. I now look for opportunities to shoot panoramas! There a many more than you think - this feature will change your perspective on shooting images.<br /><br />The video is high quality, though I've been wrapped up in the still image shots since getting the camera a few days ago so I can't comment fully on this yet.<br /><br />There are only two significant issues that keep this from being the perfect camera for me. The first is the damn Memory Stick format. What the heck is Sony thinking with this? I realize that corporate greed and ego drive Sony to create  their own standards for every thing but this has nearly prevented me from purchasing this excellent product. I have purchased a 4 GB MS Duo Pro and a 8 GB Micro SD with a MS Duo adapter. I have not used the Micro SD with the adapter yet but I'm concerned about speed. We shall see.<br /><br />The other frustration for me is the speed of writing the 10 shots taken in burst mode to the memory card. It takes 10-15 seconds to write the 10 shots to the card.

But isn’t that the point?  Compared to the puny “heat-sink” combo which comes with most of our CPUs (image attached), this thing is like a four-story building. It’s not even close.  So, unless you are literally running Prime95 24 hours a day, then you probably don't ACTUALLY need the Dark Rock Pro just in order for your computer to function properly.  But on the flipside, I literally never have to worry about my temperatures going critical again, and make no mistake: I was already flirting with 80-90 temperatures (even without overclocking) based on intensive CPU load with my prior setup. And theoretically, wouldn't we want our PC running at full potential even in the event of a worst-case-scenario anyway? I certainly would. So I'm glad I decided to splurge a little bit.  This heatsink is... well, it's an experience.  It looks like an engine block everytime I open my PC.  And I love it!<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br /><br />First on the list, I have to say that this thing actually made my CPU run faster.  No joke.  To put it in more thermodynamically-correct terms, this unit removed the barrier to performance that my CPU's heat was creating for itself.  Leads me to believe the included heat-sink/fan combos that usually come with these CPUs actually reduce their performance, and are in a way short-changing the customer.  That's how much of a difference this made.  I know people talk about wanting good temps, but I had no idea how much of a correlation there actually was between heat and performance (even just beyond the 70° range).<br /><br />OVERCLOCKING<br /><br />So a few days after recording the silly video attached to this review, I finally got around to overclocking up to 4.0 gHz (which is 1.5 gHz above my CPU's rated frequency).  Temperatures STILL did not crack much above 66° (66.3° to be exact), even with Prime95's most strenuous test running, and with FurMark executing GPU stress testing as well!  (Oh, and I had Santana playing just for good measure too.)  I can tell you for certain that I was not expecting that.  60° or so used to be the temperature where my CPU started, once I'd gotten my editing or gaming programs going - and that was with stock clock speeds!  As you can imagine, my previous temps would only go up from there.<br /><br />INSTALLATION<br /><br />If you have an NVMe drive tucked back there on your motherboard, don’t ever think about trying to remove it again without having to first uninstall this fan.  On the flipside, if you haven’t yet taken advantage of your NVMe M.2 port, I would suggest doing so before this installation.  This thing is a monster, and once it’s installed you’re probably going to want to keep it that way.  I did this by myself on a basic drawing table, and I was very happy that the nifty screwdriver which came included (not pictured) had a magnetized tip.  The only inconvenience I encountered was that one of the top thumbscrews, which you have to unscrew in order to stick this long screwdriver through in order to reach the brackets underneath, required me to loosen it with needle-nosed pliers – because it wouldn’t turn past a certain point just using my thumb.  I made sure to pad them with paper towel fragments before they made contact with the thumbscrew so as not to damage its finish.  And I HIGHLY recommending ordering a pair of these miniature magnetic flashlights to assist you in your installation:<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FFKJVT1<br /><br />OPTIONS AND MISC<br /><br />I opted to connect the main CPU FAN cable to the splitter before mounting the unit, and then left the unused end of the splitter out so that I could attach it after the main component was secured to the backplate.  I then opted for the secondary fan cable to be routed via the bottom, which actually made it easier to connect, rather than fiddling with that cloistered top motherboard shelf area after the fact.<br /><br />Be aware – the little wire ‘hooks’ that you use to wrap around the heatsink and secure that middle fan? There are two different sizes. I didn’t realize this at first. The smaller ones worked better for me.  (And yes, being an attached-motherboard build, it was a little difficult to secure the top one after it was already in the case, but I could do and therefore so can you :-)  The only downside to this approach is – for an attached motherboard installation, anyway - there seems to be no way to know whether the middle fan is spinning after it’s connected!  It’s that quiet.  But my temps aren't reading anything to indicate it's NOT spinning, so I guess I'll just have to trust the system.  And just to confirm, I had to add the middle fan after everything else was already secured to my system, which required me to take out my graphics card beforehand.  Try not to almost forget to put it back in when you’re done, like I did, and keep it in a safe place while it’s away, lol.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />The Dark Rock Pro 4 is very quiet. In fact, it jarred me when I first booted the PC after the fact, because it didn't sound like it came on!  At the time of installation, only the front intake fan of my case was really making noticeable noises as its lifespan was winding down – so shortly after installation, I just removed it entirely, with no detrimental impact on my temps.  As a matter of fact, I ended up removing the rear 120mm exhaust fan as well, because IT now became the noisy one!  And I replaced the top two 120mm exhaust fans with these 140mm ones, from Noctua, which are very quiet as well: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00KF7O58G<br /><br />I have not even bothered to replace the rear 120mm exhaust fan which I removed, because I really don’t need to.  That’s how good of a combo the aforementioned exhaust fans make with this unit.  Besides, “heat rises,” right?  And my temps have literally stayed the same throughout...<br /><br />As for spacing and fitting into your own ATX sized case, it might have helped that my case door somewhat “bulges” out to accommodate the exhaust fan which used to push air through those vents you’ll (see it in the video).  If you don’t have anything like that, I would run some tests during installation before you commit permanently.  If you have any padding on the inside of the door of your case, or if it’s somewhat smaller than standard, then it might not fit.  But I'll be honest - even if I didn't have that little extra aforementioned space, I would probably have modified the case door in order to make this fit – up to and including cutting a hole.  I think it's that beneficial.<br /><br />Lastly, I will say that for newcomers, it would be great to have some instruction in the manual for how to remove the previous thermal grease (since, you know, this is an obvious upgrade, and most people aren’t going to have this shipped on their system or even included in a starter system-build). We want to bring more people into PC building, and these little niceties would make the barrier to entry a little lower.  I also think it would benefit ""BeQuiet!"" to develop a reputation of really supporting newcomers.<br /><br />That being said, the existing instructions were easy enough to follow, and for AMD the assembly seems much simpler than for Intel. The sub-box which contained the instructions, the thermal paste, the mounts, etc. did come with like 7 different instruction booklets. I had to open each one to see which language applied to me.  It would be great if “be quiet!” would print the enclosed language on the OUTSIDE of each of these instruction booklets, so we knew which one to pick right away.  But I will give it to them – they did everything else right with this model.  Thank you, BQ!  I’m sure this heatsink will be with me for many years to come."

AHAZ7VM6YQU5CO2IBFX2GOZX7XYA,B01LD4ML30,5,6,True,"This review is for the following version/specs since there are multiple options:<br />Acer Aspire S 13 Touch<br />Model: S5-371T-78TA<br />13.3&quot; Full HD<br />Intel Core i7<br />8GB LPDDR3<br />256GB SSD<br />Fingerprint Reader<br />Windows 10<br /><br />Bias disclosure: I work in technology, I am already a big fan of Acer brand laptops (my prior model was an Aspire V7), and I've only had this new Aspire for a week.<br /><br />Feather light and convenient: I'm a small person and the Aspire S 13 comfortably fits in the crook of my arm. Some of you larger people might find this a weird concern but for the wee folk, we have a short forearm to work with so it's important that the laptop size and weight are carefully balanced. Acer hit the mark with this one in that regard.<br /><br />Caveat: I do not recommend this laptop for the accident-prone or those who are not gentle on electronics (see bulk of unhappy reviews). The reason the Aspire S 13 is so light is that it doesn't come stocked with a bulky, heavy case. This thing is thin which makes it wonderfully light but if you routinely drop devices, go find something sturdier...with a rollcage.<br /><br />As for convenience, for the first time in forever, I have a laptop that I can use on my lap. The vents are along the bottom up next to the hinge which means I no longer have to worry about a laptop overheating from a lack of airflow, regardless of how I sit.<br /><br />Performance: the Aspire S 13 is snappy fast (again, strictly speaking of the model S5-371T-78TA). Why is it so quick? First off, no &quot;bloatware.&quot; I cannot thank Acer enough for having the good sense to keep their setup simple. I've had to deal with Dell, HP, Toshiba, and a few other name brands where straight out of the box, the laptop is bogged down by an excessive number of branded software that's set to startup with Windows. On this particular model, Acer has one piece of software that has no impact on the performance at all, and it sits quietly out of sight, waiting for you rather than popping up in your face every five minutes with prompts to &quot;click here! Buy this!&quot;<br /><br />The second reason is the hardware specs that are already listed above. The recent Windows 10 update has also improved performance significantly with a couple of low-end machines I work with so I imagine it's an added bonus with this laptop. The key thing about all this is that even with these specs, the laptop stays super quiet and doesn't get hot. I've run video editing software (Premiere), streamed videos, and played games such as Portal Knights without so much as a peep out of the laptop. At one point the fans were audible but that was during a stress test and even then, it was nothing like the obnoxious whirring that comes with most laptops.<br /><br />The touchpad is nice and responsive--I normally would use a mouse on laptops but this one is well-made--and the fingerprint reader is handy and reliable.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this product and recommend it to people looking for a light-weight and great performing laptop."

There always seems to be 10-15% of reviewers giving 1 star for DOA's or dead memory slots and I always wonder if these things are due to user error or not.<br /><br />It seems appropriate to give 5 stars for the opposite experience: a board that works on the first power up and survives a 48hr burn-in period. This is one of those boards. I have not tested with a PCIe video card since the on-chip Intel HD610 graphics drive my 3 monitors at 1080p and rather quickly. I chose this board because it has the 3 video outputs: VGA, DVI-d and HDMI and I need 3. I have not tested the M.2 slots or optane. EDIT: I now have installed a 275gb M.2 drive from Crucial and it works no problem, not sure it's any faster than the Samsung SSD but it runs about 10 degrees F cooler given it's close proximity to the CPU fan. here is the link for the M.2:<br /><br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01IAGSDJ0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br /><br />I'm not a gamer, so my board is sparse.

The cap over the the CPU socket protecting the pins was in place when I opened the box and I can assure you there's no way that cap could ever come loose or fall off during shipping, just not possible. I always run with the case open so I did not test/use the I/O shield.<br /><br />I have tested the USB 2 and 3 ports (not the USB-C), the sound, and 2 of the sata ports, all is well so far and the pulsing red on the board does not bother me, it's somewhat comforting in that it shows a working board, although be aware it continues as long as the power supply is on, whether the machine is in sleep mode or shut down, this can be changed in the BIOS setup.<br /><br />memory that I can verify works on this board is here:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01BIWLFGQ/ref=od_aui_detailpages00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br />I have 2 of those installed and no problem.<br /><br />The g4560 processor that I can verify works with it is here:<br />https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NCE8T92/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1<br /><br />It is a dual core but hardware monitors and Win10 device manager will show 4, due to the threading.<br /><br />The BIOS setup is very easy to use although I don't need too much of it since I gave up overclocking anything years ago.<br />I've had good experiences with Asus boards as well as Gigabyte, BioStar and MSI.<br /><br />The board runs cool as does the processor, maybe 10-15deg F above ambient.<br /><br />Edit: added a picture of the HDMI port since someone said it doesn't have one, yes. it. does."

Ran some benchmarks, got 33226 in Antutu, and 17,899 in Quadrant.  Thats just about equal to the Snapdragon 800 processor benchmarks(in the Kindle Fire HDX, among other devices, one of the most powerful android devices around).<br />The screen is a little dark, but I always turn down brightness to save battery on all my mobile devices, so it's fine for me.

GPS works well, locks in satellites quickly.<br />Battery life is of course dependant on usage.  Play some heavy graphic games, and you'll get probably 5 hours tops.

The value is therefor a toss-up in favor of all the things it DOES have.<br /><br />OVERALL - 3.5/10 - If you are looking for something relatively inexpensive that you can bring around with you easily and not worry about it taking up too much space, this is a great laptop to consider. Dell does have the upper hand with the m1330, but if you are a little more price-concious, this laptop will be for you."

Usually, however, the small size implies a very wireless computing experience, but the terrible battery life of the device, kept me very plugged in. I'll break down the computer for you:<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-Great screen - with a native resolution of 1280x800, image quality is crisp on the 12.1"" screen. I did experience some glare, but not too much to hinder the experience.<br /><br />-Plenty of RAM - 2GB is great, especially on a Vista machine<br /><br />-160GB HD - Awesome for a laptop this size<br /><br />-nVidia Graphics - It's great not to have your RAM sucked up by Integrated Graphics<br /><br />-Built-in Web Cam<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-Quite thick - I was surprised, the picture makes it look much thinner than it is<br /><br />-Battery life - Abysmal. About 125 minutes on the drain test. A little higher on average testing, about 141 minutes. With Sony running a 6-7 hour machine, and Apple with a 4 hour machine... HP is left in the dust.<br /><br />-Lousy App Performance - With 2 GB of RAM, and a PCI-Express Graphics card, you'd expect more out of it, but because of the slow AMD chip, it doesn't compare to the much faster Intel Core 2 Duos, and with the Santa Rosa chips (labeled under the Pro name), this computer feels outdated<br /><br />-Touch screen isn't incredibly intuitive - but it will work for what you're paying<br /><br />-No 802.11n<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: As a spec mongol, it excells, as a portable laptop, it's average, as a tablet, it's mediocre, but as an entertainment device, it feels very below par from what it appears to be."
AHOG6TOFS2NDQW2EO3WTCZIGWI5Q,B000IXBBZM,4,53,False,"This is an outstanding computer. I was very impressed with Toshiba. This is probably the first non-Qosmio Toshiba laptop that I actually enjoyed testing. There are some things that overshadow this computer, but continue to read anyways to see if these concerns pertain to you.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />Processor - FAST, Intel Core 2 Duo (new line) at 2GHz. This is the first Core 2 Duo laptop that I've had a chance to toy around with, and I was VERY impressed. It's not a REMARKABLE upgrade from the Core Duo 2.0GHz, but it is very noticible, espeically in gaming.<br /><br />Graphics - Powerful nVidia 7900GS. Great for playing all the current games, and is Vista compatible for the January launch. Half-Life 2, Doom 3, F.E.A.R., and Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion all played excellent. World of Warcraft also ran without a hitch, even on a wireless connection.<br /><br />RAM-  2GB! Not 1GB, 2! This is all the computing power you'll need. Excellent. Not only that, there is still room to expanand, accepting up to 4GB (which is ridiculous, I don't recommend it unless you are a graphics whore)<br /><br />Hard Drive - 200GB! MASSIVE. Keep in mind, this is a single hard drive, not RAID 0 linked 2 ATA drives, this is 1!<br /><br />DVD Burner- Standard, but always nice<br /><br />GREAT CONNECTIONS - Bluetooth, Firewire Port, USB, Express Port, Card Reader... just about everything seems to be here, including a fast 802.11 connection<br /><br />Quiet - also under cons, see below<br /><br />Lighweight - about a pound lighter than the Dell XPS; only 7.8lbs<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Battery Life - Like most 17"" laptops, the battery life is atrocious. I got about 88 minutes in my battery drain test, 119 minutes under normal conditions, and 130 minutes under my power saving settings<br /><br />Quiet - Although quiet, it's because the hard drive speed is running at 4200RPM to improve battery life and noise regulation. If you don't know, 4200RPM is slow, most laptop hard drives run between 5400-7200RPM.<br /><br />Heat - Warms up pretty warm, but not like a Mac, so no exploding batteries in this.<br /><br />Track pad - very small and awkwardly places for someone who's left-handed like myself<br /><br />Screen - very bright, but the resolution could be better<br /><br />Nothing next gen- No HD-DVD drive, no Blu Ray drive, no next gen ATi or nVidia card... everything is just top of the line for this generation<br /><br />Slow recharge time- 4 hours to fully recharge a battery is pretty lame. Similar laptops are between 90-150 minutes.<br /><br />Speakers - very disappointing for Harmon Kardon speakers<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Great desktop replacement, but for on the go, keep the trips limited.

I feel that this is all around a very great deal.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />- Intel Core Duo T2400 - 1.83GHz isn't the fastest, but a sweet spot when it comes to performance and price<br /><br />- Massive 120GB HD - Very great brand hard drive, and pretty quiet<br /><br />- Beautiful 13.3"" TFT - I love Sony's screens<br /><br />- Hybrid Graphics Card - Okay, there is a VERY amazing feature on this laptop.  There is a switch allowing for either SPEED or STAMINA.  STAMINA has the computer running an Integrated Media Accelerator.  This is good for websurfing, listening to music, or casual everyday things.  And then there's SPEED mode, which is taking advantage of the PCI-Ex16 nVidia 7400 128MB card also on board.  This allows for medium-high game level settings, photo editing, fast DVD encoding, etc.  This feature bring me to the next amazing part of this laptop:<br /><br />- BATTERY LIFE - THIS IS WHAT I CALL A MARATHON RUNNER.  The battery life from this laptop on Stamina mode was over 5 hours long! I was listening to music the whole time, blogging, streaming videos, doing e-mails, spreadsheets, and installed a few programs.  What a machine.  I haven't tested SPEED mode on its full capacity, but just the fact that it has that option is amazing.  Manufacturer claims 7 hours I think, but I had Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on.<br /><br />- Integrated 1.3 MegaPixel Webcam - very clear<br /><br />- Full Sized Keyboard - Great sized keys for such a small laptop<br /><br />- VERY LIGHT WEIGHT - Under 4 lbs, a breeze!<br /><br />- Biometric Fingerprint Scanning - Great for the extra security<br /><br />- Windows XP Professional - excellent<br /><br />- DVD+R DL/DVD+/-RW Combo CD-RW Combo Drive... great<br /><br />- Card Reader - Although limited, still great<br /><br />- Carbon Fiber Casing - Very sturdy<br /><br />- Excellent ports and connections for size<br /><br />- Stays cool - Quiet fan when it heats up, doesn't ever get too hot that it become uncomfortable<br /><br />- Bluetooth/Wi-Fi<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />- Expensive - Perfection comes at a price<br /><br />- Not as thin as expected - Kind of a thick case for the screen size, not as thin as the MacBook<br /><br />I almost advise going to SonyStyle.com just so you can configure the 2.0GHz processor, but other than that, if they price is irking you, Sony has an outlet store online, and they offer this and many other laptops with 1 year waranties if it's refurbished.  I know a couple people that did that, and they shipped fast and had the right order.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: This laptop is near perfect.  Although not the most powerful, definately the best in it's class.  Performance meets functionality and portability in this FANASTIC notebook."

Obviously to get the best performance you would be better off with a 16x PCI-E slot.<br /><br />As far as wither its worth buying or not, I would say wait until newer cards drop back to normal prices instead as you would get much better performance from a card with at least 8GBs of dedicated memory then you will most 4GB cards. I myself am waiting for prices to drop back to near normal to get a better one myself. If you don't not mind the lower settings then go for it but $300 used it a joke for this card sorry. I wouldn't say its worth more then maybe $120 tops used or otherwise because its an older card & its not going to give you the best experience unless you just like running at low settings."

AFESUU27YXSKT2CH6ED66YVGSROQ,B09RN27LHT,3,16,True,"When I was shopping for the ultimate laptop to replace my desktop for good, I *only* looked at laptops with a Thunderbolt 4 interface.  I mean, why cheap out on *the* main interface to your high-speed peripherals?<br /><br />I loaded Intel's Thunderbolt utility (it's *their* standard and *everything* that advertises to be TB4, including hubs, cables, and peripherals *must* be verified through them!).  The utility, however, found *no* Thunderbolt controller!  Folks, this is just USB 4 10GB/s.  Sure, the speed is the same, but USB 4 does *not* have the same rigorous testing standards (or *any* certified testing!) that TB4 requires.  In addition, key features like DMA protection/authorization for TB devices is *completely* missing!<br /><br />How can ASUS (one of my favorite brands) get away with this?!?!  I feel duped!"
AFESUU27YXSKT2CH6ED66YVGSROQ,B0B2KXR67J,5,4,True,"I usually do very thorough reviews, but I don't have enough time to describe everything terrific about this device.  Qty:4 Thunderbolt 4 40 Gb/2 ports?  Uh, yes, pls!  Qty:4 USB 3.2 Gen 2 10 Gb/s ports?  Uh, yep, I'll take those, too!  Rugged design?  Check.  Beefy power supply?  Check.  Absolutely love, love, love having a 40 Gb/s backbone for all of my devices.  This is why most USB hub providers only list the speeds of their *downstream* ports and *rarely* the interface to the computer (which is wildly important, don't you think?).<br /><br />You *will not* find a faster, better made, higher-performance overall performance hub at anywhere near this pricepoint.  5 stars.  Stop reading!  Go buy!  Now!  :)<br /><br />P.S.  Stop buying anything with 5 Gb/s USB ports and look for USB-C *form factor* ports everywhere ('cause, you know, people think USB-C = Thunderbolt and other crazy stuff like that).  You definitely want to read up on how Thunderbolt 4 is an Intel standard, it brings actual *certifications* of computers, devices, and even cables!  You get that with *nothing* else!  And the speeds?  It takes USB 4.0 to hit 40 Gb/s and it *still* doesn't offer the same capabilities as Thunderbolt (eg. DMA protection/authorization).

AGOJYZGHZF4RMETDUUSGCR4BIWJQ,B008GVOVK0,3,0,True,"Update: Upon re-ordering from another vendor on this page, I received a non-Fosmon product which is incompatible with XBOne. So I have had to lower my stars from 5 to 3 as its now a Buyer Beware item. My more recent purchase shipped from China and I received a no-name knockoff (3 units actually). After testing all 3 with the Xbox One, I switched to a previously purchased Fosmon BRANDED switcher which did work flawlessly. I then purchased another Fosmon branded switch locally which also works. I am currently working with the vendor and possibly Amazon, if necessary, to resolve this issue. But BUYER BEWARE...if you don't get a genuine Fosmon product, you may be in store for problems. I am not sure if even mentioning the Chines shipper here would make a difference, they will just change their storefront name if they get a bad rep.<br />Below is my original review for the ACTUAL Fosmon branded switcher...not to be confused with the cheap knockoffs.<br />---Simple no-hassle quality product, the way it should be---<br />The Fosmon seems to be a pretty intelligent hdmi switcher. It does a good job of auto switching and also allows manual override in a nice compact package. It does its job without requiring any external power supply. This is a big plus since other products that do not ship with what is called an &#34;optional&#34; power supply, simply don't work without the &#34;optional&#34; power and associated waiting period to get it once you realize you have to have it. So the Fosmon product easily gets 5 stars for being complete and doing what it is expected to do seamlessly.<br />  One clue is that, if you are buying an hdmi switch that has a remote control...its more complex than it needs to be. The Fosman is the real deal."
AGOJYZGHZF4RMETDUUSGCR4BIWJQ,B004G8QZQK,3,171,False,"This unit is very much like the NB305 series with the card reader location exchanged with the audio inputs, by moving the reader to the front (beneath the touchpad) and vice versa. Some people may be interested to know...the SD card reader holds the card kind of flush with the front edge of the computer, but does not use the type of mechanism that I am used to. Some types push the SD card into a spring and lock. This one, just pushes into place with no lock and no click. You have to sort of pry the card out when you want it out, but if you leave a card docked there, like I do, its not a problem and it doesn't dangerously stick out the side of the machine when you are putting it into a case. Plus they save the cost and complexity of a spring.<br />  I'd give the display and keyboard a 5. Battery and weight is a 5, but due to the design issues with the mousepad and the poor audio, it gets a 3 overall.<br />  It's hard to consider dinging it for only 1GB RAM, when that seems standard. I wish they would just raise the price of netbooks $10, throw the 2GB in there and stop messing around. Like everyone else, I upgraded RAM immediately and had to trash an otherwise good RAM board.<br />  Although I shouldn't compare the 2 models. The NB305-310 is a joy, the NB505, not as much. NB505 Sound is wimpy, a single tiny speaker on the BOTTOM of the unit, essentially requiring even the cheapest set of external speakers for acceptable (and audible) sound. That's one of the big downfalls with the new slew of Netbooks in general. Is stereo worth the extra $30, U decide.<br />  Also this unit uses the N455 processor instead of N450, shades of gray regarding performance, as far as I can tell (I have both systems). Also battery life has dropped from 11 hours (NB305) to 9.5 hrs (NB505), according to their specs. I am not sure if this is a different 6 cell battery, a function of the Atom 455, or Win 7. I suppose people were complaining about the battery life being too long. It's one step forward for Microsoft and Intel, and a step backward for mankind.<br />  I love the full size Keyboard and the mouse and the isolated arrow keys.  I also prefer the separate mic/speaker ports to the single port PC's.<br />  The touchpad has faults. The edges are not well-defined, and in low light, you may find yourself off the edge of the pad without noticing it, except for the obvious lack of response. The touchpad buttons on my NB505 seem to drop sometimes even while pressed (it could just be me), IMO they could have been designed better. The XP synaptics driver is much better than the Win7 driver, IMO.<br />  The Rubberized coating on the outside of the case is great. In addition to adding a splash of color, it is highly functional at enhancing your grip when carrying it like a book.<br />  And, in case anyone even mentions the fact that the hi-resolution isn't supported, Well it is!  (VGA cable only, no HDMI). You just have to hook up an external display, like the Aquos TV to view hi-res to your heart's content. The built-in panel is clear with rich color but it also drives an external display very well.<br />  To adjust your display driver optimally for external display resolutions, you MUST feed the video out to the Monitor ONLY. If you clone the screens, you will get only the standard 1280x600 resolution and be disappointed (see my comments for display capabilities).<br />  The only game I have loaded is Torchlight...its a bit painful on the built-in display, but it works. Running Torchlight on an external display is excellent.<br />  If you don't get a lemon, (lemons are pretty rare), it's a solid machine. If you get a bad one, then for goodness sake run fast and return or exchange it as soon as you can, because I have heard terrible things about Toshiba support for problem hdwe. That being said, this is my 3rd Toshiba, shuffled between Compaq and Sony purchases and I have yet to get a lemon in any brand.<br /><br />  Update: The Lowdown on memory....The N455 supports DDR3 memory, but apparently, only at 667Mhz, NOT 1000Mhz. As of May 2011, DDR3 prices have fallen below the price of DDR2. Therefore, Toshiba and other vendors made an update to their motherboards or BIOS to outfit it with the DDR3 for the obvious savings.  But you will find that these netbooks are running the memory at below optimal speeds resulting in NO performance gain at all. So, don't be fooled into thinking that a DDR3 version of the same Netbook will outperform the DDR2 version.<br /><br />  Update: I run XP on my NB305-310 to get the most bang for my buck and I really love it (run more than a few apps at a time, choose your own screen background, exotic stuff like that, plus all those old programs you have invested $$ in actually run on XP)! I loaded XP on this NB505 in March and had to use the 305-310 drivers. So far everything works except Networking (internal and wireless). Still not sure why the networking is having trouble though all the other drivers seemed to work. (See my comments for XP driver recommendations.)<br /><br />  Update: I have loaded OpenOffice in lieue of upgrading my OFC'07 to OFC'10. Not only did I save some bucks, but OpenOffice has a much smaller footprint and a lot less memory leaks than OFC'07. It runs very smooth on the netbook and so far has been totally compatible with my OFC'07 Docs."

AGJ65RBRDHTPMXO4UMD23YVQESPQ,B0073RTGQM,5,1,True,"THIS IS A FULLY UNLOCKED PROCESSOR.........AND I would definately have to say that after 20 years of using nothing but intel, my first build using an AMD CPU was pleasantly suprising.  The processor is amazingly fast and overclocking was amazingly simple.  Although I won't get into technical details, I will give you a few pointers about this product.  I suggest that the maximum overclock you should attempt should be 4.8ghz.  Although its stated elsewhere that people have acheived between 5 and 5.2ghz I've notice that at anything above 4.8ghz some wierd things begin to happen even though your system appears stable after doing load testing with prime95.  You will also want to get a better aftermarket Heatsink/Fan Combo as the one that comes with it gets noisy under load and I mean noisy.  I used an older Coolmaster that I had and the temp difference was >8c even though the cooler is several years old.<br /><br />I will say that don't be suprised if you package arrives and upon opening it your notice that it doesn't contain the processor that you've ordered although the packaging is correct.  I've had several arrive over the last few months that have had older processors or processors that were return already because they were missing pins.

AGWY5ASQV4D2YISC7QHJEPSTUYSQ,B002A91X5A,5,1,True,"The first time I looked into buying a computer(around 8 years ago), I knew I wanted a tablet. I looked at the convertible tablets that were available then, but none was quite right. The technology just didn't seem ready yet. When I got another computer about 4 years ago, I looked again, and again the tablets that were available just didn't seem good enough for the price.<br />Now it's the ""year of the tablet"" and there's a whole flood of various tablet and iPad-ey devices that will hit the market. But I was tired of waiting, so I did my research (comparing the Motion Le1600, Motion Ls800, MotionLe1700, and Notion Ink Adam) and decided I would buy this Tablet-- the Motion Le1700.<br />It was SUCH a good decision! This tablet has a good deal of processing power-- Intel Core Duo, and a good screen. It's screen is just the right size for taking notes, annotating PDFs, or drawing sketches. Before I purchased it, I read reviews saying that this tablet had replaced the Wacom Cintiq for some artists-- the digitzer pen is Wacom, and it does work very well. Given that many graphics pads cost a few hundred dollars, this tablet was not too expensive since it gives me the equivalent of one of Wacom's interactive pen displays (which I would have to sell an organ to buy). The pen does have to be recalibrated when you use the tablet at different angles and orientations, but that's not hard to do.<br />The computer runs Windows 7 well. While Windows 7 is not made for touchscreens, this tablet is not a touchscreen. It only takes input from the pen (which is helpful in most cases-- e.g. no problems with palm rejection while drawing or writing). While the iPad is good for media consumption, it's only OK if you actually want to make something-- be it a document or a drawing. My tablet, on the other hand, is great for that: I use it to draw, to sketch ideas, to take notes. I've even figured out how to create animations using screencasting software on my tablet.<br />I am a student, and use my tablet in class often. I don't carry notebooks anymore-- everything's on  my tablet. I also have avoided buying many textbooks and instead finding ebooks and online resources that I can use. I find that note-taking on my tablet helps me stay more focused than note-taking on a laptop. There is not screen that separates me from the teacher, and writing longhand means that I stay occupied with writing the whole time, rather than typing so quickly that I am then tempted to fiddle around on the internet).<br />Though the tablet is not great for everything (I'm typing this on my laptop because I can type more quickly than I can write by hand), it is extremely useful for certain things. I read and annotate documents on my tablet (way better than doing it on a laptop.) It also has the benefit of being a second screen: most people use their computer and have some papers sitting on their desk beside them; I use my computer and my tablet together in the same way. The tablet is perfect for standard letter size documents, but also works acceptably for book-sized print. I have read a while ebook on this tablet.<br />Nothing is perfect: the tablet runs hot, the battery life is good but not fantastic, and it weighs a few pounds. Also, the power cord that I got with this tablet was slightly damaged (bought the tablet used), so I've had to order a new one to replace it.<br />Still, for $500, this tablet (bought used) was a great deal. I really enjoy it, and for my purposes, it is far better than most of the tablets that will come to market later this year. Why? Better pen input, more capability (this is a full computer, not just an oversized smartphone) and every port a computer would have.<br />I highly recommend this excellent tablet."

AHJLVEDB5WVDCHC4U5BHOVCBKKCQ,B082P5D8PJ,5,0,True,"The decal is really high quality.  It is thick and looks and feels as a high end skin should look and feel.  Basically if you are spending over $20.00 for a decal to fit a 13"" laptop it should be of that quality.  I had downloaded the owl photo from a site which provided free reference photos.*  I had considered a couple of my own photos and may have one I have taken of my car printed as well for my other laptop.  Having always had decals on my small electronic items, I am very familiar with the different qualities of decals for sale.  Without question, this one is as good as I have ever purchased.<br />There are installation instructions online which you can review, but it is basically fairly simple to do.  Make sure it doesn't need to be trimmed before you apply it to the top.  If trimming is needed, it is far easier to do before you apply it.  Because I am putting a hard plastic clear case over this (mPearl), I didn't trim where the computer edge slopes down a bit around 3/4s of the device.  If I didn't have that cover over the decal I might want to trim it to stop where that sloped edge begins, because it will leave an edge that is easy to pull if it goes over the slope.<br />I pulled down the backing on half of the decal (starting from the hinged edge) and made sure I had it on straight on the back and sides.  I then slowly pulled the backing off while I used my hand on the top side to smooth it down, making sure it was held taunt on the back edge.  If you get a wrinkle or a bubble pull up the edge closest to the bubble/wrinkle and reapply.  Use a credit card or a vinyl tool to roll out any small areas.  There are great YouTube videos that show how to do this.<br />Only after you are sure you have it exactly where you want it, do you remove the top layer.  Because this is so nice and thick it goes down with few to any bubbles coming up.  Basically the thinner the decal the more problems you will have with installation.  Ditto if not a flat surface.  I would recommend trimming if you have sloping edges on the top and don't plan to put a cover over it. (I will try to add a photo with the top applied, to demonstrate.)<br />I plan to have another one made using a photo of my car.  I have added some other free reference photo I downloaded and considered using. The last photo is one I took of my car which I plan to have printed up to use on another device. There are hundreds of free images available, just search by what it is you want to use as a skin.  For example, mine was obviously ""free reference photos eagles"" and ""free reference photos elephants/sky/trees, etc.  When you select the custom image, it may be necessary to crop it in order for it to fit within  the parameters set by the printers.  You can try several different images to see which one you like best.  You may also have to change the number of pixels, but truly that too is easy to do with even the simplest editing programs. Of course this company has a large number of images already set up for you to use and you may find what you want in their existing inventory<br />***A note on reference photos:  If you are using an image that you didn't personally create, the person who did the work is entitled to dictate how and if that image can be used by others.  In general most sites which allow you to copy an image for your personal use require it be just that: personal use, not reusing to make money on it for yourself.  It is someone else's work (intellectual property is just like anything else you make, write, sculpt, build, etc.  The person who made the initial image is entitled to any profits made from its' use.  I love photography and I want to encourage artists and photographers to share their work for personal use of others.)"

I assume Amazon will be upgrading to other video streaming services soon. Until then, four stars Amazon!<br /><br />VIDEO: no Netflix, Hulu, HBO, etc.  only videos available are Amazon Prime. naturally, for us Netflix watchers, this totally sucks.

AEX7NYGOPPRZMJNRNKUJCLECPW7A,B08T6C7892,3,6,True,"This is my fourth build with an ASUS Zx90-A mobo.  I previously had an i5-8600K paired with a PRIME Z370-A, an i9-9900K and i5-9600K both in PRIME Z390-A boards. All Intel, all with no issues. I wanted a white themed board and wasn't thrilled with the Gigabyte Vision D's BIOS support/updates WRT Thunderbolt support, so I went with this ROG Strix Z590-A paired with an i5-11600K, ID-Cooling ZoomFlow Snow 360, 3 x 3 packs of Lian Li SL120's, and an EVGA 3080 FTW UG jammed into an O11 Dynamic. 4JnHMv at PC Part Picker if you want the full details.<br /><br />Anyway, great out of the box. I'm running 1 x PCIe 4.0 M.2 EVO 980 Pro and 1 x EVO 970. I like the little clips for the M.2 drives, but wonder why they couldn't adjust the PCIe 4.0 slot to accept it as well (it interferes w/the fitment due to height and the extended length of the heat dissipater).<br /><br />I also appreciate that they've moved the obnoxious USB 3.0 header off of the bottom edge of the board and away from bottom fans/rads.<br /><br />The integrated IO shield is nice, plenty of fan, RGB, ARGB headers, and everything is just well put together in a logical arrangement.<br /><br />ASUS UEFI BIOS is...good enough to keep buying ASUS boards even after what happened with this one. (Foreshadowing...)<br /><br />I had Win 10 on a USB stick, the fresh 980 Pro and it all came up first time, ethernet connection drivers are pre-loaded onto the board, windows does its thing, and after another 15-20 minutes of reboots and updates it was good to go...to start updating.<br /><br />The Armour Crate utility is...somewhat iffy.  It has AuraSync buttons that take you to a web page that tells you to download Armour Crate. Yay for recursiveness.  It also ""checks"" for installation any software you haven't installed already so be careful or you'll end up with Norton on your machine.<br /><br />I also noticed that it was recommending I update my BIOS to the version after the one it shipped with but which was not the latest version.<br /><br />I also recommend, if you're using it (you can turn it off in the BIOS, btw, under the TOOLS page in advanced settings), that you wait until Windows Update is 100% done before running it for the first time. Then there'll be less back-and-forth between the two on who is installing which update over the other.<br /><br />So now the disappointing bit. 48 hours after initial power on the ethernet controller suddenly didn't have a driver associated with it. It was showing up under ""Other devices"" as ""Ethernet Controller"" but the Intel driver utility couldn't find any Intel ethernet controllers to install a driver for and the ASUS driver utility failed without verbose error messages (actually, any error messages) when running the devcon.exe command on the two device ID's that the Intel driver uses.  Oddly enough, I *could* install the wrong Intel driver, and the system knew it was the wrong one, but I couldn't install the correct driver.  In the end it appears the PCI Express Root Port #19 - 43C2 failed at the hardware level somehow.  Very, very odd.  I'm in ""the business"" and have seen a lot of different HW, SW, and FW failures but never that particular one.  Who knows - it could have been a wonky update of some firmware or the BIOS, but more likely just bad luck.<br /><br />On the plus side, almost 100% of the networking issues in the ROG forums are regarding the WiFi and that's working flawlessly.  All the other ports check out.<br /><br />Enabling the resizable BAR was even (from the mobo perspective) simple. Just select ""Resizable BAR"" in the BIOS (top of the screen in EzMode even) an set it to on or enabled or w/e.  Boom.  Well, ""Boom"" after updating the EVGA firmware. And the Nvidia drivers. And enabling it in Precision X1.  (Not specific to this mobo, but PX1 at least has a 5 step checklist to green up to enable it - correct OS, GPU, VBIOS, Driver, and mobo.)<br /><br />All in all the tech support was okay. I'm not sure that the level 1 folks understood exactly what steps I had taken to fix the ethernet controller issue or how painful all of the reloads, rollbacks, etc., were. But they offered to either RMA the board or, if I was still within the return period, recommended just sending it back to Amazon for a replacement.<br /><br />So here I am, writing the review and wondering if I should stick with another -A model for the white or just go for the -E and have some contrast since the GPU is already black and the grommets and knockouts in the O11 D are black and for whatever reason the white SL120 Lian Li fans have black sleeved connectors.<br /><br />BL: I would purchase another ASUS board...will purchase another ASUS board, but not sure if it'll be this one out of a fear that whatever sequence I did installs and updates in will occur again and brick the ethernet controller - if it wasn't just an unlucky HW failure."
AEHCLZ7A6PH2TEZPGKRHG72VE25A,B004KKZ0H4,4,11,True,"I bought this camera as a backup to my DSLR and for those instances when I just want to travel light.  So far, it hasn't disappointed.<br /><br />First for the cons:  Just like most (if not all) point and shoots, indoor pics and flash pics suffer a little.  The flash leaves a hard, metallic tone on the images and redeye is common.  The camera has a reduction mode, but I never use it, I find the 'double flash' confuses posing subjects and results in movement and akward facial expressions.  I also don't like that the proprietary battery has to be removed from the camera for charging.  So far, battery life is excellent, but I haven't kept track of how many pictures/flashes/image reviews I can do between plug ins. Lastly, the camera is a bit thicker than I would have hoped for.  Some of the comparable products on the market are considerably thinner.<br /><br />As for the pros:  the camera takes great, high resolution outdoor shots.  I've had good luck with automatic mode as well as Av, Sv and the various scene modes it offers.  Color balance is very accurate with WB set to automatic, although images captured with chosen WB settings  neon, indoor) came out well also.  I also like that the advanced user can dial up or dial down exposure by fractions of stops, and I believe the camera can autobracket as well, although I haven't tried it yet. Lastly, the menus and the user interface is very intuitive and easy to understand. If you've been around digital cameras for any length of time, you should be able to figure this one out without reading the users' manual.  Digital zoom and image stabilization, both big selling points for this camera don't figure much into my shooting style, so I can't provide intelligent commentary on either.<br /><br />Although I much prefer my big, bulky DSLR to ANY point and shoot pocket camera, I know that on days I bring this one along, at least I'll get clean, crisp, high quality pictures of my unforgettable moments."

AFSLWHUFZASJJUGE7FJ66KYUC2AQ,B0155OC26U,4,805,False,"Let me say this right up front; I've enjoyed Apple iPads since they were introduced. However, I also use Android tablets, and have enjoyed those equally, including the Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1, several Sonys, many iterations of the Nexus line, and my phone of choice is a Galaxy Note 4. So yes, I am a fan of Apple, but I'm equally a fan of Android. I don't see either platform as being better, just different.<br /><br />With that being said, I will say that the iPad Pro is a beautiful, amazing piece of tech. It's HUGE (basically the size of two iPad Air 2s side by side.), but that screen is gorgeous to see. But what ultimately tipped me over to buying one is the speakers and the Pencil stylus. I'd love to give this a 5, but there are definitely a couple of factors that keep me from doing so. The first is the cost. This thing is EXPENSIVE enough to give you justifiable pause. You could buy yourself a nice powerful gaming laptop, like the [[ASIN:B00YFE546W CUK MSI GE62 Apache 15.6-Inch Gaming Laptop (Intel Core i7-5700HQ Processor, 1TB 7200rpm HDD , NVIDIA GTX 960M, 12GB RAM, Windows 10 Operating System)]] for the same, if not lower, price. In other words, I don't know if most people could justify the cost. But if you can, it has a great deal to offer in the way of power and true tablet capabilities that definitely set the iPad Pro apart, but you'll have to plunk down another $100 for the Pencil stylus to fully unlock those capabilities. It's undoubtedly the best digitizer for everything from note taking to masterpiece artwork, and I can easily see the potential for growth far beyond into just about every type of app, even games. It's literally like writing or drawing on a piece of paper. Apple may be late, but when they execute, they make it as close to perfect as possible.<br /><br />And the sound is far above and beyond that of ANY tablet, and even most notebooks, including most gaming machines. While the truly deep bass is lacking, the overall experience still has plenty of punch from lows to highs, and rewatching movies or playing videos or music gives you a rich soundscape that let's you hear things you didn't even know were there, from subtle instrument whispers to the slightest of reverb, and it makes the experience far more enjoyable because of it. And amazingly, dialogue stays true and evident even when accompanied by the loudest of effects. I'm not sure how Apple pulled it off, but I'm extremely glad they did. I've been waiting a long time for any tablet to have this level of sonic ability.  It sounds so good that it makes all the Dolby (or other) enhancements sound like a gimmick. Playing games, especially ones you've played before, brings immersiveness to a whole new level. You really have to experience it to believe it.<br /><br />While the screen is crisp and rich with color, I do see one other factor that leads me to hold back that last star, and that factor is screen brightness. Even at full brightness, it's not nearly as bright as other iPads, and I suspect that Apple HAD to do this in order to maximize battery life while keeping down the weight and thickness. I'm not saying that it's bad by any means, it's just not what you expect from an iPad. At least, that's been my experience.<br /><br />But as a whole, I think this beast of a tablet offers the best iPad experience so far, whether for casual use or the most demanding tasks. Multitasking is not only possible, but actually worth it because of the A9X processor and ample screen real estate.  The bottom line is this: if you don't want to get one of these, then don't go look at one. You've been warned.<br /><br />PROS:<br />Silky smooth performance, even when multitasking.<br />Rich sound that's truly exceptional, and not just OK.<br />The most natural, responsive digitizer capabilities, ever.<br />HUGE, crisp screen.<br /><br />CONS:<br />Screen brightness not nearly as good as other iPads.<br />Pencil stylus not included.<br />EXPENSIVE, EXPENSIVE, EXPENSIVE."

And going from my 24 inch PC monitor to a 14 inch laptop is something I am still not used to months after buying it.<br /><br />As for price, It was a best buy one time deal that sold out quick at $249.99. They had had it a few months prior for $279.99.<br /><br />Heck, by black friday, you can probably get something similar for $199.<br />----------<br />EDIT, after about 2 and a half years, this laptop became essentially unusable with more than 1 window.<br />I bought & added a 4gb stick of memory and its much better.<br /><br />I had a bit of an issue installing it. I has to snap in place and you put it in at an angle. Not to mention there is 24 or 26 screws. I think I lost one.<br /><br />I guess it maxes out at 8gb ram. Mine came with a 2gb stick so I just added the 4.<br />original post around 9/2011. Updated Feb 2015<br /><br />12/2016, I just bought a better laptop, a refurb from Walmart for $325.

AE5PIHGU5M3BMPLKHD4CIF7BLSDA,B07XM6XZ1F,3,0,True,"I bought a PCIe BT/WiFi card expecting it to use a PCIe slot. Instead, it requires not only a PCIe slot but an internal USB header as well, which makes me question the competence of the designers. How hard is it to make everything work over PCIe?<br /><br />So I had to sacrifice a USB header, which, on this motherboard, means I have no front-panel ports any more. And now I'm reading about issues with the Intel WiFi chipset drivers on AMD CPUs… I have a Ryzen. If I notice one problem, this thing's going back."

AFSBI5RB44ME3CG7MYWOW4IO7MVA,B015XBK5NM,5,4,False,"Summary: Acer built an excellent gaming and multi-media laptop with a few minor niggles.  Closer to 4.5 than 5 stars, but 4 is probably way too low.<br /><br />Specs: the combination of the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M, 16 gigs of DD4 Ram, and the Intel Core i7-6700HQ 2.6 GHz mean you can really use the nice 17&#34; 1080p IPS screen to its fullest.  And the Dolby audio set-up really shined for Netflix use (maybe a little too well- spoiler alert).  The main drive is a SSD which is nice, but most of the storage is on an old dumb and very slow 5400 RPM hard drive.  If you are handy swap that for another SSD quickly (see the top reviews for a nice walk through on that, tip of the cap to those reviewers!).<br /><br />Unboxing was very nice, Acer majorly stepped up in the packaging, instructions and guides.  You can see their desire to move upmarket with this.  Everything was out of the box and plugged in quickly, with zero hassles.  Registration was easy through their pre-installed apps.<br /><br />Set-up.  A small step back, as Acer moves away from the premium approach with a bit too much pre-loaded junk and trialware.  I spent about an hour deleting off all the trialware, bloatware and various freeium games.  In fairness, part of that was also configuring Windows defender, Firefox and downloading various patches.  This is when I also noticed the Aspire V17's near magic ability to acquire fingerprints.  CSI would love this thing. . .<br /><br />Gaming. As the screen is a 1080p set-up, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960M was sufficient to run Civilization5 and Fallout4 at reasonable details (plugged in to the wall).  You will need a mouse, as the track pad and games don't mix well IMHO.  The IPS screen pops nicely, and no issues with dead pixels or other flaws were seen.  It does get louder as the fans ramp up for gaming, but that's to be expected.<br /><br />Multimedia.  Ugh, its really good at this.  WAAAAAAAAAAY too good.  Once my associate tester borrowed it for some Netflix (props to the quality wireless card in this, 5g wireless networking throughout my house), I heard nothing but raves about the bright screen, the Dolby speakers, the light weight compared to her old laptop, the solid battery life when playing video.  At this point, I knew I was in trouble.  On went Quicken, then, troublingly- iTunes.  Soon she was happily blasting her tunes, surfing the web and doing work on the Aspire V17.  I on the other hand, was realizing I no longer had a laptop, but was granted visitation rights in her office.  Oh well.<br /><br />Acer really has specced a nice gaming/multimedia laptop.  Other than its crazy affinity for fingerprints, pokey 5400 storage drive and need for a decent mouse for gaming I really liked the Acer Aspire V17 Nitro Black Edition and one day I hope to get to use it again."
AFSBI5RB44ME3CG7MYWOW4IO7MVA,B005O65JXI,4,1,True,"Quite, cheap and does a much better job in all aspects that the stock Intel heatsink/fan.  Downside is the installation is rather fiddly and more of a pain than other aftermarket heat sinks.  The other issue is that the large overhang means it will hit (or come close) to most performance RAM heat sinks when installed."
AFSBI5RB44ME3CG7MYWOW4IO7MVA,B009LTUE9S,5,50,False,"The HP Envy 23-d030 23-Inch Desktop is HP's top of line all in one desktop computer for use with the new Windows 8 experience.  Windows 8 is all about tiles and touch.  All of the major functions are displayed in tiles (although the regular old desktop is available for Windows 7 power users). And HP worked very hard to integrate the multitouch functions into how you use (and think) about the Envy.  With 10 point touch- the screen is now a true replacement for the keyboard.  But a nice HP wireless keyboard and mouse are included (and work well with Windows 8, which matters with some of your apps).<br /><br />The packing was well done, and the instructions were clear.  A nice bonus were the helpful videos in the HP tiles section.  Consider watching those mandatory, as you will flounder a bit learning the needed gestures and ""charms"" without them.  I tried to dive right in, and was rather frustrated until I watched the videos.  Now its pretty intuitive.  In fact, my Windows 7 machine now has a few finger prints on its monitor from me instinctively touching the screen.  I also got a chance to use HP's Customer Service.  The little USB dongle which enables the wireless keyboard and mouse was missing.  I fired up the online chat support with rather low expectations.  Well, I was pleasantly surprised.  After 15 minutes, a new wireless mouse and dongle were ordered for me.  Even better, they sent it overnight FedEx!  I had it the next day, no muss no fuss.  Nice to see the ""Award Winning Service"" isn't some empty slogan- HP means it.  There will be more HP products in my future.<br /><br />Setup was pretty easy overall.  The Envy comes with b/g/n WiFi receiver built in- I just let it on my network and it was ready to go.  While HP doesn't harass you the instant the machine is activated to register, I eventually did register it with an helpful Windows 8 app they included.  After I did, it offered to uninstall itself-- clever.  The only trialware of note was the Norton Antivirus- it was a bit obnoxious about getting you to purchase the full version.  Don't be a sucker.  Go to the control panel, uninstall that junk and turn on the quality Windows Defender and Firewall- both are well designed, work great and are free and already on your computer. Don't forget to run Windows Update- there were plenty of critical updates waiting.  All in all, after an hour I had the computer updated, organized and how I like it.<br /><br />So how does it run?  The 2.7 GHz Intel Core i5 is more power than most applications will ever need.  And starting with 6 gigs of RAM certainly is a nice touch as well.  Plenty of future proofing in that combination.  The 23 inch screen is bright and clear and runs at 1920 x 1080 pixels, perfect for blue ray DVDs and streaming HD movies.  Gaming is doable as well.  While Crisis II isn't in your future due to the built in Intel graphics card- I was able to run Civilization 5 on the Envy without issue.<br /><br />Other things that stood out to me- its really quiet.  Its a nice exterior design overall.  And the Envy seems ""friendly"", almost cheerful.  My wife, who isn't a computer person normally took to the Envy right away.  30 seconds after showing her how it works, she was happily poking away at the various tiles and Windows 8 Apps.  I have a feeling it won't be long before she claims it.<br /><br />In summary, I was very pleased and more that a little surprised at the HP Envy.  It really is the best showcase of everything Microsoft is trying the achieve with Windows 8.  While some users may not like the touch and tile orientation of Windows 8 over the Desktop/Mouse/Keyboard of Windows 7, I didn't mind it.  Having been a long term iPhone and iPad user- I get the touch screen revolution. This is where home computers (and eventually our TVs) are going.  Other than hardcore gaming and professional level video editing, there wasn't much the cheerful Envy wouldn't be good at.  In my book, the HP Envy 23-d030 Desktop is the definitive Windows 8 experience."
AEII54OV6OOTX4WDMZLL4DFLUF4Q,B003UCPCB2,5,4,False,"Purchased this at Fry's Electronics for $399. There is a rebate associated with it for $50. I live in Illinois so I had to pay sales tax. Still under $400 out the door after the rebate (been told it takes 3 months or so) but that's no big deal.<br /><br />Quick start up guide suggested I make an msi recovery disc set upon 1st boot, so I did (easy but slow - 8x is the highest speed on the included optical drive). Removed all the bloatware (not much actually came pre-installed) with PCDecrapifier. Black pinstripe finish is different (highly susceptible to fingerprints & smudges). Battery is good for about 3 hours (maybe a little less) with light use (msi's WIND series can go for 15 hours - WOW).<br /><br />Bonus warranty: Upon receipt of my mail in registration form, msi extends their manufacturer's warranty to 3 years! Pretty sweet! (If you get this make sure you get at least 3 rebate receipts or make copies for all the forms you have to send in).<br /><br />Fry's customer service is pretty lousy - I placed the order online & went in to pick it up with a hard copy of my receipt in hand. They had no record of the order and I had to wait a 1/2 hour for them to figure that out & then another 1/2 hour to take me over to the returns desk to place & process a new order. Took forever and they weren't that busy. They did NOTHING to make it up to me. Also, BE AWARE, Fry's charges a 15% restocking fee on laptops - no exceptions. That is $60 out of your pocket on this A6200-428US if something goes wrong or if you change your mind after you open it.<br /><br />How does it work? Boots fast. Runs cool & quiet. Nice display. A lot of connectivity (USB 2.0 x 3, Express Card, Video Port: VGA (15-pin, D-Sub), HDMI, Audio Ports: Mic-in, Headphone output,). I really like the msi ""chiclet"" keyboard and number pad. Thin and light, easy to carry but the display doesn't lock when you close the laptop - just something to be aware of. Wireless LAN found my home network right away. I bought this to use for school and it is overkill for the typical ""student"" requirements.<br /><br />Cons: Power button has a bright blue LED. It is just under the screen located at the top right side of the keyboard - distracting when reading the screen (nothing a piece of tape can't fix). Due to the short battery life I want to buy another battery just in case. Overall, this is pretty hard deal to beat.<br /><br />Includes:<br />Windows 7, 64 bit<br />Fast Intel® Pentium® Dual Core Processor P6000 with a 1066MHz FSB & a 2MB cache<br />320 GB 5400 RPM SATA HD is partioned into 2 halves (or close to it)<br />3GB 1066MHz DDR3 SO DIMM(upgradable to 8 gigs (2 slots))<br />4-in-1 Card Reader (SD/MMC/MS/XD)<br />LAN Ethernet LAN 10/100<br />WLAN Built-in 802.11b/g/n WLAN Card<br />Stereo speakers (not bad for a laptop)<br />1.3MP Web cam with microphone (not great but works ok)<br />Optical Drive Type: DVD Super Multi (slow)<br /><br />*UPDATE* I am now at the 4 month point of ownership and felt like updating my review.<br /><br />After all the constant updates for Windows the computer is using 50% of the RAM all the time - just to run the machine. Makes running other programs difficult. I had McAfee installed and that bogged it down even more. Uninstalled McAfee and installed Kaspersky. Kaspersky seems to be working better.<br /><br />About two months ago a friend of mine got an [[ASIN:B0045GV36U HP 15.6"" Pavilion dv6-3122us Turion II Entertainment 4GB Laptop 500GB Notebook PC]] and it blows away the msi for only $100 more at the times of respective purchase. The display, software suite, webcam, audio, storage, graphics, and speed are all superior on the hp. Even the finish on the outside is superior in that it doesn't show fingerprints everywhere like the msi.<br /><br />I just got the rebate from msi last week. My friend got their rebates from hp before I got mine from msi and they sent them in 2 months after I did.<br /><br />The webcam has been problematic. I try to skype with other students but they cannot hear me unless I call them on my cell. I've checked all the settings and everything is supposed to be working fine but the msi warns that the connection isn't strong enough to support this service. I have a desktop in the same room, farther away from the wireless gateway and it handles web conferences just fine. Has to be the msi. The audio is really quiet. All the way up I can hardly hear professors & fellow students.<br /><br />I've ordered more RAM for the msi hoping this will speed it back up. If I plug in headphones I can hear others during conferences. They can't hear me but there is a spot where I can ""chat"". I use sticky keys when zi type and the msi is very slow to recognize or doesn't recognize at all the keys being pressed. When writing an essay it misses the first couple of key strokes when it's running slow. There is no bloatware on my pc and there are very few programs installed. Not many applications or processes running in the background either. So I have no idea why the msi is running as slow as it is these days.<br /><br />It seemed really good at first. basic. simple. just enough to get the job done. I'd lower it to 2 stars if I could and I would have bought the hp instead seeing as I just shelled out $80 to upgrade the RAM to full capacity on it. The msi is / feels heavier than the hp too."
AHZVNDBSVL6BWGT2446JDYEDQUJQ,B08XFP324G,5,1,False,"Review model: Alienware m15 R4, RTX 3080 15.6 inch Gaming Laptop FHD (Full HD) - Intel Core i7-10870H, 32GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB SSD, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 8GB GDDR6, Windows 10 Home - Lunar Light<br /><br />TL; DR: This laptop is ridiculous. I’m sure there’s probably some bonkers game out there that requires some kind of space-aged rig to play, but I can’t realistically think of anything this laptop won’t run right now. The fan will pretty much always be on; power like this comes with a lot of heat. Battery life is trash, but again--this is a powerful computer. It’s not exactly in the “light and portable” category. If laptops are your jam, but you want to run the newest stuff at the highest settings possible (and you’ve got the budget), you can’t really go wrong here.<br /><br />Form factor:<br />This laptop is beautiful. I love the Lunar Light color scheme. The RGB keyboard is awesome and easily adjusted to your colors and themes of choice using the Alienware control app. The base of the laptop is really well designed--there’s a couple of inches of additional laptop out behind the screen in the back, which is great as a counterweight for stability (and for extra ventilation). The honeycomb details are beautiful. The laptop is thinner than I expected, but still no lightweight computer--it’s heavy by today’s standards, but feels super stable on your table or desk. Although most of your heat exhaust will go out to the sides and back of the machine, If possible, elevating or using a cooling pad will help with heat dissipation. The keyboard will warm up when the system is working under load.<br /><br />Screen & Sound:<br />This is the best laptop screen I’ve ever seen. It’s elevated a couple of inches above the keyboard, which actually makes the screen feel bigger. Aspect ratio is perfect. The matte finish keeps away the glare, and images are crisp. When I set up the laptop on my desk, though, I initially connected it to an almost brand new Samsung 27in Odyssey G3 via HDMI. I had some odd stuttering during gameplay that I hadn’t had on the laptop’s monitor. Figuring it was the cable, I tried a brand new 4K DisplayPort cable, and that did work much better. Sound quality is actually fantastic. The onboard speakers sound great! But… are sort of overshadowed by the sound of the fans. The fans are not loud or unpleasant sounding, but are kind of a white noise that dulls the music and sound effects from whatever you’re trying to listen to. I’ve been happily using headphones.<br /><br />Keyboard and touchpad:<br />The keyboard feels amazing. It’s, of course, not mechanical, but if that’s what you’re used to, I’d say the feel is closest to what you’d get with brown switches, but with a bit of blue-switch click and near silence. There’s a satisfying resistance upon keypress that provides excellent feedback. Keys are well sized and spaced; nothing is in the wrong place and no rogue keys will throw off your touch typing. The touchpad feels great and is very responsive, but it’s really small. Honestly, though, I barely use it. I’ve got my trusty mouse plugged in. Touchpads are not super conducive to gaming.<br /><br />General Performance:<br />This laptop has all the power you need to do normal stuff and some extra stuff, like video/photo editing and game streaming. You can run OBS in the background or edit clips later, and not have to worry about the computer freezing up on you. If you’re fully digital and download a ton of games and/or videos, 1TB of storage can actually go kind of fast, but you’ve also got a micro-SD slot and 3 USB ports for extra memory space to put old stuff on ice until you need it again. Wi-Fi is outstanding. If your router is rated for it, the wi-fi 6 is definitely speedy. I downloaded and installed 80GB of WoW in under 40 minutes in the B-net client; Code Vein (35BG) came in under 11 minutes, with Steam games averaging 3-4GB per minute. If you want to connect even faster, this laptop has something I haven’t seen on a laptop in a long time--an ethernet port! Plug in via CAT-6 (or 7 or 8…) and you’ll be good to go!<br /><br />Gaming Performance:<br />I’ve tested three games with this laptop at length.<br />*World of Warcraft (Shadowlands) - Ultra settings (slider at 10), consistently getting 100-120 fps in open world, combat, capital cities. Absolutely beautiful.<br />*Outriders - Ultra settings. Looks beautiful (better than on PS4). Visuals are smooth, spell effects, creatures, environments look great. No stuttering or screen tearing; excellent draw distance.<br />*Code Vein - Ultra settings. Gameplay is responsive and looks beautiful. Environments are crisp, spell effects are lovely and no graphics-related lag (which can be fatal in a ragequit kind of game like this). I had some stuttering in this game when connecting to an external monitor via HDMI; improved when switched to a DP connection instead. Consistently pristine visuals on laptop monitor.<br /><br />Customizations:<br />There are two apps you’ll want to get familiar with on this computer--The Nvidia “GeForce Experience” app and the Alienware Control Center. The GeForce app lets you fine tune your graphics driver and game-by-game optimizations. It lets you see what kind of performance you can get out of each game by various metrics, fiddle with those settings if you want to, and run your games right from the app. The Alienware Control Center lets you customize your overall system. You can check your various temperature gauges, set conditions for cooling themes and GPU settings, and change the RGB settings for the keyboard. You can create individual settings profiles for each game you play, or set system-wide settings--whatever you want. You can even overclock the CPU right from within the app without having to mess around in BIOS."
AHZVNDBSVL6BWGT2446JDYEDQUJQ,B091D6F3JP,5,79,False,"I received the HP Pavilion x360 Convertible 14-dw1024nr.<br /><br />Specs:<br />-Intel Core i5-1135G7 processor<br />-512GB SSD<br />-8GB SDRAM<br />-Intel IrisXe Integrated Graphics<br />-Ports: 1 HDMI, 2 USB, 1 USB-C, 1 Standard SD, Headphone/mic<br /><br />Aesthetics 5/5<br /><br />The 14in Pavilion x360 is a great looking laptop. The dark gray interior is a great contrast to the matte-silver lid. The design is squared, rather than curved, but uses curves judiciously to avoid looking too boxy. The shiniest elements are the chrome-coated (but internally plastic) 360 hinges and the HP logo on the lid. These are, of course, fingerprint magnets. The rest of the laptop is pretty easy to keep clean. The computer is light and easy to flip between laptop and tablet mode. I don’t imagine using “tablet” mode very much, as the computer is much larger and heavier than an actual tablet, but with the ability to (purchase separately) use a stylus to do markups and use touch applications when appropriate, different configurations can be useful.<br /><br />Keyboard & Touchpad 3/5<br /><br />The keyboard layout is pleasantly standard. You won’t find any too-small shift keys to squish the size and nothing is in the wrong place for a touch-typist. That being said, I’m not loving this keyboard. It’s hard to put my finger on exactly why. It doesn’t feel BAD, but it doesn’t feel good. The keys themselves are very slightly textured, but the letter labels are very large and add an odd slickness to the texture that lead to a little bit of slippage when typing. Travel is responsive and even a bit clicky, but a little short and ends abruptly, like the keys could use a little more cushion. There is no backlighting (which wasn’t expected, but good to clarify). I have used better and worse keyboards.<br /><br />The touchpad is relatively large, for the size of the laptop. It’s just under 4.5”x3”. It will feel small compared to other laptops. My Macbook Air’s touchpad, for instance, is 4.75”x3.25” and makes better use of even less real estate. The touchpad has an almost paper-like feel--it’s not smooth, but not rough. You’re not going to be slipping around. It’s responsive out of the box, with taps and standard multi-touch gestures tracked without issue. The lower quarter of the trackpad can be pressed for right and left clicks, or you can use single and double finger taps.<br /><br />General Performance 5/5 (for the price)<br /><br />Initial startup was fast and painless on this laptop. The Tiger Lake i5 handles everyday multitasking without drama. 8GB of ram is just enough for most applications. The i5 and 8GB of ram is likely not enough for demanding applications like 4k video editing (If that’s your jam, you’re gonna be looking at higher tier machines than this…) But for normal stuff, this laptop is going to be pretty up to the task. These specs are pretty in line with the laptop’s price point and make for a solid mid-range laptop.<br /><br />The 500GB SSD that I received is a good size for an everyday laptop. The hard drive is snappy. Games and files load nice and fast.<br /><br />One area where this laptop especially shines is WiFi. The WiFi 6 antennas make a noticeable difference in download speeds. Between gaming and WFH, we throw down for some pretty good internet speeds at home… and this laptop takes full advantage, downloading Steam games at an average of 55MB/s--or about 4GB per minute. Over WIFI. That’s right up there with my husband’s high-end gaming rig.<br /><br />Graphics/Gaming 4.5/5 (for the price)<br /><br />I was really intrigued by the IrisXe graphics. I’ve kept up on this development a little bit, and was interested to see how well gaming went with this computer. I didn’t go hardcore--there are benchmarks out there for anyone to look up, but looking at the benchmarks and performance on this computer, my conclusion is that processor makes a bit difference. A lot of the benchmarks I’ve seen for stellar performance for the Xe in gaming has been with a Tiger Lake i7. This computer has an i5. Even still, I was impressed at how well it handled mid-range gaming for this price point.<br /><br />I tested:<br /><br />- World of Warcraft (Shadowlands/retail): Averaged a playable 24 fps at max graphics settings out in open world (would certainly require custom lower settings in raids/pvp to remain playable). Steady at 55-60 fps at med/custom settings with lower texture and spell detail. Granted, the fan was going hard even during short sessions at max, so it would be smart to turn things down.<br />- Dungeon Defenders Awakening: High graphics settings played very smooth with no lag or screen tearing. Full spell effects. Lovely.<br />- Evil Genius 2: This one actually ran better on this computer than on my i7 laptop with a discrete Nvidia card and vram… I’m not totally sure why, but it did. Building and management sim with lots of different things going on on the screen at once, and this computer handled it well. Med/high graphics settings."
AHZVNDBSVL6BWGT2446JDYEDQUJQ,B08P53H7GV,5,3,False,"Review for model Alienware Aurora R11 Gaming Desktop 10th Gen Intel Core i7, 16GB Dual Channel HyperX Fury DDR4 XMP, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080, 1TB HDD + 512GB SSD, Killer Wi-Fi 6.<br /><br />We are gamers in our house, but we’ve never really had the means to be like, “ultra settings” gamers. We’ve done a lot of settling over the years… playing MMOs on minimum-to-medium graphics, turning all the cool stuff down to improve framerates… (especially in raids or PVP…) This is not a computer you’ll need to do that with. Pretty much ever.<br /><br />I’m not going to do benchmarks here, because anybody who is looking at a computer like this can go and look those up. But I’ll talk a little about our setup and real world play tests on a few games.<br /><br />First, the download experience. Honestly, when I saw “Killer Wi-Fi” in the product description, I thought “how different can wi-fi be? Wi-Fi is wi-fi.” I was so wrong. Hubby and I both downloaded games at different times from our Steam accounts and independently happened to mention to each other… “Hey, was it just me, or did your download of (insert game) go like, really fast?” Your mileage will vary, of course, depending on your home internet speeds, but we throw down for some pretty good internet (work from home, right?) and we were both just shocked by how much faster this tower downloaded large files compared to either of our older (but still decent) machines.<br /><br />World of Warcraft (Shadowlands - retail): Ultra settings, slider to 10. Consistent 60fps. No lag, even in Org, Stormwind, Dal, etc. I’ve been playing this game since Vanilla, and saw stuff for the first time playing on this computer. Full spell effects, spectacular draw distance… what game was I playing before? The only lag spikes I had were connection/server related.<br /><br />Total War: Warhammer II (Steam): I watched my husband play a Greenskins v. Brettonia max size match just to see how much action he could get on the screen. There were easily 800 units on the screen duking it out at max graphics. No problem.<br /><br />Outriders (Demo - Steam): This is a brand new game that we also played on PS4, so it was fun to compare the console vs. PC graphics. The game defaulted to ultra graphics and handled it without breaking a sweat. Visuals were slightly better on the PC than on PS4, but the PC had noticeably fewer lag spikes, screen tearing issues, etc--very smooth. Spell/combat effects, terrain and backgrounds look great.<br /><br />Other things to know:<br /><br />- This Alienware tower does also have some Alienware software designed specifically for gaming. It has an “app” that lets you fiddle with things like the color and pulse of the LEDs on the case. You can also create overclocking profiles for various games without having to mess with BIOS.<br />- This tower is quite loud. Fan intake is on the side, air outflow is through the top. The fans run most of the time. Headphones recommended.<br />- So many ports. Seriously. All the ports. If you run out of USB ports, you’ve got even more peripherals than I do. Congrats.<br />- Comes with stock (Dell) wired mouse and keyboard.<br />- Automatic windows update on some hardware components is a little sluggish. I manually updated the vid card driver day one, as Windows didn’t flag it for update right away."
AHZVNDBSVL6BWGT2446JDYEDQUJQ,B086QR47SP,4,3,False,"TL;DR:<br /><br />I’ve got a lot to say about the Surface Book 3 (15in i7/16GB/256SSD), so if there are details you’d like more info about, read on. If you’re looking for a bottom line, here it is up front. This is a solid laptop at a premium price point. You can get very solid laptops for a much more reasonable price. So ultimately, I think what you’re paying a premium for with this machine is simple versatility.<br /><br />This computer can literally be all things to all people (or it tries pretty hard and comes pretty close). I have gamed with it at totally respectable framerates. I have pulled off the tablet and used the pen to grade papers and mark up PDFs. I have even propped the tablet up on a stand like a monitor with a bluetooth mouse and keyboard and used it like a desktop. I have done conference calls and drawn on the whiteboard to review determinants of Demand with my AP Macroeconomics class...<br /><br />Can you do these things without a super expensive laptop? Absolutely. But I’ve amassed a collection of peripherals over the years to do stuff that you can “just do” with this laptop easily and without having to watch any Youtube training videos. And I can see that being a tradeoff a lot of people are willing to invest in.<br /><br />While this is a very good laptop, I do not believe it is totally worth the full price, primarily due to the lack of SSD space, some underwhelming design choices, disappointing real-world battery life, and the availability of other laptops with very comparable (and even better) specs for more competitive prices. For these reasons, I think this Surface Book 3 (15in) earns 4 stars out of 5.<br /><br />Details:<br /><br />Keyboard & Touchpad<br /><br />- Responsive keyboard with good travel, bounce and clicky-ness. Comfortable key spacing and key positions. Nothing is in a weird position for touch typists--very easy to immediately pick up and use. Accidental touchpad swipes with your wrists will be rare. Good ergonomic typing experience. This is a really, really nice keyboard.<br />- Keyboard backlighting with three settings. Translucent key labels light up the lettering on the higher two settings for good visibility in darker work environments.<br />- Indicator LEDs on CAPS and Fn keys.<br />- Touchpad is smooth, if a little small. It’s responsive out-of-the-box to standard multi-touch gestures. Zones for right and left clicks are intuitive and work well.<br />- Some extra hard-keys: a “right click” menu key on the right side of the keyboard, bottom row, between the left arrow key and “Alt.” Opens up the “right click” menu wherever your cursor is. In the top row next to “Del,” is a key to unlock the monitor so it can be removed to be used in tablet mode. (You can also do this using an icon in the tray.)<br /><br />Software & Startup<br /><br />- Initial start-up on this machine was one of the longest I’ve ever experienced on a Windows computer. The hamster wheel was turning good and hard on this laptop between occasional user inputs for language, wifi password and permissions before actually loading Windows for the first time. Maybe there were some updates going through, but I was surprised how long it took given the i7 processor.<br />- One of the best things about a Microsoft branded computer is that there’s almost no bloatware. Business users may feel a need to uninstall “Xbox” and game-related Microsoft apps that come preloaded, but that’s about it.<br />- All Office programs (right down to Access!) come preinstalled, but you do need to subscribe to Office365 or buy a full license to use them. If you already have Office 365 and logged into Windows/OneDrive using your Microsoft account during startup, the system will automatically detect your login info, confirm you want to use those credentials, and verify your license. It was absolutely painless and instant to start using Word and Excel with my existing Office account.<br /><br />Processor, Graphics & Storage<br /><br />- Processor: Intel Core i7 1.30GHz; 16 GB RAM<br />- Integrated Graphics PLUS discrete NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660Ti with Max-Q Design (6 GB dedicated memory)<br />- You’ve probably seen processors with higher speeds. I have noticed, though, that this laptop is pretty efficient and runs cool. I haven’t run into any issues with software hanging up--even Chrome (energy hog that it is) has been running great with MANY tabs open. I get smooth video when conferencing and screen-sharing, too. If you commonly run really intensive programs, you might need more power.<br />- Graphics-wise, you can use the NVIDIA Control Panel to let the system automatically decide which GPU to use for programs or you can set a GPU (integrated Intel or the NVIDIA card) for the whole system or app-by-app.<br />- I did need to manually update the NVIDIA driver, which immediately gave me a slight FPS boost while gaming.<br />- The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1660Ti with Max-Q Design GPU has been out since 2019 and has been benchmarked with games released in 2020. It is not a top-of-the-line, GPU, but it’s not bad. If you’re interested in playing games with it, do a quick search for benchmarks. My research shows respectable FPS in most recent games. My game of choice is World of Warcraft, in which I get consistent 60 FPS on custom-high settings.<br />- The 250GB Hard Drive is probably my biggest bone to pick with this laptop. If you do anything with high def video or image processing, that space is going to disappear really quick. Be prepared to buy extra cloud space or make frequent use of an SD card or external hard drive. More hard drive space is available with models equipped with additional RAM, so it’s worth considering if this is really where you want to save some money, or if the extra space is something you might need.<br /><br />Screen, Power & Battery Life<br /><br />- The screen is really beautiful. Images and text are very crisp and colors are bold. Battery settings can result in some rogue brightness changes. When using the monitor in tablet mode, remember to watch your hands and don’t cover up the ambient light sensors.<br />- The aspect ratio of the screen is more square than the very “letterbox” rectangle screens we’ve become used to in the last 10 years. While this makes for a more comfortable tablet aspect ratio, as a laptop screen, the computer can feel top-heavy.<br />- The power cord is proprietary, which is usually not ideal… but it’s a good design. The connector fits snugly into the slots on both the keyboard and tablet using magnets to stay firmly in place (yet detach easily to avoid accidental damage).<br />- The battery life of this computer is good, but not as good as you’d expect it to be for a computer with two batteries. Under normal laptop operation, both the “tablet” and “keyboard” batteries are used equally. But, if you’ve been using JUST the tablet, and then reconnect to the keyboard, the power does draw just from the keyboard-side battery until the two batteries level out, so you won’t end up with funky battery levels.<br /><br />Form Factor<br /><br />- Ports: 2 standard USB ports and an SD card slot on the left, power and one USB-C port (which can be used for video output to an external monitor--HDMI adapter may be needed) on the right. The tablet/monitor has the power button and volume rocker and a headphone jack. When you remove the monitor to use in tablet mode, you can also plug the power cord into just the tablet.<br />- The heat exhaust is located on the top of the keyboard half, right by the ribbed joint where the laptop bends. It’s unobtrusive and honestly, one of the best design ideas I’ve seen on a laptop in a long time! The bottom of the computer doesn’t get hot, and heat is released really efficiently...<br />- ...However, because there are no vents on the bottom, the laptop is absolutely flush with whatever surface it’s sitting on, making it difficult to pick up.<br />- The joint is a little wobbly compared to more traditional laptop joints, but honestly more solid than I expected it to be. The joint makes for a little opening that makes the laptop “bend.” The laptop does still close very securely with a magnet at the outer edge.<br />- The 15in Surface Book 3 is a large computer. It is very light for its size, but it is pretty big. The bend at the joint makes it thicker than it feels like it should be, but also provides kind of a good grip point for carrying. Build is sturdy and solid."
AHZVNDBSVL6BWGT2446JDYEDQUJQ,B08M5N5C5B,5,6,False,"[[VIDEOID:c6bf6b85b14c91ec49bc92707606d9af]] I tested this tablet with three computers: a 2020 M1 Mac Mini, an early 2020 Intel Macbook Air and a ~2012 Lenovo Thinkpad (PC) laptop. My main purpose for using a pen/tablet is remote teaching in video conferencing, so I do a lot of screensharing, drawing on ppts and real-time notes, so I have been using non-screen pen-tablets, including Huion models.<br /><br />When I first hooked up the Kamvas to my daily workhorse, the Mac Mini, I already had the Huion driver installed, because I use a Huion Inspiroy pen tablet with it. I tried hooking up the Kamvas and had nothing but issues. The screen wouldn't detect input no matter what cords I used, and once it finally did (using the 3-in-1 cable), the color was awful.. washed out green... and I was on the verge of returning it. But, I have had compatibility issues with the M1 chip before, so I downloaded the driver onto my Lenovo and tried that one... it worked beautifully using the 3-in-1 cable. So I did some troubleshooting...<br /><br />The conclusion I came to is this: The Kamvas does not like to be confused. If you already have a Huion product, you need to delete all traces of it before hooking up your new Kamvas. Delete the drivers, unhook your old tablet and start with a clean slate. Even if you already have a driver installed, uninstall it and install it again. THEN your new Kamvas will be a happy camper. The quickstart guide says to ""turn off drawing software."" Take this seriously--delete old drivers and if you're having trouble, software conflicts might be the problem.<br /><br />Once I sorted out the driver issue, the Kamvas connected well to my Mac Mini using just the USB-C to USB-C cable as well as to my Macbook Air... neither needed the additional power supply. My Lenovo doesn't have a usb-c port, so I connected using the 3-in-1 cable, and that worked great too. All connections resulted in nice, responsive drawing and writing... but any tablet, drawing software, or multitasking like writing/drawing while conferencing is going to be limited by the power of your computer and GPU. I can conference with this on the Mini and the Lenovo, but the base Intel Macbook Air I've got would probably not do as well under the load.<br /><br />The quirks:<br />- One of the included cords is a usb-c to USB-male power cable, that goes to the outlet connector. The usb-c side of this cable is supposed to fit into the same port as the 3-in-1 cable on the Kamvas. It doesn't really fit. You can jam it in... but then you have a really hard time getting it out. It's way too snug and I hate using brute force on technology. You'd use this cable if you needed a little extra juice on a usb-c connection from your computer. It's not great.<br />- The cables are way too short. You can see this in the picture of the Kamvas connected to my Macbook Air. The Kamvas itself is half the length of the USB-C cable, and if your ports are on the wrong side for your hands, you're gonna have a bad time. Given the power/data requirements, it's inadvisable to use different cables... so you're kind of stuck.<br />- The Kamvas doesn't come with the adjustable stand shown in a lot of the pictures for the product (it's an optional additional accessory), which was sort of disappointing given the size of this tablet and the premium price point. I used a spare laptop stand for mine.<br />- The finishes on the tablet are a bit rough on mine, particularly at the seams. The material is light, but not well machined in multiple places.<br /><br />4.5 stars. Needs much longer cables."
AHZVNDBSVL6BWGT2446JDYEDQUJQ,B08G1FLSL8,4,0,False,"Overall, this is a great alternative to some (MUCH) more expensive tablets out there.<br /><br />I am not an artist, but I teach remotely and wanted a tablet to use for marking up assignments and using a digital whiteboard during streamed classes. I have used Wacom tablets in the past, as well as a couple of other brands. For this tablet, here's the pro/con list:<br /><br />Pros:<br />- came with two pens. That was nice! I like the white one especially--it stands out on my black desk when I'm looking for it in my periphery...<br />- comes with extra nibs.<br />- working drivers (for the most part - see cons). Lets you make some good customizations.<br />- lots of programmable hot""keys"" through the driver software.<br />- The pen works! I've tested it in a couple different platforms for streaming classes: Teams whiteboard, MS Word, Google Jamboard--writes smooth (performance of a pen tablet can also be dependent on the quality of your processor and graphics card).<br /><br />Cons:<br />- outdated connector. This tablet uses a MINI-usb connection. Not a micro-usb or a usb-c. A MINI-usb connection. I got rid of all of those old cables YEARS ago and can't replace this cable right now if it goes bad. This was an unpleasant surprise.<br />- uses up a TON of desk space. While the active space on this tablet is 6x8 in., the whole tablet itself is bigger than a standard sheet of paper. It's huge.<br />- the written instruction card is not well written. If you're familiar with installing and using new hardware and how to install drivers, you'll be fine. If you generally need a lot of guidance, the directions may feel frustrating.<br /><br />Cautions:<br />- I could not get this tablet to work on my 2020 M1 Mac Mini. I was able to install the driver, but the computer/driver would not recognize the tablet and kept saying no tablet was connected. I am not sure if it was a hardware or software issue. The tablet works PERFECTLY on my early 2020 Intel Macbook Air with a USBc-USB dongle (that I already had--there are no dongles included in the box).<br />- The website where you download the drivers is in Chinese language by default. Look for the tiny globe icon at the very top of the page (center-right) to change the language to English. Also, when I tried to install the driver, MacOS didn't want to, saying Apple ""could not check for malicious software."" To override and install, use Finder to find the .dmg file. Right click it to install anyway."
AEP2JQHLKTQ7ZQOGVKEVW6HS3QKA,B00DJCCBXA,3,2,True,"Let me begin by saying a simple purchase should be just that...simple.  This is a basic alarm clock that has terrible instructions.  Pay attention to all the questions posted people...there should not be this much confusion over setting up a simple alarm clock!!!  That being said, I'm struggling through trying to make do as the old one this one replaced makes a buzzing noise that I cannot stand.  It isn't worth sending this one back in my opinion.<br /><br />I feel like I'm a fairly intelligent individual and have had to refer to answers from other users to figure out some options on this alarm clock and by seeing some of the answers, many of the other people who purchased this product aren't sure what some things mean.  My main complaint is the volume option on the alarms.  The lowest level we've been able to find is still way too loud and is a rude awakening.  I am not a morning person and do not need to be abruptly woken up to loud music.  I also don't like an alarm.<br /><br />As mentioned, I'm going to make do with this but would advise other shoppers to pass this one up and keep looking."
AFH7D3PEWHEAN64V5QIQS34FIQVQ,B0044DEDB6,2,6,True,"I ignored the previous review of a Mac user saying this was incompatible because he was running a PowerPC chip...well I'm running an Intel Duo 2.66 GHZ MacBook Pro early 2009, and wanted to use Lightscribe to label my music cds I sell at shows...<br /><br />Just found out that the software CD bundled with this won't read in OSX (I'm running Snow Leopard).  Read other reviews at Newegg and other sites suggesting this isn't even a Lightscribe drive(!).  Works great as a reader/writer, but buyer beware otherwise."
AFD4N6EJ22724FLFZ5FGIJBP6YTQ,B06Y15DWXR,5,2,False,"For: EVGA FTW3 1080ti Graphics Card<br /><br />I just got this card and installed it (replaced an EVGA GTX 1080 blower type) this afternoon.<br /><br />The card aesthetically is very attractive and extremely well engineered. It comes beautifully packaged with all necessary accessories plus some cool stickers, a poster, etc..<br /><br />So the card itself is a thing of beauty and of course not much trouble to install. EVGA provides excellent step by step instructions if you require them.<br /><br />You will be pleasantly surprised if you’re fortunate enough to get you hands on one at a decent price.<br /><br />I would suggest adding your info on EVGA’s website to be “notified” whenever the card is in stock. This is what I did and just a couple short days later received a notification e-mail from EVGA telling me the great news!<br /><br />So I purchased the card directly from EVGA for $880.00 (This isn’t one of the cheaper 1080ti’s but for GOOD reason let me tell you...) I’m totally satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />Benchmarked my new EVGA FTW 3 1080Ti against my EVGA blower type 1080 just to see the what kind of performance gain I was getting.<br /><br />HEAVEN benchmarked @1440p / High /8XAA:<br /><br />EVGA 1080:  90.5 FPS<br />EVGA FTW3 1080Ti  126.7 FPS (+ 36.2)<br /><br />Oh and the TEMPS at 100% sustained are between 15-20degrees C LOWER than my EVGA 1080!<br /><br />So + 36 FPS and -20degrees lower temps vs. the 1080!<br /><br />All this has proven to bare out in all the games I’ve played as well. This is just an outstanding card period.<br /><br />Out of the box my EVGA FTW3 1080Ti clocked at 1999MHZ! However it will not OC much higher (I just set it at 2025MHZ) as it appears pretty much maxed out straight out of the box. No problem seeing how amazing it performs with no tweaking whatsoever.<br /><br />I wasn’t so sure I would get ~ 35% more performance vs. my 1080 as stated by EVGA but as it turns out I am and I couldn’t be more pleased.<br /><br />The set-up I have currently:<br /><br />-Dell 34’ inch Ultra-Wide 3440X1440p  (100HZ / 120HZ OC) G-SYNC monitor<br /><br />-Intel I7 8700K CPU (OC@4.8HZ)<br /><br />-Corsair H100i V2 CPU Water Cooler<br /><br />-EVGA GeForce GTX FTW3 1080ti GPU  (2.0HZ stock boost clock)<br /><br />-EVGA 850W SuperNova G2 Gold rated PSU<br /><br />-Corsair Vengeance RGB 16GB RAM DDR4 3600MHZ<br /><br />-SAMSUNG 850 PRO 1TB SSD (Game Drive)<br /><br />-WD Green 240GB SSD (WIN 10 Boot Drive)<br /> Windows 10 OS<br /><br />*Accessories<br />-Steel Series Arctic 7 wireless Headphones (7.1 surround sound)<br />-Razor BlackWidow Tournament Edition Chroma V2<br />-Razor DeathAdder Elite - Chroma Enabled RGB Ergonomic Gaming Mouse<br />-XBOX One controller<br /><br />I’m seriously in Gaming Nirvana right now. I feel like we’re in something like a “Golden Age” for Gaming currently.<br /><br />Everything I have invested for PC gaming comes out to ~ $4500.00 but I would do it all over again as it is glorious!<br /><br />Lastly, the 1080Ti pairs extremely well with an Ultra-Wide 3440X1440p (100/ 120HZ OC) G-SYNC monitor.<br /><br />Ultra-Wide at this resolution with G-SYNC and 120HZ is much better than the 4K/60HZ I recently came from BTW.<br /><br />With this new FTW3 1080Ti I’m getting amazing frame rates (typically 80-120FPS) on really demanding games such as AC Origins and Shadow of War<br /><br />This on a Dell 34’ inch Ultra-Wide G-SYNC / 120HZ gaming monitor. Absolutely STUNNING!<br /><br />Lately I’m honestly too busy trying to keep my jaw off the floor to really play my games as everything looks and performs so outrageously good!"
AFD4N6EJ22724FLFZ5FGIJBP6YTQ,B0777RY75V,5,172,True,"Okay so this monitor is amazing, honestly not being hyperbolic or anything and I’m coming from a really good 48’ inch 4K (60Hz) Samsung TV.<br /><br />For some perspective I’m hooked up to this monitor with the following:<br /><br />Intel I7-8700K (OC@4.8GHZ)<br />EVGA GTX 1080 (OC@2.1GHZ) - EVGA FTW3 1080ti in-coming T- 2 days... :)<br />16GB Corsair Vengeance DDR4 3600MHZ<br />Corsair H100i V2 CPU Water Cooler<br />1TB Samsung 850 Pro SSD<br />850W EVGA SuperNova G2 Gold PSU<br />And so on....<br /><br />So currently the weakest part in my system is the GTX 1080 (not that its weak its not) but regardless I’m able to throughly enjoy this gaming monitor at the either the highest or very close to the highest graphics settings @3440X1440P with frames rates generally ranging from 80-120.<br /><br />Destiny 2 for example, at 3440X1440P with nearly everything maxed I’m averaging around 80-90FPS and it is GLORIOUS!<br /><br />DOOM - Maxed out graphics 3440X1440P @ mostly a locked 120FPS. Its just phenomenal!<br /><br />AC Origins - High / Very High graphics 3440X1440P @70-100 FPS and Holly #%*& over is this game jaw dropping gorgeous!!<br /><br />Just Cause 3 - Nearly Maxed graphics at 3440X1440P generally 70-90FPS. This is another exceptionally gorgeous game!<br /><br />Overwatch - MAX graphics 3440-1440P @ generally 80-120FPS. Again gorgeous and absolutely phenomenal performance.<br /><br />So hopefully this gives a decent idea of what is required to take best advantage of this flat out AWESOME  Ultra-Wide gaming monitor from Dell.<br /><br />The GTX 1080 is perfectly adequate. The only reason I ordered a 1080ti is due to being notified by EVGA that it was on sell at regular price (I signed up to be notified for when / if)<br /><br />No, the GTX 1080 wont get you 120FPS at Max graphics every game but it regardless is certainly powerful enough to justify this monitor.<br /><br />Also, you can always adjust the settings a bit to get higher FPS. Still I personally wouldn’t go any lower than a GTX 1070 with this monitor.<br /><br />Lastly, the build quality and esthetics of the monitor is a solid 10/10 absolutely top notch and could not be more pleased.<br /><br />I snagged this bad boy up for $999.99 when the price dropped recently (and rather briefly) but honestly had I paid $1500.00 I would still feel like I made out well. Its really that good.<br /><br />*Update<br /><br />Replaced my EVGA GTX 1080 (blower type) with an EVGA GTX FTW3 1080TI.<br /><br />The 1080 I would say was certainly adequate for this monitor but now with the 1080TI it is simply almost unbelievably great.<br /><br />Not only have my temps remained ~ 15-20C lower under 100% sustained load (about 55-60C vs. 70-75) but I’m getting ~ 30-35+ FPS!<br /><br />So instead requiring to adjust the settings down to high / very high I’m now at “Ultra” with higher frame rates to boot :)<br /><br />More impressively however IMO is the lower sustained temperatures which allow gaming at a higher level for MUCH MUCH longer and without the worry you’re going to degrade your equipment = Piece Of Mind!<br /><br />Lastly, BLB (AKA: Back Light Bleed) is there but it is very minimal and relegated to the outer four corners of the monitor. It is a complete “non-issue” yet I’m certain a minority of ultra anal-retentive folk would be “dissapointed”<br /><br />Anyways, flat out amazing monitor. Works wonderful with GTX 1080 and especially so with a GTX 1080TI."

I was up vccffrand running Windows 10 within a few minutes of delivery.<br /><br />I have this PC hooked up to my 48’ Samsung  KU7500 series 4K TV (Really good TV for gaming BTW) - HDMI 2.0 cable connected to HDMI port 2 / HDMI UHD Color: ON (4:4:4)<br /><br />GAMING:<br />Destiny 2 runs beautifully at 2160p (4K) / 60 FPS on this rig on default settings. You do NOT need a 1080 Ti to run Destiny 2 at 2160p (4K) / 60 FPS the GTX 1080 is sufficient.<br /><br />Overwatch of course runs maxed out at 2160p (4K) / 60 FPS (my TV is 60HZ)<br /><br />Skyrim same story gorgeous at 4K / 60 FPS.<br /><br />Also tried Ghost Recon Wild lands. This game is a beast on your GPU.. This one would not run 4K / 60 FPS (I doubt a 1080 Ti could for that matter) However it was great at Very High preset 1440p / 60 FPS.<br /><br />Very much pleased by the performance of this PC. I do think this combination of I7 8700K / GTX 1080 should be capable of running most games at 4K / 60 FPS or 1440p / 60 FPS +.<br /><br />All games at 4K / 60 FPS “Max” settings? No but with a little bit of adjusting the settings back to very high / high and if required &#34;medium&#34; (I know God forbid..) you still end up with an experience that looks and plays phenomenally.<br /><br />Honestly “Ultra” settings are so over-rated. You really can set the graphics settings slightly down to very high / high and even med in some cases and it looks just as good / just about as good or to a point the difference is negligible.<br /><br />The only notable difference is that you gain a TON  of performance / FPS. - “Ultra” is there to get naive people to spend money on things they don’t need. This is why you don’t need a 1080 ti to play most AAA games at 4K/ 60 FPS, the GTX 1080 is enough for the most part.<br /><br />Anyway, rather you get one of these CyberPower PC’s with an I5 / RX580 / GTX 1060 or a fully maxed I7 / 1080 Ti I’m sure you will be very pleased with you systems performance. These folks obviously know what they're doing and they layout chosen makes it really easy for future upgrades.<br /><br />The RX 580 / GTX 1060 PC’s will dominate any AAA game at 1080p / 60FPS+<br /><br /> *MUCH better deal than spending $500 + online subscription on a mostly 4K / 30FPS machine like the XBOX X BTW. (1080p / 60FPS &#62; 4K / 30FPS)<br /><br />The GTX 1070 PC’s will dominate most AAA games at 1440p / 60FPS+<br /><br />The GTX 1080 PC’s will crush most AAA games at 1440p / 60FPS+ as well as play most AAA games at 4K/60FPS (some graphics adjusting my be required)<br /><br />The very top of the line max daddy GTX 1080 Ti PC’s of course well play the vast majority of current AAA games at 4K / 60FPS at the highest settings.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />After many hours of Destiny 2 I’ve settled on resolution of ~ 1800p for Destiny 2 which is achieved by rendering 2160p down to 83% in the video options menu.<br /><br />2160p (4K) was staple @ 60 FPS for 99.9% of the time during my time playing the campaign. It was playing “strikes” however when I noted the FPS wasn’t sufficiently holding 60 FPS.<br /><br />The good news is that rendering the game down to ~ 1800p (2160P rendered at 83%) has not in any meaningful way downgraded my experience playing the game (unless perhaps if I zoomed in frame by frame and deeply analyzed could I actually see a difference...) and I’m now locked at 60 FPS (could be a bit more but again my TV is 60Hz)<br /><br />1800p is actually a nice bump up from 1440p (You can see the difference here although the game still looks and plays great at 1440p or even 1080p for that matter)<br /><br />I end by hoping more games will come out supporting the sort of video rendering options offered in Destiny 2.<br /><br />This option to “downscale” if you will a 2160p resolution to a degree more suitable to your hardware allows for much better flexibility and helps maximize the true potential of your particular machine vs. the standard: 1080p / 1440p / 2160p settings offered by most current games.<br /><br />*UPDATE (12-23-17)<br /><br />Installed: EVGA SuperNOVA 850 G2, 80+ GOLD 850W, Fully Modular PSU, Corsair Hydro Series, H100i v2 CPU cooler and finally a Samsung 850 PRO - 1TB - 2.5-Inch SATA III Internal SSD.

It appeared to be sufficient until I decided to overclock the GTX 1080 video card (1911 MHz stock clock boosted to 2100 MHz ; memory clock boosted from 5000 to 5500 MHz via MSI Afterburner.)<br /><br />I knew the stock 600 watt PSU was no longer adequate when I would suffer major performance clinches within an hour of game play and being booted out of game for no apparent reason (other than not enough power..)<br /><br />The good news is that all my troubles where solved (and my marriage saved) by replacing the stock 600 watt unit with a new EVGA SuperNOVA G2, 80+ GOLD rated 850 watts PSU.<br /><br />The install wasn’t difficult, it took me around 30-45 minutes only because this was my first time doing this and I was taking my time. Just make sure you detach the back side of the case for easy access to the PSU.<br /><br />I’m sure 850 watts is a bit “overkill” but its nice to have some breathing room for peace of mind / future upgrades. I would suggest however replacing the stock 600 watt PSU with something rated at least 700 watts and with at least a bronze rating.<br /><br />You can get a good 700 watt PSU for under $100.00 easy and it would be well worth the investment. Replacing the PSU will not only ensure enough power to overclock, upgrade, etc but it should also be more energy efficient.<br /><br />I was happy to see that my CPU (I7 8700K) came with an air cooler that was obviously more substantial than a stock Intel cooler. To be clear it was perfectly adequate at stock settings and probably would be okay for a slight overclock (given optimal fan controller settings)<br /><br />Since I do plan to overclock my CPU by more than just a tad however I installed a Corsair Hydro Series, H100i v2 CPU cooler.<br /><br />This was my very first time installing a CPU cooler so I wasn’t in a hurry and completed everything in about an hour or so (could be done in 10-20 minutes I’m sure).<br /><br />Once you have it hooked up the way you want in your case you can monitor, modify and view your stats (CPU / GPU / HDD/ SDD temps, fan / pump rpms, etc.) You can also set the cooler to perform at either: Quiet, Balanced or Performance mode.<br /><br />The only “benchmarking” I’ve done to date has been playing games. I’ve noticed a drop of approximately 10-15 degrees celsius  compared to air cooling. This is certainly substantial but there is obviously more to it than that (performance over a prolonged period of time and so on..)<br /><br />Now to be clear the fact that I’ve felt the need to spend more money replacing / adding stuff to this PC doesn’t mean I think it’s a “bad deal” or anything.<br /><br />In fact I still believe it was a very good deal considering all you get. A gaming PC with an I7 8700K, GTX 1080, 16GB DDR4, 240GB SSD, 2TB HDD, etc.. for $1529.00 is not a bad deal in the least.<br /><br />Like with practically anything, there are almost always ways to improve things. One of the great things about this PC is how upgradable and accommodating it is. It’s just a really nice, flexible platform to begin with.<br /><br />*Update (01/12/18)<br /><br />Everything is still running great and still super happy with the PC.<br /><br />I'm posting now however to let people know that they should go to MSI website to update their Mother Boards if they haven't already. I personally thought the &#34;updates&#34; were done automatically but I was wrong... So yeah make sure you do this as you'll get all kinds of really nice updates / upgrades for your MB concerning overclocking, customization, monitoring, etc.. More importantly even the updates may very well help solve issues you may have been having."

I have owned a number of Creative sound cards including the original sound blaster card up through the XFI series. I am familiar with the SB driver funkiness.

Shut down, kill power, restart, shut down, kill power reseat card, power up, same thing. By all indications, the card should be putting out sound. Windows thinks it is working, but no output.

AEJCMKNP3BAEIZVY5YTCESFO7RJA,B00AWVXK5O,1,62,True,"This review is regarding solely shipping and customer service issues with Amazon, for the Kindle Paperwhite. I say this so as not to receive unhelpful remarks about the product itself (which I have yet to even enjoy) - but to educate potential Amazon buyers of getting their Kindle Paperwhite through Amazon. Seriously - buyers beware.<br /><br />1st Kindle Paperwhite: Received as Christmas present from husband. Paperwhite was in it's sleek black box, packaged with another Kindle and various books in a typical Amazon cardboard box. Opened Paperwhite item to discover scratch on lower left hand screen. Amazon insisted on registering item before Return process - due to 'holiday shipping issues' replacement would not be overnight.<br /><br />2nd Kindle Paperwhite: 12/31/2013 - (photo on item page) Opened typical Amazon cardboard box to discover a Kindle Paperwhite and it's cord floating at the bottom of the box between 3 bubble inserts. NO black box......  Was it refurbished? Why was it out of the black box sliding around the bottom of cardboard? Called Amazon - was assured it was a brand new Kindle Paperwhite. Which begs the question: Why is it out of it's secure black box then?? They have no clue. Amazon admitted shipping idiocy and processed another return for replacement. Oh - BTW I was reminded at this point that my husband's purchase date of 12/10 still stands as the 30 day warranty marker - since the 1st Kindle had been registered before return process (at THEIR suggestion) Nice catch huh?<br /><br />3rd Kindle Paperwhite: 1/3/2014 - (photo on item page) Kindle Paperwhite Black box with USPS label slapped on the side sitting on my damp front door step. No Amazon cardboard box or safe packaging...... Just a Kindle screaming ""steal me, please."" WOW. Called Amazon, and the shipping Customer Service manager assured me that that is how ALL KINDLES are being shipped. Hmmmm, funny as that's not how the first or second one was. I asked the manager to explain to me the difference between this nonsense and having an XBox 360 container, plain as day sitting on a doorstep with a UPS label on it?......... crickets.....The manager seemed frustrated with me and said she ""could not guarantee how the 4th replacement would be packaged or shipped..... but I have 5 more business days until my warranty for a 'non-refurbished' replacement is up."" How is this even fair?<br /><br />So I asked..... can I purchase a Kindle Paperwhite with ads at my local Best Buy and just call Amazon to pay for the ads to be removed? She said 'Yes.' So my final response was - then send me a return label & refund my husband immediately, as Amazon cannot intelligently package anything valuable to save their soul.<br /><br />*Final slap in the face: My in-law had his Amazon purchased Paperwhite returned for replacement on 12/26 as well due to dead pixels on his screen. He still has not received his replacement due to Amazon choosing Fed-Ex as his delivery method, and Fed-Ex refusing to deliver to his PO Box - which is all he has. Classy :)"

AFIMCF2IJCFJOY6XUDXAH6YFINBQ,B01MTO7P8X,2,46,True,"I compared this very nice looking radio to a Sangean ATS-909, a Sangean ATS-909x, a Tecsun PL-660 and a CCrane Skywave.  All four of those have straightforward operation and good performance.<br /><br />On the air band on the Eton I could not pick up my local airport automated weather at 118.525 MHz.  The Skywave picks it up weakly but intelligibly.  The Tecsun also does not pick it up.  The Sangeans do not have an air band.<br /><br />FM reception is good but the procedure to get stations into memory using the ATS is rather convoluted especially when compared to the ease of it in the other 4 radios.  ATS for the Eton works ONLY on the FM band.  In fairness, the Sangeans do not have ATS for the SW bands, only for their other bands.<br /><br />Just quickly checking the reception of a few daytime AM BCB and SW stations I did not note any deficiencies, but also nothing that stood out on the good side for the Eton.  Operation-wise, often my button presses did not register the first time.  The print on the buttons is tiny, and the build quality and operation of the buttons seems subpar compared to the other radios.<br /><br />Because I like to tune through the bands like in the &#34;old days&#34;, I was also disappointed with the tuning &#34;chuffing&#34; sound as you switch from one frequency to another, either 1 kHz at a time or the 5Khz spacing.  The Skywave also has this problem, but my Sangeans and the Tecsun do not, or the chuffing noise is at such low levels it's unnoticeable.  I know I had an anti-chuffing mod done to the 909, I think I had it done also to the 909x, and the Tecsun is completely stock.  It's a pleasure to be able to tune through a band without the chuffing!  I don't know why this &#34;feature&#34; of soft muting was ever implemented, but it is very annoying.<br /><br />The display, unless it's lit up, is hard to see outside in the daylight in the shade.  It's cloudy here today so I did not get a chance to see how it looks in the sunlight.<br /><br />I don't usually worry about populating and retrieving stations from memories but in the manual for the Eton, it also seems more complex and less straightforward than with the other radios.  By this time after 15-20 minutes or so I'd already decided to return it so I did not actually go through storing and retrieving stations from memory.<br /><br />My general impression is that everything is needlessly more complex and not as straightforward as it is on the other 4 radios I compared it with - and for no good reasons that I can tell.<br /><br />That the nice case it comes with makes the radio unusable when its front cover is over the front of the radio, seems a real design waste.<br /><br />But one good thing - the Eton has made me appreciate the other radios more than I did before!  So, back it goes.  Thanks to Amazon for making the return easy."
AEQOC7UMJIOPLIZWGUOAXBDDEOKQ,B004KKZ0KG,1,2,False,"First off, let me start by saying, I know my way around electronics, I have a degree in electronics for Pete's sake. So I'd like to think, a little thing such as a compact camera won't bring me down! HOWEVER, this camera, was 100% overly complicated.<br />I had it for a week, read the book, cover to cover, and it was still too complicated. There were features this camera had on it's screen that weren't even discussed in the book. I got it to 'Ia' (intelligent auto) and could never get it back out of that, even after telling it to re-do all settings back to factory. You can't just change the settings on the fly. I was shooting in the bright sunlight, with snow.. and it was having a difficult time finding what to focus on. I could have probably changed the settings, but who has 20 minutes to go through the entire menu!<br />There were a billion different features, that just werent needed, which took away the ease of point and shoot. The GPS feature was never right, even when I told it to go out and look for location again. It kept saying  ""location failed"".. i'ts a super heavy camera, so good luck finding a floatie strap to keep it from sinking.<br />We have a Lumix regular camera, and the quality is superb, this one however, lacked that crisp sharp picture. This camera was a replacement for my Olympus tough that we'd had for several years(also waterproof, shock and freeze proof) I was looking for better quality underwater photos, and thought since our regular (Lumix) point and shoot camera is awesome, I'd go ahead and pay the high price and get a lumix for underwater, thinking, it would be worth the $$ for the lovely photos. Nope, not even close to the same quality.<br />Now, here are a few more weird things. Each time you turn the camera on, it reminds you to check the door, makes sure to have you check that nothing is stuck in there. The entire book is a testament to WHAT NOT TO DO, with way of the sand, or water, and how to lock the door.. its even got its own little brush you are to bring with to sweep the door and seals!!<br />The book also tells you that after one year, you need to replace the seals. (read somewhere they are at least $60) If you are in the water more than 60 minutes, it's underwater functions are no longer guaranteed, you are to take it out of the water, then within 60 minutes of coming out it has to be submerged in tap water, for at least 10 minutes. What type of person, buys a tough, freeze proof, water proof camera, and has this kind of time while on vacation? Oh gosh, I have to hurry out of the water, and hurry to someplace where I can submerge the camera for 10 minutes in tap water?! I don't know about you, but if I'm on vacation, I don't want to worry about how many minutes I am in the water, or how long its been since I submerged my camera, or where in the world the silly brush is to clean out my seals!! My Olympus which I had for years, never gave me any trouble, and I can assure you, it was in the water for more than 60 minutes, and never rinsed, brushed or submerged in tapwater!<br />I bought the olympus tough once again instead, I should have known better. Why fix something that's not broken, and its by FAR easier and more user friendly to work.<br />Returned this one today, and bought my trusty, easy to use, takes great pictures, light, Olympus tough 14 mp.<br />Sorry Panasonic, you failed on this one."

AESQN7YFFW5N3TIR2XIM7NSCPHGQ,B00IKTSSIO,4,28,False,"I am replacing an aging 17TB WHS11 Home server that has served me well over the years with this DS415+. It really has been my first foray into a Linux environment other than basic commands and plenty experience with Android, so for me there was a bit of a learning curve. I put in 3 - 5TB WD Red drives using Synology's SHR raid, and compared to my home built WHS with Green drives, this thing screams. My particular WHS uses disk duplication so only 8.5TB is available out of the 17TB (think RAID1, which allows me some growing to do if I add another 5TB red.<br /><br />The unit's interface is quick and responsive. The files are available in a lightning quick fashion giving me access to everything I need right away. As I stated before, my experiences were with Windows in the past and I am astounded at the performance of this small device with the small overhead of Linux. It is silent, small, and fast. What more can you ask for?<br /><br />As good as this is with serving files out to multiple environments, I was really interested in the mobile apps that they provide.<br /><br />DSCloud- Prior to purchasing this, my Dropbox account was set to expire and I really wanted to utilize my own server as a personal cloud. The promise of this is mostly delivered in this product, so far it is delivering and syncing files with all my android devices (Note 8, Note 4, and Note 10) and PC's within the LAN, but right now it appears to have an issue with proxies that my company provided laptop requires. I am assuming that it will be resolved soon and will eventually finalize my last requirement.<br />Regarding my desire to replace Dropbox on my android devices: I have 64gb and 128gb microsd cards in all my Note products. In order to have a copy of my files always available and synced, I have to also use Dropsync pro to sync up my files to have them locally on the Android tablets. This is a requirement for me which the DSCloud app does provide so far. Rating C+ (once the proxy fix is in then it will jump to a solid A, that is a huge problem)<br /><br />DSNote- As stated above, I have Samsung Note products and the Snote apps can't be beat by anyone when it comes to features, however they maintain different versions across the same manufactures platforms. This creates a problem with compatibility when opening and closing notes regularly in the different devices. I then began to use Evernote and Onenote which are both nicely done packages that have the same revision across all platforms. The both offer S-Pen support and while Evernote has more features available, they use a mix of different programs (Skitch) to accomplish the tasks and requires a fee to have these notes available offline. Onenote is plain, it does the job, is free and can provide my notes locally without a fee. If you have ever used Onenote on android in the past, you can likely consider DSNote to be a similar product without the SPen support. If they integrate handwriting, this would be the perfect product for me. Rating B-<br /><br />DSVideo- All of my movies are ripped in an MP4 format, mostly without subtitles (Which requires transcoding to occur) in 720P being fed to Roku devices. The DS415+ doesn't even stir when I ask for these files, add in higher resolution, some subtitles and poor formatting and it still does the job, but places too much load onto the cpu and stutters the frames. It really is about using a properly formatted video container in order for DSVideo to work smoothly. Plex is not supported at this time, but can be installed by editing the arch line in the INFO file to add the Avoton CPU. It is not going to be like WHS and transcode on the fly for you to multiple streams, but it can do a limited job. I personally am ensuring a proper format for my videos, using DS video and will continue this path OR will put an intel Nuc or similar in my rooms that matter. rating B+<br /><br />DSCam- I have 3- 9831p Foscam cameras and have used many different software packages to monitor these while away. I can say that there are many packages out there that can do anything but appear like an aged product, and others that can only do certain aspects. The main thing for me was the need for alarm event recording all the time and be able to manage its storage to only use so much space and then record over the oldest recording. The Surveillance Station app in the DS415+ is a robust, clean, and intuitive program that does everything I want, with one small issue. The Foscam apps deliver smooth stutter free 960p video no matter what the frame rate and bit rate is set to, but on the SS program, the images are clear and accurate but they slightly stutter like it's running 10fps. I mean really, after spending many days trying to find the right program for recording, with all the aspects that I need, it's not like I am watching a movie and need perfection. I am trusting that it will get better and it does the job perfectly in all other aspects. The stutter is simply an inconvenience during live view, but it appears to record slightly better. The DSCam app is as clean as any other mobile app out there, provides multiple display options and you can look at your recordings as well. Rating a solid A product for me.<br /><br />Other aspects- Quickconnect is great if you don't care to forward ports on your router, and the interface is clean, understandable and effective. Permissions to user rights and privileges are different than on Windows platforms, but can be worked out much more easily once you know where to go. Overall rating B+<br /><br />Overall, just scratching the surface of the product, I am very happy with the device and is meeting all of my expectations and exceeding them in many, there are absolutely some areas that it can improve upon and once the proxy issue is resolved, I would say that it would be an A product across the board. (Add in Spen support in DS note and it becomes an A+)"

With the remote it is very easy to switch between the two and I am able to keep the KVM switch and the cables out of the way. My secondary monitor is also plugged into both computers but getting a KVM switch that can handle dual monitors was pricey. Instead I manually switch the source if I need to. It has a source button on the front so it's easy to do. If both of your monitors have the source setting buried in a menu then you might want to consider a dual monitor capable KVM switch.<br />I am glad I bought this because for the price it is a great convenience. The switch is quick and it just takes a second for the computer to recognize the devices again.<br />A couple of notes:<br />1) the cable lengths will be fine for most people but before I got the docking station I had the cables plugged directly into the laptop. On one side I was able to plug in the VGA and one USB but since there is only one USB port on that side of the laptop I had to plug the other one in on the other side. The cable was not quite long enough. Thankfully I had a USB extension cable on hand. Something to consider if your ports are far apart.<br />2) At first I could not get the laptop to set the monitor to the correct resolution.  It is 22&#34; with a resolution of 1680 x 1050. When plugged directly into the laptop it was okay and when plugged into the KVM switch and using my desktop it was fine. But when switched to my laptop through the KVM switch it would not even list the correct resolution as an option. There were only three options and none correct leaving the image looking skewed and fuzzy. After adding and removing the monitor several times and playing with the settings, I found Custom Resolution under Advanced Mode in the Intel graphics control panel and I was able to add the correct options.  With the docking station the long list of resolutions is back and it automatically selects the right one.<br />My set up: Dual 22&#34; monitors @ 1680x1050, Logitech MX310 mouse, Saitek Eclipse II keyboard, Windows 7 Pro desktop with Asus Z77 motherboard, Dell Latitude E6420 notebook with Windows 7 Enterprise. First monitor connected to the KVM switch. Second monitor directly connected to the docking station with DVI-D and to the desktop using VGA cable and VGA to DP adapter."
AE2J7XLQ4H2YREBG3KFJFWJDJWHQ,B00N2RNT5Q,3,1,True,"I built a new computer for my parents and since they do not need a high end board I thought this B85-based one would do just fine.  I've always had good luck with MSI boards and thought the Eco feature would be nice to have.  The layout of the board is decent and it is supposed to be a high quality, reliable board.<br /><br />I did run into two issues though.  One is that the computer took forever to reboot and then it started to boot loop repeatedly.  I resolved the issue by moving the SSD from SATA1 to SATA2.  I also swapped out the SATA cable for the other one (two were supplied with the board) so I don't know if MSI supplied a bad cable or there is something wrong with SATA1.  The DVD drive is plugged into SATA3 using the cable that came with the drive and is working okay.<br /><br />The other problem I had was with the eco feature.  Every time I tried to open the eco software it would crash so that was worthless.  I also tried setting it up in the BIOS but it would ignore what I selected.  For example, if I told it to leave the power LED on it would still turn it off.  I knew having the power LED off would confuse my parents and I didn't have time to keep messing with it so I ended up leaving the eco feature off.<br /><br />On the plus side, the computer is fast and stable, the board recognized the memory without issue and the BIOS is easy to use.  I also like the color scheme of the board.<br /><br />About the build:<br />CPU: Intel Core i3-4160; RAM: G.SKILL Value 8GB DDR3 1600; MB: MSI B85M Eco; SSD: Samsung 850 EVO 250GB with Rosewill RDRD-11003 mounting kit (fan removed); OS: Win7 Home Premium SP1 64-bit; PSU: Rosewill ARC-450W; OD: Samsung DVD-RW SH-224FB/RSBS; Fans: Antec TriCool 3-speed; Case: Apex SQ-328 (reused)"
AH5V4GHCU2XWJ36IGXMZYAM4KLNA,B004NPMZOW,5,1,True,"From the beginning I had issues with this cable.<br />When I finally got it inserted into the Intel card (very difficult--like it was over-size), I didn't get a link state light on the switch.<br />Three withdrawals and insertions finally made everything work.  Although it will go in about a mm after it clicks, it pulls back that much.  I don't know if this is part of the issues it has or not.<br /><br />After teaming my NIC with another one, things didn't really pick up any better than a CAT 6 cable had; in fact, it deteriorated after a day.<br /><br />Using the built in cable test from Intel, the cable tested good for polarity, etc.  However, it showed a problem at 21-meters away.  Longer than the 25-ft cable.  And the patch cord from the switch is only 3 feet.  I suspected the switch at first, but that throughput, etc. tested fine.  So, I swapped cable ends.<br /><br />Now the same test showed a poor connection at 1 meter.<br /><br />My guess would be a kink inside the cable, although the outside shows no sign of that.<br /><br />UPDATE: 03/04/2014--Cable Matters contacted me and offered to send both a replacement and a return shipping label for the bad one.  A couple of days later I got an e-mail that THEY were out of stock but had directed Amazon to replace it directly. The new one arrived and the problems are gone. And, the connectors are better!!

AEBXDYONTMLLZYJGQIKWRL4BYPGA,B00Q2Z11QE,5,15,True,"I needed a case for my file server that could fit more hard drives without being massive. I read a few reviews and one mentioned this case. I bought one and I love it so far after installing everything and using it for a week.<br /><br />Things I like about this case:<br /><br />* Eight 3.5"" drive bays<br />* Two 2.5"" SSD mounts - fairly standard for a case this size<br />* Plenty of fan mounts - two in front, one in back, 0-3 on top (remove plates to mount fans) and even one on the size.<br />* Fit and finish is good. No sharp edges. Everything seems to fit together snugly. No twisting or other movement in the case.<br />* Cable management is good for a mid-tower. As you can see in the picture, I can fit ten SATA data cables behind the motherboard/drive cage area, along with three SATA power cables.<br /><br />I really cannot think of anything bad about the case, but I want to stress that I am using it as a file server. I don't even have a GPU in mine, using the built-in Intel graphics for the rare time I log in to the Ubuntu desktop as opposed to ssh. If you have a long GPU you may need to remove one of the 3.5"" drive cages. Speaking of which: there are three drive cages including the 5.25"" one. All can be removed, and the 3.5"" can be rearranged different ways. This way if you don't need 3.5"" drives you could put an AIO or water cooler in their place."
AEBXDYONTMLLZYJGQIKWRL4BYPGA,B002RWJGI6,5,0,True,"Stock Intel coolers are awful. They have plastic pieces that expand and hold the cooler in place.

That plate is plastic, with a metal X that goes around the screw holes. Once attached this thing is nice and secure, unlike the stock Intel coolers. The metal of the heat sink, screws, and back plate are all connected and provide a firm hold.<br /><br />I do not overclock so I cannot speak to its ability to handle extra heat, but so far it handles stock speeds on two of my systems just fine."

AH74MHABHO4LZQVIS5CLATHGOMSA,B002XZM0HQ,5,0,True,I've used the AMD and Intel 101 and 212 before and they work well in every build I've put them in. I originally bought this for an Intel build which didn't end up happening and when I contacted Cooler Master to buy the brackets for AMD they sent them to me for no charge.
AHQOX7MBKNXIU6UGCFKOA5TUSLQA,B00OAJ412U,5,2,False,"My system specs: AMD Phenom II N830 (roughly comparable to a higher end Intel i3), 8GB RAM, Windows 7 64-bit, 256MB Radeon 4250<br /><br />I debated for weeks between this Samsung 850 EVO and the Crucial MX200. Both had similar performance. The Crucial has the time-tested MLC NAND going for it, whereas the Samsung has the new 3D TLC V-NAND. The 840 EVO model proved a failure due to inherent design issues of non-V TLC NAND. Supposedly the 850 EVO does not suffer the same issue.<br /><br />What finally won me over was the included software. While unnecessary, the included software is a nice feature. I'm not talking about the cloning software, but the SSD management tool. The Crucial software is over 150MB download whereas the Samsung is a mere 17MB. The Crucial relies upon ( an older version) Javascript, which makes up for most of the 150MB. Overall the Crucial software sounds less refined, more hodge-podged together and the Samsung software is more well-thought out. Now having installed and used the Samsung Magician (v4.7 as of this review), I say it works well. And I like that it is not a bloated piece of useless junk, or at least not bloated. Something that was only 4 or 5MB would have been even better, but now I'm splitting hairs.<br /><br />I'd also be lying if I also didn't say that price was a factor. The price of the 850 EVO has in recent months become very competitive. I was also glad to have waffled and researched for a while, because in doing so I came upon a nice coupon code for another electronics retailer (one that doesn't have old things that come from chickens). I was set to purchase from Amazon, but since AZ and the other retailer have similar return policies, I went with the other retailer due to the coupon code I found in an online forum (I think it was the overclockers forum).<br /><br />I used Macrium Reflect Free to clone the HDD to the 850 EVO, and it worked flawlessly. It took about 3 hours to clone 110GB on my laptop. I used a SATA2 external USB enclosure on my USB 2.0 system. I had actually installed the Samsung cloning software and was all set to do so, but was concerned about the message it gave that &#34;any open files cannot be cloned&#34;. I had never seen this before in a cloning software, afterall, how would it clone the operating system, since all those files are open? Anyways, that message made me not trust the Samsung software, so I used Macrium Reflect instead. Macrium also gave me options as to which partitions I wanted to copy (including hidden ones), whereas the Samsung software did not. I have read many reviews of the Samsung software not working for folks, but not one yet that Macrium did not. Macrium also is engineered to recognize and work with SSD's and it ran the TRIM command after cloning, which is necessary for a healthy SSD.<br /><br />The first boot up to Windows 7 with the new 850 EVO had me slightly concerned. It booted quickly to the &#34;Welcome&#34; screen and then the cursor spun its circle for way too long, in my opinion. Finally the Windows desktop showed, then I saw two bubble messages on the system tray saying something about installing device drivers for the 850 EVO and it asked me to restart the system. When I restarted the system this time, it booted very quickly to the desktop. I didn't time it, but the computer was certainly ready to use in perhaps a third of the time. My guess it that it previously took about 60 seconds for the desktop to appear and the HDD to be quiet enough to actually start using the computer...now it is about 20 seconds. I'm very happy about that.<br /><br />It's only been a few hours since the install, but so far, I am very impressed. My laptop only has SATA2, so it can't take full advantage of the SSD's speed potential, but it doesn't matter much to me, compared to a spinning HDD. Programs open almost instantly. I am not a super power user. My daily programs tend to use Firefox, Quickbooks 2012 and perhaps iTunes. Itunes is a huge program that always bogs my computer down when I start it, but not now, it takes about 5 seconds to load, with no bog down. Quickbooks is similar. I don't play video games. All I really wanted was a snappy computer that didn't get bogged down by a HDD. Nothing is more annoying that not being able to use the computer because the HDD is slowing everything down. That should ever happen again with the SSD.<br /><br />My fears about the TLC NAND in the 850 EVO have been pretty well laid to rest. Plenty of well-written reviews as well as smart folks in online forums have convinced me that the 850 EVO will not suffer the slow read results of old files that the 840 EVO suffered. While both models use TLC NAND, the 3D V-NAND version of TLC NAND of the 850 EVO is supposedly different enough that it is impossible to have the same problem as the 840 EVO. While I find it concerning that Samsung released the 840 EVO with such a grave design error, I find it very hard to believe they would make the same mistake twice in a row. I'll update this review in the coming months and years to see if this turns out to be the case.<br /><br />Final suggestions if you are considering this for your first SSD for your laptop:<br /><br />* Move little used large files off the HDD you intend to clone onto another HDD or other storage (don't max out the capacity of your SSD, it will dramatically slow it down.)<br />* If you want more storage, consider removing your optical drive and getting a HDD caddy that goes where the optical drive was and install your HDD there.<br />* Samsung's suggestion for page file size is comparable to what I researched. I have the C: drive page file set to 16 - 2048MB. If you do tip #2 and put your HDD in the optical drive bay, you could make the C: drive page file even smaller and add a second larger file on the HDD. On my system with 8GB RAM, it doesn't use the page file as often as when I had only 4GB, even when I only had the HDD.<br />* Research has suggested that for my typical non-power usage, using the SSD for page file, hibernation and other daily large writing processes will not bring my SSD to a premature end. I should easily get 5-10 years out of this drive and by then SSD and/or bus transfer technology will have advanced so far, I'll want a new one!<br />* The RAPID mode of the 850 EVO has mixed reviews. Some say it is joke and tricks benchmarks, some say it works and some say it adds a risk to losing data that might not get written to the SSD if you suddenly lose power. Probably not going to happen since my laptop has a battery, but I am going to play it safe. For now, I am leaving it turned off, as it doesn't seem worth the risk of data loss. It's already plenty fast for me."

AGUABFBCTCBFNUGNFQ5UXSUATE2Q,B00MUTWELC,5,4,True,"I just finished another brand new personal build that I swapped my old system's cpu out for (an FX 4350) until this one came and it's a very noticeable step up from a 4 core to an 8 core. It's also blazing fast!

It comes out of the box at 4.0Ghz and turbos up to 4.2Ghz stable. You can get more, but that requires some Bios OC tweaking and some lengthy stability tests. All in all, I'm glad I made the switch to this 8 core speed demon. Everything that I've thrown at it so far, Prime 95, Futuremark, Cinebench, it's attacked it with zeal.

The trackpad is huge! Very wide profile allows for lots of freedom when using it. Palm rejection has worked just fine. The webcam is okay. Good luck finding a great webcam on any laptop today.<br /><br />Now, this laptop isn't perfect. I do have a few gripes.<br /><br />First, no backlit keyboard. Not a dealbreaker, but it is a nice feature to have. Next, there is an intel graphics setting that is on by default that changes the screen brightness depending on the content of the screen. (think dynamic brightness on TVs) It's super annoying, but thankfully can be toggled off in the intel graphics settings. And lastly, the LED lights on the body right under the screen are bright as the sun and might bug some people in the dark. I have not found a way to turn them off in the software.<br /><br />Overall a great device though. It's a very good looking device that turns heads in public. People can't believe how thin it is.

AHIE7ZMB5EIRC6HHSSSWHBTQI2ZA,B07G9RWBZC,3,5,False,"Update: I genuinely love this watch as its designed, but unfortunately, after less than two weeks of wear, I began encountering a lot of issues. Settings changed on their own and couldn't be reverted, the watch stopped showing alerts or vibrating to indicate incoming e-mails, calls, or text messages, and my iCalendar is no longer syncing and showing me upcoming appointments, except for on odd occasions of its own choosing. I'm becoming quite frustrated after going through all the troubleshooting, unpairing, re-coupling and then soon encountering the same issue, and two calls to Fossil's phone support so far have not solved the problem. Either I have a glitchy watch or this product doesn't play as well with IOS as might be hoped. When it's working, it's five star, but right now, it's disappointingly a watch/fitness tracker with a short battery life and a penchant for failing when I'm counting on it. If Fossil comes through with the escalated support they've promised, I will update and upgrade this review. If not, I will similarly adjust.<br /><br />I'm very excited about the Fossil Q Women's Gen 4 Smartwatch (in Stainless). It's so much sleeker and less bulky than an earlier (and far less functional) hybrid watch I own and was forever banging into things because it was so thick.  The Fossil really looks good, too, with just the right amount of sparkle on the bezel and included band, even though I did take it to my nearest Fossil retailer (fortunately there's one close by) to have links removed. It's amply sized upon arrival with a band that can be changed out to mesh, leather, or silicon options if you prefer. (I love the included band, but it's good to have options.)<br /><br />Fossil's Smartwatch has a customizable screen, with various styles and backgrounds that you can change for looks from fun to athletic to dressy or functional. You can even upload photos from your social media accounts.  (Caveat: I have an iPhone and it took me a couple of tries to get the interface to work at all. Even then, I could only access a few pictures. I may try this again later, but I found a plain, black background much easier to read the text against than my photos, so I haven't since bothered with this feature, as legibility/functionality matter more than another cute picture of my dog.)<br /><br />Setup and instructions were quite simple compared to my previous hybrid watch. I charged the phone in about an hour, downloaded the app, and followed the simple instructions onscreen to set up Bluetooth and sync the watch to my iPhone. I was able to effortlessly import my Google account (note:I have Gmail, but since I'm using Apple Mail to access it, I did have to download another app to get my e-mail to show up) and I was pleasantly surprised to see how easily and well this worked with my iCal. I'm receiving notifications with no problem, and the screens are pretty intuitive. Messages are fairly easy to read on the screen with sharp, clear, high-contrast text, and text messages come in the same way.<br /><br />The watch allows you to set up Google Assistant, which is an Alexa-like artificial intelligence program that can help you accomplish a host of functions, allowing you to use voice commands to set up reminders, check the weather or messages, take a reading of your heartrate, etc. I've had a little trouble getting it to understand me at first, but I look forward to playing with this some more to see what it can do.<br /><br />Android users can use their watches to return texts or reply to calls. iPhone users don't have this available, but you can see what's incoming and only take out the phone to respond if it's a wanted/necessary interruption to your meeting, class, or conversation. Far less intrusive than having your phone out and possibly getting drawn into unwelcome distractions.<br /><br />If you're into fitness, this thing is terrific. Water resistant (though you'll want to put it into &#34;Theater Mode&#34; according to the instructions), it can be used as a step-tracker, heart rate monitor, and for all sorts of workout routines. There's also a Google Wallet feature where you can load credit card info if you'd like to pay at some terminals and many other available functions, including apps from third-party vendors, which can be downloaded. A nearly seventeen-minute video (which you can see on the Amazon detail page for this product) give a great overview of the watch, there's good support online, and a big, fat, tiny-print manual (that I hope to never have to read!) is  included with your purchase. I was also able to get help and advice at my local Fossil Store, so if you're lucky enough to have one nearby, you may find it worthwhile to stop by. I found them friendly and very willing to help no matter where the product was purchased.<br /><br />A charge lasts about a day with average use, much like a smartphone. You can do better by adjusting screen brightness, apps updating in the background, etc., but it's one more thing you'll need to charge (magnetic USB charger included) at the end to the day.<br /><br />I would give this product 5 stars for the Android user and 4 for the Apple user, since their are a few things (minor, to my way of thinking) that are a little more difficult to set up or work only with Android phones. At a $275 price (current cost of rose gold version), the Fossil Q Gen 4 is at least $50 less than the least expensive AppleWatch. The Fossil Q doesn't perform all of the latter's functions, but it's a great-looking, highly functional smartwatch for its price point, and I love its styling, too, which doesn't call attention to the fact that it's a high-tech gadget.<br /><br />Would make a fantastic gift--for yourself or any woman who wants a work-appropriate watch that will keep her calendar, messages, fitness info and  more organized and, oh, yes, also tell the time!"

That's the biggest con.<br /><br />Unknowns<br />- I'll update this as I use it for feedback on wear and tear, and to see if the pink color gets dirty.<br />- Haven't tested whether it's actually water resistant yet, but I also don't really want to deliberately expose it to water, you know? But maybe I'll do it after I've used it for a long time.<br /><br />Overall, solid choice if you want to pay a little extra for peace of mind."

Since I don't have an extra copy of Win 7 around, I am installing Vista Ultimate for my HTPC. One problem I have is that the Renesas USB 3.0 controller for the rear USB 3.0 ports. Not sure if this is Vista problem, but the files that came with the CD won't install at all. I tried with the version from NEC/Renesas, same problem. No AV and I have disabled other services via msconfig, still no go. tried with SP1 and SP2 installed, nada. The front USB 3.0 are Intel H81 and they are working just fine. Other than that and a few hiccups when Vista boots up ( it would stuck on blank screen 1/5 times when starting, even in Safe Mode), the board is great.<br /><br />Note; No Anti Virus or other third party hardware/software installed. Only bare Windows Vista Ultimate,a LG DVD drive, and a WD Red HDD. I checked MSI site and the board supports vista/7/8, but all of the drivers are only in Win 7/8....<br /><br />Maybe I should have gone with the ASRock MB, but I want USB 3.0... at least i got the front USB 3.0 ports running!"

I was building a new computer for video editing instead of gaming, so rendering was my priority. If I was building a computer strictly for gaming, I probably would have gone with a new Intel i7. But so far I have been very impressed with this processor. Since Ryzen is still fairly new, keeping everything updated with the current drivers is recommended. Also, I noticed a significant boost in performance when I downloaded the Ryzen power management settings for Windows 10.

After installing, the temperature never exceeded 50C (I don't run CPU heavy things much). My initial concern was the potential increase in the noise, after installing such a big fan.

AFIUP6G7EZYWMKIJZV3SMWLDDBMQ,B00V7NOV3Q,5,12,True,Edit: Just replaced my computer.  My new graphics card is an RTX 3090 and SSD is Western Digital SN850.  The cable now works perfectly up to 144hz in the Valve Index and has not caused any startup issues.  I guess it was just a fluke with my old computer which had a GTX 1080 Ti.<br />----<br />This cable paired with the Cable Matters DisplayPort Repeater (ASIN: B07D949F59) is working with my Valve Index at least up to 120hz without any artifacts.  144hz looks almost like one eye draws faster than the other causing a smearing/shadow along the edges of everything while moving.  Luckily I never saw much of a difference between 120hz and 144hz so 120 is fine with me.  This cable did NOT work with the Cable Matters DisplayPort Coupler (ASIN: B00YFPM2CU).<br /><br />A strange issue worth noting is that my computer's boot drive disappears from the BIOS if this cable is plugged in prior to turning on.  If I start my computer then plug in the cable after boot everything is fine.  If I have the cable plugged in then turn on my computer it won't boot because it can't see my SSD.  Tried a different video card and motherboard and the issue continued.  I can't even begin the fathom why this happens but I've tried so many fiber optic display port cables without any success I'll live with it for now.  If you also happen to have an Intel 750 SSD or other PCIe slot SSD be advised this cable may cause you grief.

AELWZ4FR5NDFQSNIBSSPOBJT3DRQ,B07HC44PM6,3,6,False,"After spending hours searching for bluetooth hours I ran across these. The first thing that stuck out to me was the price which was only $40 and the reviews were suspiciously high. After being disappointed by the SoundPEATS True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds 5.0 which had an annoying beeping problem and very slightly clicks noise caused by the buttons I decided to give these a go. I can say without a doubt these are incredible.<br /><br />Sound:<br />They sound very good and defiantly better than your average wired headphones. I was very surprised as bluetooth headphones typically are ok but sometimes don't sound as good as cheap wired ones, but its not the case here. They have a little bass and songs are clear but you can still hear the instrumentals quite well. If your expecting near $200 good audio sound you won't find it here but the sound is really amazing. Watching youtube videos sound more full clear and rich. Its noticeable when going back to my cheaper wired headphones. Also btw these do support the aptX codec (not aptX hd which is pretty rare to see on most headset). I would also say they sound a bit more clear than the Soundpeats.<br /><br />Pairing:<br />The neat thing is when you take them out of the case they auto pair. It did take me a while to get the auto pair working with my phone but I realized they preferred my MacBook funny enough. I'd recommend making sure bluetooth is off for other devices paired because the auto pair will chose one closest or randomly if they in the same proximity. They also is a voice that says ""pairing"" when taking them out and putting back in turns them off automatically and starts charging. The connection is bluetooth 5.0 and has good range.<br /><br />Battery life:<br />The main reason I got these ear buds is the monstrous 60 hours+ battery life which is definitely real. I was skeptical because often manufactures claim a device to have certain battery capacities on product listings but the actual product is different but not in this case. The case is 2200 mah but what is special is the earbuds batter capacity which is 60mah (sound peats were 39mah) which is the highest I've seen (for the earbuds themselves). You can a bit over 4 hours of continuous listing with these which is above the normal 3 hours or 3.5 of the sound peats I had before! The earbuds charge fast although I'm not sure exactly how long they take to charge but its just fast. The back of the case can show you how much charge is left which I was concerned about but the fact that they included this, shows the attention to detail. It goes like this: 100% - 4 blinks, 75%-50% - 3 blinks, 50%-25% - 2 blinks, and 25%-0% is one blink.<br /><br />Calls:<br />You can answer calls by clicking on any of the buttons and you can hear from both ears or one if your in mono mode. The call quality was amazing which is one of the reasons why I bought these too. I made 3 phone calls and every I asked said it sound good. Phone calls will drain the battery life a bit faster but that's with every headset.<br /><br />Buttons: The buttons on the earbuds don't click easily. I don't sound this as a con at all but intelligent design. Pushing a tiny button in your ear will push the bud even further and may cause pain. If you want to play and pause you'll have to take on bud out and click on of the buttons unless you want to fiddle and hold the bud halfway in your ear. This also possibly prevent super clicks buttons (like the SoundPEATS) or accidental misclicks of touch controlled bluetooth buds.<br /><br />Comfort. The earbuds themselves have rubber numbs on the top of them which can help them stay in your ear. I like how half of the bud is rubber. It may not do too much for comfort but its better than plastic and feels strangely nice to hold. I felt they stayed in my air very well and haven't fallen out at all.<br /><br />I couldn't believe I paid $40 for these as they're easily worth $70-$100. The incredible battery life, excellent sound and call quality, bluetooth 5.0, neat auto pairing, and the bonus of being water resistant makes these buds the jack of all trades.<br /><br />Soundpeats earbuds I was referring to: They were fine but I got a defective pair and didn't want to take a 2nd chance. I'd say these Mindkoo definitely beat the soundpeats in all categories tho.<br />https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HNCL7G2/?coliid=I3FKZOJBYHPJ0Q&colid=1TQQ7HPPP6EYC&psc=0&ref_=lv_ov_lig_dp_it<br /><br />Update (1/28/19):<br />It looks like these headphones struggle to maintain a stable connection. When in my pocket especially then constantly crack up and even more so when I cover my phone with my hand in my pocket. Very strange will update if it goes away but these are likely a deal breaker.<br /><br />Update: 2/17/19<br />I did eventually return them they didn't have a strong connection. I recommend spending more on a bluetooth earbud that has a higher range as 33 ft is on the lower side. You only really notice when walking through a busy area."

There is a Button - inside a Button if you will - They both need to be pressed in unison & held for the device to Turn On/Pair.<br /><br />Sound for Non Calls is Okay - Sort of a Dual Mono more than Stereo - With Overall Sound more toward the Treble Side - Bass is thin at best. Sometimes I feel the Music Volume is a Wee Bit Too Low - Also with YouTube Videos or Equivalent - The Volume can be on the Low Side.<br /><br />Comfort Factor is on the Low to Moderate Side  - they are a Bit Tight - I have the Smallest Ear Pads on them & they still sort of hurt.  Longevity of use will have you taking them out - here and there -  to rest your inner ears. For Working Out - or Highly Physical Movement - they would be Moderately Okay - Sweat does effect them - they get a little slippery under profuse sweating. However - when I wear Beanies - they stay put a little better when sweaty.  They also conceal very nicely under this type of hat - is that's something you wear often.<br /><br />So They have Quarks - But are Fairly Dependable - They do have an Industrial Motorola Work Horse Quality - a bit Rough in Comfort & Sound.

I'll upload some pictures too.  First I added a new wireless card, it wasn't the easiest to find but it added dual band N and bluetooth for under $25 and is a cinch to install. just remember to get the drivers from the intel website for it, they increased my range considerably.  Its link is [[ASIN:B007QXLIWI Intel Network 6235AN.HMWWB Centrino WiFi Card Advanced-N 6235 Dual Band Bluetooth Retail]]  Second I added a matched set uf crucial 4 GB ram modules, dont think it really maters wheather or not they are matched or if they will run dual channel but figured what the heck [[ASIN:B003DZJQQI Crucial 8GB Kit (4GBx2) DDR3 1333 MT/s (PC3-10600) CL9 SODIMM 204-Pin Notebook Memory Modules CT2KIT51264BC1339]]  Lastly I added a crucial M4 128gb SSD, the machine runs fine with a traditional HDD, but starts from sleep almost instantly with the SSD.  This isn't my main machine, and honestly is much more useful than my 64gb iPad I paid twice as much for.  Adding the SSD takes a little work though.  Make the restore usb stick using the acer recovery program first of all.  If you want to overprovision the drive is where it gets tricky.  SSD's do wear out over time.  It will likely outlast two of these little portables, but overprovisioning set some space aside to be used to replace some of the blocks as they wear out.  I'm no good with linux but a friend pointed me to a program called Hdat2.  It allows you to create a HPA (hidden protected area), BUT you need to boot to it from a disk on a windows machine with standard bios and not UEFI.  If you are good with linux you could also do this easily with a bootable distro.  Just make sure you get the 7mm version of the drive so it will fit.

As far as a speed I was a little cncerned about the celeron, it seems to be keeping up just fine.  I dont think I would attempt to game on it.  I would make the recovery discs for them, I just used to USB keys (one has to be at least 16 GB), and tossed them in the box, hopefully I'll never need them.<br /><br />Original review:<br />I'm going to write my initial impressions and update this review as I put it through the paces a little.  As far a build quality its a plastic netbook.  Its no macbook air, but its also $700 less.  The trackpad has a little bit of rattle to it, but isnt bad.  the screen is nice, the viewing angle fair with good resolution and no bad pixels (a pet peeve of mine).  I wouldn't go any smaller as far as sub-notebooks go in screen size and resolution, I had an 8.9 and 10.1, both were awful.  This feels like you could get some work done on it.  It great in respect to upgrade-ability.  The bottom comes off by just removing one screw and siding off the bottom.  This is fantastic!  My last netbook required that you remove the keyboard and the clips never went back quite right.  I already upgraded the Ram to 8 gig (i had an extra 4 gig module in a drawer) and its much better than atom based models I've had in the past.  It looks like it would be an easy upgrade to an SSD and have a great machine on the cheap.<br /><br />I did have the wireless problem another reviewer had, I updated the driver through device manager and have been good to go since.  The trackpad for some reason is set to natural scrolling, which I hate on my mac.  You can turn it off but need to dig into the program files a little to find the setting.  There is a bunch of crapware to disable, but thats no big surprise.<br /><br />Overall a really nice value for the money.  I wanted something cheap and portable, but not my main machine so it doesn't need to be ultra fast or fancy.  Most of my frusterations just stem from Windows 8.  It isn't bad per se, actually very innovative, but also has a pretty steep learning curve, making things i used to do intuitively much more difficult.  Maybe its the comfort of having the desktop as an option keeps me from fully embracing ""metro"", I dunno.  If you have any questions please comment and I'll do my best to help."

AGNLRIXUGGGR4E47KQDGWOG6ZGMQ,B076NZTY3J,4,7,False,"The CORSAIR ONE PRO manages to put a lot of power into a rather small and smartly-designed package.  Built primarily for computer games with high-end graphics that hog memory and generate a lot of heat, this desktop delivers on the basics as well.<br /><br />WHAT YOU GET (and DON’T GET)<br /><br />The box contains simply the basics … the computer, power cord and set-up instructions (no gratuitous keyboard, mouse or monitor).  The unit is approximately 8” deep, 7” wide and 15” tall … it weighs a somewhat hefty 16 pounds.  The noteworthy components of this desktop:<br /><br />- 32GB DDR4 RAM<br />- 4.2 GHz Intel Core i7<br />- 2 TB hard disk drive<br />- 500 GB solid state hard drive<br />- NVIDIA GTX 1080 graphics card<br />- 8 USB ports (6 3.0 and 2 2.0)<br />- Windows 10 (Home version)<br /><br />The computer’s initial setup is simple and quick.  Unlike a lot of pre-packaged computers, the CORSAIR ONE is NOT loaded with annoying bloatware.  Aside from Windows 10 and a Corsair system monitoring/updating program, the machine runs quite clean.  It is important to note that there is not optical disk drive or memory card slots.<br /><br />WHAT I LIKE ABOUT THIS MACHINE<br /><br />- It is REALLY quiet … at all times.  The only sound I can compare it to is like the machine is exhaling … a low breathing hum.  The only noticeable sound is a quick “blink” when it shuts down going into sleep mode … no beeps, chirps, grinding or whirring fan noises.<br /><br />- The components are high-end (at the moment) and can easily handle the graphic-intensive games that consume memory and generate a lot of heat.  While I still have an affinity for older computer games, I’m currently playing COD WW2 which is somewhat graphically demanding.  While I generally play the game on a high-end laptop, the CORSAIR ONE created a much more immersive environment (sound and graphics) … a significantly noticeable difference that made playing the game more enjoyable.  The processing speed is more than admirable, and I have yet to run into any problems affecting or inhibiting gameplay.<br /><br />- The cooling system is smartly designed.  With vents on the sides and a large cooling fan on the top … heat is pulled from the components out driven out the top of the machine.  The top of the rig is where the heat goes, the rest stays relatively cool.<br /><br />- Compact, clean and sturdy housing.  The shell of the computer is aircraft-grade aluminum (black).  It’s rather small rectangular design is clean and simple … only a power switch, a HDMI and USB port show in the front (along with some minimal blue access lighting that indicates the machine is awake).  At approximately 16 lbs., the compact chassis brick-solid.<br /><br />- The 2 TB hard drive is large enough to accommodate a descent amount of high-end games; the 500 GB solid state drive tips the scale in my opinion.<br /><br />- Because the machine isn’t loaded with unnecessary and useless software, you do not have to deal with annoying reminders and advertising.  The only thing I found annoying was the Corsair system monitor which was continually indicated new updates/versions available, even though there were none … a preference change fixed that issue.<br /><br />- After 3 months, I have experienced NO ISSUES at all with this machine.<br /><br />THINGS TO CONSIDER<br /><br />- The minimalist nature of the CORSAIR ONE will likely not suit everyone.  Again, there is no optical disk drive and while disks are rendered somewhat outdated, many playable older disk-driven games are still playable (thanks to Windows 10).  Fortunately, external disk drives are rather cheap these days.<br /><br />- With only one USB port in the front of the machine, you might find yourself figuring out what gets priority use of the single USB port in the front.  I wished there were more USB ports in the front … and even a memory card slot.<br /><br />- From what I can see, the CORSAIR ONE is designed to be a modern single purchase that is intended to handle the latest high-end gaming system requirements, not a machine for upgrading.  Most serious gamers like to tweak their systems by swapping/upgrading hardware, so this may be a turn-off to some hardcore gamers.  On the other hand, this simple one-stop-shop approach is perfectly fine for those who want a high-end rig that should last a while without having to upgrade.<br /><br />- Unfortunately, as with most PCs today, the Windows 10 package doesn’t include any Microsoft Office basics.  While it is a gaming PC, it’s also an excellent all-around computer rig.<br /><br />For those who want a ready-set-go high-end gaming system, you really cannot go wrong with the CORSAIR ONE PRO.  A smartly-designed lean machine that is compact, simple, quiet and powerful."

The chip is super easy to install and sped up my processing time by about 30%.<br /><br />I have a Dell Inspiron 530 (regular, not the slim version) with 3 GB of Ram that I bought about 3 years ago. The PC had an old Intel Celeron, 1 core, 2.20 Ghz processor and lately I noticed that I would get a perpetual hourglass whenever I tried to run several newer programs at once. Instead of spending $500-$600 on a new computer, I decided to upgrade the processor. It was a terrific choice.<br /><br />Installation was super easy (just be sure to refer to you owner's manual, which you can get online, and/or view a few YouTube videos) and my computer now runs like a champ.<br /><br />Just don't forget to buy thermal grease to coat the processor and heatsink or your new Intel Duo core E8400 will overheat! I purchased Zalman ZM-STG1 Super Thermal Grease from Amazon.com and it worked like a charm. Also, be sure not to throw out your old heatsink/fan because the one that comes with the Intel Processor might not fit your motherboard. It didn't fit mine because it uses push-pin type clamps instead of screws. My Dell motherboard required 4 screws so I just reused the one I had (after applying some thermal grease) and it worked just fine. My new Intel E8400 CPU idles at 35C and spikes no higher than 47C at full load, which is perfect.<br /><br />Just note - after installing the Intel Duo Core E8400, you might have to reboot your computer twice. On the 2nd try, my PC worked fine and I immediately noticed how much faster I could accomplish my tasks. And my Windows experience scores jumped too. My processor speed went from a 4.3 rating to 5.6, my memory rating went from 4.9 to 5.9, and my primary hard disk went from 5.1 to 5.9.<br /><br />I love this Duo Core processor!"

AFIVATT2AOMOJIZPMLQZZLEU5CIQ,B00FPG37R2,4,0,False,"This is a nice basic network security camera for home users. It was fairly easy to set up and has good features like night vision and a speaker for two-way audio. However, the user interface for accessing it from a PC is rather clunky; the Android app actually seems better.<br /><br />Setup:<br /><br />Wired setup using an Ethernet cable worked flawlessly.<br /><br />Wireless setup: The way you enter your WiFi password is to type it into the Lorex Ping app on your smartphone/tablet and hold it in front of the camera, which scans the QR code from your phone to acquire the password. Using my Android phone with their app took a couple of tries. I don't know why but I had to run through the steps twice.  Anyway, it still took less than 5 minutes in total to get it working.<br />The annoying part however is that it seems to have forgotten the password after being powered off (unplugged) for a while. The QR code didn't work and I had to resort to connected it with an Ethernet cable, then entering the WiFi password manually in the Android app (Blue arrow next to camera ID in camera list > Camera settings > Network > WiFi network) It can take several minutes to reconnect to WiFi.<br /><br />Remote connection and security:<br /><br />Once connected to your local network whether by cable or WiFi, a smartphone or PC on the same network with the Lorex app can detect the camera and connect to it. You are strongly encouraged to set a password for the camera to prevent other people from gaining access to it.<br /><br />Viewing video worked fine on both my Android phone and my PC (see additional comments below). Away from home over a mobile connection, video seemed a little slower but not too bad.<br /><br />The Android app is pretty good and has a lot of options in the settings for connection, security, setting alarms, etc.<br /><br />I really don't like the design of the PC software. It looks like it's from the 90s, and the mic and speaker icons are reversed in what I intuitively thought their functions were (others may disagree). The aspect ratio of the video is squashed horizontally even though it says 1024 x 768, and it is pixelated (this is testing with both my PC and the camera on my home LAN, so it shouldn't be a bandwidth problem?)<br /><br />Video:<br />The framerate is fine when testing it in my own home. It's choppy over mobile broadband but I imagine that's an effect of my mobile provider's speed rather than the Android app, since display on the app is fine when testing it over WiFi at home. It seems OK when viewing from someone else's home network.<br /><br />The nice thing is that this has an infrared camera and an infrared LED which should turn on automatically when it's dark. The threshold for when it turns on is a little darker than it should be, however, because when it's evening there is a period when it's too dark to see but the infrared hasn't cut in yet. When it works it's a nice sharp grayscale.<br /><br />Audio:<br />The pick-up from the microphone is not exactly fantastic but then again, it's not intended to be an audio recording device. There is a fair bit of background hiss. You can however hear sounds well enough.<br /><br />As for the speaker - it works OK now that I've discovered that the default gain in the PC app is set way too high. I thought something was wrong because words were coming out extremely crackly and unintelligible when I spoke into my laptop mic. Turning down the gain in the PC app fixed the issue. (The top volume slider is for output of your PC mic to the camera's speaker; the bottom slider is for camera mic to PC speakers. They don't line up with the icons and they're unlabelled - another example of the rather poor PC app design.)<br /><br />In the Android app there is a single button to activate/mute 2-way audio instead of separate ones for the speaker and mic.<br /><br />There is also an alarm button that sets off an annoying alarm sound. I guess this would be useful to let intruders know you've seen them.<br /><br />Motion sensor function:<br />Have not tested yet. Will update when I do.<br /><br />Alarms:<br />You can set alarms for either the motion sensor or the infrared camera to go off in the app or send you an email. Have not tested yet. Will update when I do."
AE2HHCZARXNN3PDMFANR7XK23LIA,B0752GDGS6,4,1,False,"This is very much a laptop that wants you to think it's better than it is. It looks sort of like a Mac Book, it has a fancy lit keyboard. it has a nice screen, though the screen is not touch-enabled, which feels like a step backward for any laptop over $500. Beneath the hood, it really is just a standard Windows laptop. It's a step above cut-rate $300 laptops for sure, but certainly no Mac Book. First of all, the shell is plastic (though it's made to *look* like brushed aluminum). Second, while its processor is an Intel, making it automatically better than the cheap AMD laptops, this laptop still has integrated graphics and not a dedicated graphics card and only 8 gigs of RAM; so the &#34;casual gamer&#34; mentioned in the product description basically means Facebook games (don't bother installing Steam). Don't get me wrong -- this is a decent performing laptop that's a step above entry level.

Other Chromebooks have kind of anemic specs that wouldn't work so well, but this one does well with a respectable 4 GB of RAM, 32 GB of hard drive space, and an Intel Celeron Quad-Core processor."
AGDRM77VBMNQDCETWX5WQX7XUPPA,B00BCA9JW2,5,3,False,"This was an upgrade to a very old and outdated tower desktop that I had, and I wanted to upgrade and make sure that my new computer would be able to enjoy modern games and multimedia without any problems. I'm also going to be a second-year university student this fall, so I needed something to cover media and music-intensive applications for my major and something that would be portable and powerful.<br /><br />The high-end Core i7 processor and powerful Nvidia mobile graphics card and high RAM capacity and enormous HDD with an SSD cache all fit together for a powerful combo punch of power and performance. I've never had a choppy frame rate or a lag issue with any of my games or videos that I've run, even with all the settings on High. This laptop delivers stunning performance and a very slick build design makes sure the heat gets routed out the side vents and the core components are kept nice and cool. Fan noise is not a distracting issue either, and it runs very quietly.<br /><br />One gripe I have is that a week after I bought this computer, Intel released their new 4th-generation Core i7 processors, and the new Lenovo devices are currently shipping with them. If I had been more up-to-date on technology news, I would have realized that Intel has released a new generation of their processors every June for the last few years, and I would have waited just a few weeks to grab a new Lenovo machine with a 4th Gen processor inside. Oh well... I'm still very satisfied with my current processor and it does everything I need it for and more. The benchmark performance reports from other websites show a small speed difference of the i7 G4 over the G3, but it's not noticeable or applicable to the average user.<br /><br />Boot times are blazing fast with this machine. Even with the relatively slower disk-spin speed of 5400 RPM instead of desktop Hard drives' 7200 RPM, the paired 16 GB SSD cache works like a charm and delivers speeds almost as fast as if I had the operating system installed on a full SSD drive. I disabled the Windows ""Fast Startup"" option because I don't like caching large hibernate/startup files on my disks, but even with that option turned off and with the SSD cache working in the background, my computer is literally booted up and on the desktop, ready to go, in less than 20 seconds. It's amazing.<br /><br />Note to consumers: I was confused when I bought the 16GB SSD option and then I couldn't access the drive when I got my machine and the Operating System wasn't installed to it. When you buy the IdeaPad model options with additional SSD (Solid State Drive) caches, you will not be able to access them to store files on them, and the operating system will not be installed to them. They're not even visible in the Explorer window, but they are available for view through Windows Device Manager. The purpose of these small additional drives is to be paired with the Hard Disk Drive through a protocol called ""ExpressCache"". The drive works in the background and ""learns"" over time which programs and files you use frequently (boot files, games, programs, etc), and it copies those frequently-used files to the Cache and loads them to the RAM from the cache instead of from your hard drive, because the SSD is roughly 40 times faster than your hard disk drive is. It's not just a computer-industry advertising gimmick - it really works, and for those applications that you use frequently, you achieve amazing speed results. It's even smart enough to phase out the programs you no longer use so frequently in favor of files you currently use a lot. So it's pretty amazing stuff, but you can't access it personally without a lot of messing around in advanced customization stuff...<br /><br />The overall appearance of the laptop is great. It's got a beautiful black brushed-aluminum look and some lovely red backlighted keys (press Fn + Space to turn the backlight on) and the speakers are amazing for laptops - they deliver loud, high-quality sound. A bit lacking on the bass, but what do you expect? They're great for their size. The keyboard is nice and accurate and a joy to type on, and the trackpad is awesome. It's full of awesome functions and works just like the trackpad of Apple Mac laptops - scroll functions, click and right-click functions, gesture controls, etc. I have traditionally hated laptop trackpads forever and I almost always have plugged in wired mice to laptops to avoid using the terrible trackpads, but this trackpad is a joy to use and is fully customizable and intuitive and natural-feeling. I love it. Still don't recommend it for gaming, though, but that's a given.<br /><br />One small con again - the screen size is kind of small. It's a 14"" (diagonally) wide-screen display, but the display is only 768 pixels tall so some applications seem kind of squeezed onto the screen. If you want to spend the extra $100, get the IdeaPad Y500 model which comes with all the same specs and a 15.6"" display to boot. There's a huge bezel around the screen on each side, too, which means that Lenovo could have fit a bigger screen into the machine if they had really wanted to...<br /><br />Lenovo online customer support is great - they have a big forum and message board full of questions other people have asked and efficient and workable answers from Lenovo support staff. Odds are you'll find the answer to a question you have in the Lenovo support forums before even needing to contact them personally. I found answers for even such advanced topics as optimizing my SSD cache and ensuring it is working correctly or changing my BIOS settings for different things (including the always-on USB feature in case you want to turn that off, which is accessible in the BIOS settings), etc. Lenovo representatives who answered questions were both helpful and knowledgeable and took the time to add detailed, thoughtful, helpful solutions for people, and were patient and provided additional information when needed.<br /><br />Overall this was a great experience and I have a great new machine to show for it and Lenovo has a new satisfied, loyal customer who looks forward to purchasing from them in the future as well. I would also recommend Lenovo to anyone who is looking for powerful performance at an excellent price."

First off, let me say that I bought this at the wrong time - I don't really run in the winter and I bought this right before the winter. That's my fault and wasn't the best time to buy this thing...<br /><br />However, I have been able to get out there a few days and test this watch out. I live in a suburban neighborhood in NJ so there are a few trees but no tall buildings whatsoever. There are no cell / radio towers in my area as far as I know. But I'm no communications or IT expert, so I can't speak intelligently about radio interference.<br /><br />Ok ok, on to the review of the damn thing. In a word, average. It takes at least 25 seconds to get the GPS signal on a good day and the last time I ran I was just standing there for 5 minutes before I said screw it and ran without the GPS. These signal-grabbing times simply don't cut it. And, by the way, these are all clear days. As far the GPS tracking, I've checked my route afterwards and it shows me about 10 feet off the path that I ran. Incidentally, it also mapped the same route with differences - some were as much as .09 miles. That might not seem like a whole lot, but it is.<br /><br />All in all, I haven't gotten much utility out of this, notwithstanding that I bought it at the wrong time.

It is so incredibly fast, and is actually just a hair shy of a $500 i7 3930k in most tasks which says a lot. That really is a big deal for a $300 proc.<br /><br />The 4790k idles strangely cool, in the low 20's (C) with my Corsair H80i, and is about 8-10C cooler than an i7 4770k at idle all things being equal.

AEAOXUFYIODGB5YAU3GUY6WIRMCQ,B001P05NJC,5,1,True,"I love the MacBook! You're instantly greeted by glorious full screen brightness. The LED-backlit display is power efficient. And it's mercury and arsenic free. I like the smaller, lighter frame, compared to any PC.  Measuring a mere 1.08 inches thin and weighing in at only 5.0 pounds. It also offers a unique keyboard design that sits flush against the bed for a sleeker, lower profile. Other standard Apple ""extras"" includes a built-in iSight video camera. Stylishly and intelligently designed, the MacBook has everything I am looking for: affordability, innovation, powerful computing. My MacBook has a 2.13 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor with a 160 GB hard drive, plenty of room for music, photos, videos, and more. Hardware features include a built-in Gigabit Ethernet for high-speed networking, Bluetooth 2.1+EDR (Enhanced Data Rate), two USB ports, FireWire, and Mini-DVI video output. Apple has an updated model (10/09) with a 250 GB hard drive. I do not need the extra memory, amazingly, the newer model, does not have a FireWire port.<br /><br />I like Apple's magnetically connected MagSafe power adapter. This feature offers a magnetic connection instead of a physical one.  If you to trip over a power cord, you won't send MacBook flying off a table or desk, the cord simply disconnects, without damage to either the cord or the system. The adapter is easy to connect and disconnect without having to struggle with the connector. Opening and closing your MacBook is also a pleasure, thanks to a magnetic latch, there are no moving parts to snag, jam, or break. Again, I do not have to struggle with some PC toggle switch to open my MAC.<br /><br />The 160 GB Serial-ATA (SATA) hard drive (5400 RPM) high speed transfer of data, akin to FireWire and USB 2.0. The 2 GB of DDR2 RAM (two SO-DIMMs of 512 MB) have an 800 MHz speed, and the RAM capacity can be increased to 4 GB. The 13.3 inch glossy widescreen display, excellent video processing power from the NVIDIA GeForce 9400M integrated graphics chip, and an integrated 802.11n Wi-Fi LAN, provides compatibility with older 802.11b/g routers. It includes an 8x combo Superdrive for burning dual-layer DVDs as well as CDs. It comes pre-loaded with Apple's Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard operating system, the iLife '09 suite of applications, including iPhoto, iMovie, Garageband, and iTunes.<br /><br />Battery lasts  between 5 and 6 hours. The hafnium-infused circuitry--which reduces electrical current leakage in transistors conserves even more energy, giving you more time away from the wall outlet. Apple has worked hard to eliminate many of the toxins that are a common part of computer manufacturing. Apple engineers removed the majority of brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) from circuit boards, internal cables, connectors, insulators, adhesives, in the MacBook.<br /><br />Because Apple makes both the hardware and the software for the MacBook, they're designed to work together to produce a smarter product that uses less electricity. The MacBook hard drive spins down automatically when inactive. The MacBook also decides which processor CPU or GPU is best suited to efficiently perform a task. The processor even throttles down to save power between keystrokes as you type. Together, these adjustments make the MacBook much more energy efficient and result in fewer CO2 emissions.<br /><br />Made in America by Americans. I have gone through four different PCs using Microsoft operating systems in four years.  Microsoft makes a bad product, cheaply and poorly designed made in Asia.  The Asian hard drives constantly failed and crashed.  Programs were slow to load and constantly crashed.  The MAC is fanatstic. The superior Apple product is well designed, efficient and dependable. The Apple MacBook MC240LL/A 13.3-Inch Laptop is the best that I have owned! I thoroughly endorse and recommend Apple products to anyone."
AGNME7F4IAJUQ7OIEIHDUXS2IFVQ,B087YW8FQB,4,1,False,"The Lenovo Ideapad 3 11 Chromebook is a decent deal when found on sale or when purchased with the expectation of using it for entertainment and/or day to day tasks. It especially excels for a younger student needing mobile access to their homework/schoolwork while still fulfilling entertainment needs through the use of another profile (chromebooks are easily shared which makes this great for a family as well due to Chrome profiles).<br /><br />If your organization is also cloud native or using VDI (virtual desktop infrastructure) to remote into a work pc environment then this becomes a powerful mobile laptop. Additionally the igpu is powerful enough for most Play store games/apps.<br /><br />While it isn't as feature rich as some of the more expensive chromebooks it includes similar specs (besides the screen resolution) compared to the average 2018-2020 entry level chromebooks (N-series intel processor with 4gb lpddr4 ram). This chromebook is great for just quickly folding up and bringing along with you like a book due to the small size. For the older demographic though this comes at the cost of usability (screen is too small for some people).<br /><br />The keyboard is just average in my opinion and the screen quality (backlighting and screen viewing angle) is acceptable. Battery life is excellent as I found I rarely had to charge it except for every 2-3 days (using it 4-6 hours per day) while testing it for a few weeks. The Wifi 5 chip picked up signal easily from the edge of my house thanks to the two antennas. Connection was always solid for the wifi and for bluetooth devices (this model has bt 4.2).<br /><br />Overall this is a great device for shared use between family members, for a child, for a student, or for a mobile worker provided they aren't pushing the igpu and ram to their limits. Please keep in mind though that it's only HD resolution and not touch screen. Lastly, the 4gb of ram can be limiting if you keep open dozens of memory hungry Chrome tabs."
AGNME7F4IAJUQ7OIEIHDUXS2IFVQ,B08YX6976Q,4,0,False,"Microsoft is hitting their stride in the ultrabook market with the release of the new Surface Laptop 4. It seems more like a refresh than a redesign (adding an 11th gen intel processor and Wifi 6 chip for this particular model along with other minor changes) but the combined specs of this model and the design choices push it closer to the top of the current ultrabook market. That being said there are definitely a few questionable design choices which should be taken into account before making your decision.<br /><br />First, the metal body of this laptop looks and feels premium. You can tell they've got the chassis design nearly perfected. I honestly prefer it to the body of my 13"" Dell XPS and it feels on par with my M1 MacBook Air's machined-aluminum chassis. It's also incredibly lightweight. Compared to my M1 MBA it makes the surface laptop feel like a tablet almost. It's also lighter than my Dell XPS and most other ultrabooks I've tested though it could be partially due to the Alcantara fabric on this particular version.<br /><br />Port-wise there isn't much to mention. They've included a single usb type-c, a single usb type-a, and a 3.5mm auxiliary port. Unfortunately due to how slim these ultrabooks are becoming, it seems most of the manufacturers are cutting down on I/O.<br /><br />When it comes to the keyboard and trackpad, typing on the Alcantara fabric keyboard and navigating with the medium sized trackpad feels natural and smooth. There's enough feedback (a slight click similar to chiclet style keyboards) and key travel to keep your fingers from getting tired or missing letters due to typing too light. Though I noticed for this model there is noticeable flex on the keyboard most likely due to the Alcantara fabric. This Alcantara fabric doesn't really give me confidence in the longevity of the keyboard due to flex and potential for grease stains ( I have large hands and wrists so likely using more force when typing). The fabric feels soft and smooth to the touch but I would advise choosing the metal version if you're looking for longevity and a more durable keyboard.<br /><br />Windows 10 Home feels snappy on the Surface Laptop 4 with the included nvme ssd. Read and write file transfer speeds are more than quick enough for most use cases (see the crystaldiskmark picture for test results). I'm not doing any compiling on this laptop but I had no issues running Jupyter notebook for quick python scripts. I keep 40-50 chrome tabs open and use a few programs at the same time with no issues. I've also successfully gamed on this laptop (World of Warcraft TBC Classic) though the Ryzen models would probably be better for the gamer crowd due to their integrated GPU performance.<br /><br />The Surface Laptop 4's display looks beautiful and is more than adequate at this size. Color doesn't change at alternate viewing angles and though it's in 8 bit, the colors pop. The touchscreen is also responsive to multi point gestures (pinch and zoom) which is nice to have when browsing reddit or other websites at night. The speakers are just alright, they don't project as well as the M1 MacBook Air but are on par with the XPS. The 802.11ax wireless chip works well and I can pickup my wifi 6 router at the edge of my property while using bluetooth 5.0 headphones. The Webcam is just alright as it's 720p and doesn't pick up lighting as well as some of the other ultrabook webcams.<br /><br />Battery life is slightly lower than the claims for the product description so far but it varies as I've had excellent performance (around 11+ hours or so) when just sticking to regular web browsing and light music listening at lower brightness vs poor performance when streaming 4k video at full brightness (only lasted around 5 hours). Standby battery is decent as well (lasts for days when sleeping) but falls short in comparison to the M1 MBA.<br /><br />Lastly, though the Surface Laptop 4 isn't designed with upgradability in mind, you can remove the bottom of the case and access the nvme ssd to replace it. The LPDDR4 ram is soldered though so you won't be able to upgrade that. Given that ssd/hdd failures are more common it's a nice inclusion and hopefully a sign that Microsoft may move towards more serviceability in the future for their ultrabook products.<br /><br />Overall if you're a student or a mobile business professional, I would recommend this ultrabook. Though I'd ultimately advise getting the metal keyboard version even if it makes it a bit heavier unless you really prefer the texture of the Alcantara fabric."
AGNME7F4IAJUQ7OIEIHDUXS2IFVQ,B08DY6D6G8,5,0,False,"This micro pc was tested initially as a Zoom Room controller in our meeting room just using the preloaded Win 10 Pro OS and by adding an extra 4gb DDR4 RAM SODIMM stick though it still didn't meet zoom room requirements. The Liva Z2 had a few lag spikes and 100% cpu usage while hosting the Zoom Room (connecting to 25+ incoming Zoom users) but was fairly stable while in use for a few weeks with near 99.99% uptime.<br /><br />I then tested this in Kiosk mode with the Windows GoCanvas client hooked up to a touchscreen monitor for our hosted forms. Again this micro pc worked for the assigned task, though I ended up adding an additional stick of 8GB DDR4 2400 SODIMM ram as I was reaching a ram bottleneck with it (bloated native windows app). I would advise flashing the Win 10 OS or dual booting with Ubuntu LTS/CentOS on a separate SATA SSD if you need better performance as Win 10 Pro has high ram usage.<br /><br />Lastly I tested this with Cloudready's ChromeOS even though the hardware isn't  officially supported. I was able to boot in after retrying installation twice and modifying BIOS settings but I did have to install it on a separate SATA SSD ( ADATA SU835 that I mounted inside on the included chassis). It performed as expected in comparison to other N4000 chromebooks.<br /><br />My only criticisms are the lack of an m.2 slot and the minor premium for the included ram which increases the price of this specific configuration.<br /><br />Overall the specs (64gb emmc, 4gb DDR4 2400x1 included, Intel N4000, Intel Wifi 5 (802.11ac) chip, adequate I/O, Win 10 Pro license) are reasonable for the price though you're paying a bit of a premium for the ram and the win 10 pro license.<br /><br />Most Chromebooks on the market at this time use the N4000 and users find it works for basic browser productivity-oriented tasks.<br /><br />While this model certainly doesn't fit the workstation criteria for power users, this micro pc does have its place in the market due to its form factor, vesa mount capability, and non-soldered RAM slots. If you're in the market for a low-profile, budget-friendly, vesa-mountable conference room host or kiosk micro pc , stick two 8gb DDR4 2400 SODIMM ram sticks in here and you should be good to go."
AGNME7F4IAJUQ7OIEIHDUXS2IFVQ,B08JBBM845,5,2,False,"The AX4800 performed solidly over the past month for me as a replacement for my Unifi meshnet. Though my internet is running over coaxial using a docsis 3.0 modem with speeds rated at 300mbp/s dl and 50 u/l, I found my newest wifi 6 capable devices (iPad air 2020 and Acer Triton 500 with intel wifi 6 chip) performed near max rated speeds from around 30m away from the AX4800.<br /><br />With the MU-MIMO streams I was able to comfortably stream 4k video over my plex server to my Intel NUC over wireless while other household members were gaming online (WoW, other xbox games) and streaming netflix. Though this can be accomplished with older 802.11ac routers. Additionally I was impressed with the OFDMA capability as my Zoom meetings for work seemed much snappier when compared to my older 802.11ac meshnet. There was hardly any jitter or ""low bandwidth"" errors encountered in the past 5 Google Meet and Zoom meetings. This indicates that this wireless router would work well in a small business environment with moderate VOIP and UDP video streaming traffic (if laptops or desktops have the 802.11ax compatible wifi chip/card) as well as IoT heavy homes or businesses.<br /><br />Setup was a breeze and the router's web gui accessible through most browsers is preferable to the dlink app for setup in my opinion. As for advanced options there aren't too many firewall features so don't expect to perform significant traffic shaping and setup advanced ACLs. It's fairly barebones but has the features I needed (port forwarding, basic QoS, wpa3 forward secrecy protection).<br /><br />Thankfully I've had zero issues with DHCP server resets or bugs in the current firmware. I'm always weary of DHCP issues as most of the off brand networking equipment seem to have issues with DHCP leasing.<br /><br />One criticism I have which is more geared towards hobbyists or MSP providers is that there doesn't appear to be a release candidate for an OpenWRT firmware as the Dlink ax4800 has a broadcom chipset.<br /><br />Overall I'm pleased with this wireless router and will look into its meshing capabilities in the near future."
AGNME7F4IAJUQ7OIEIHDUXS2IFVQ,B085WSCTS4,5,2,False,"This is one of the easiest 802.11ax (Wifi 6) meshnets to setup and given that the firmware updates and bugfixes are deployed automatically it becomes a ""set it up and forget it"" wireless mesh network perfect for most home owners. Combined with the embedded zigbee smart controller the eero 6 mesh APs and routers is a good deal as other smart controllers run $50-$100 alone. Though there are some quirks with the non-pro model (no gigabit ethernet ports for the extenders so you'll lose half of your dl/ul speeds for each hop from uplink) and data collection practices which should be discussed (mentioned below).<br /><br />Setup is easy enough with the eero app and included documentation, which was completed in under 15 minutes. I still prefer not having to create an account for my networking devices but it seems most networking equipment companies are moving to that model. Besides that though I was ready to go after setting up my primary and guest SSIDs.<br /><br />Performance wise I've had no issues with older 802.11n chipset devices or newer wifi 6 intel wireless chips/cards on windows laptops or macbooks after using the Eero 6 meshnet for the past month. Video stream connection is stable for 4k streaming on 3 devices, online gaming on two consoles, as well as IoT device operation for home monitoring.<br /><br />No DHCP server resets were needed (as seen in other cheaper consumer routers where you have to hard reset every week or two) over the past month. Speed wise I'm getting full dl and ul speed when connected to the main eero 6 router but only half of those speeds from the extenders. Though it's important to note that each hop from the uplink AP (eero 6 router) cuts the bandwidth in half essentially so this is to be expected.<br /><br />While the Eero ecosystem does seem to be pushing towards subscription based operation, Eero secure isn't necessary to run your meshnet so you will still receive firmware updates automatically over the product support lifespan which is good to hear. If they go completely subscription based for normal operation I wouldn't advise purchasing these routers and mesh APs.<br /><br />My only criticism is related to the lack of features on the non-pro model really as I wish the extenders had a gigabit ethernet port so I could plug a few devices in or run cable to get full bandwidth. Also I've heard claims regarding questionable telemetry and data collection practices from Eero though I would advise doing additional research on this matter before deciding to purchase one of the eero 6 mesh systems.<br /><br />Overall this is a solid wifi 6 meshnet to future proof your home provided that you're not looking at getting gigabit fiber in the near term. If you've gigabit fiber already I'd advise purchasing the eero 6 pro model."

AENX27KXBJTZVFNTACHU2VNK46NA,B001DJE486,5,1,True,"I recently was gifted a new system by a friend, an Intel Core 2 Duo and DP965LT board. I'd upgraded from a Pentium III, and the card I was running was an [[ASIN:B003S79OX6 Ati Radeon 9200 128MB]], and I'd had it since time immemorial (about five years plus). It was decent, but I needed something to match the new system. After some searching and price matching, I decided on this card for a few reasons.<br /><br />1) It's inexpensive. I paid $45 for this card, which falls right into my tiny budget. Sure there's better things out there, but for me, this was perfect. Avoid the 1024MB card, it's more expensive, and this one can use your system RAM to bump up to that level anyway if needed.<br /><br />2) It performs well. This card is capable of running most anything made before 2009 at decent quality and framerate (Far Cry 2 at medium-high settings is quite pleasant), and blows away anything before 2005 (Source engine games like Portal look amazing). Not the cutting edge, but more than enough for my purposes.<br /><br />3) SLI capability. If you have dual PCI-E x16/x16 or PCI-E x16/x8, this card can be SLI'd with any other 9500GT, for roughly a 70% increase in performance. I'm planning on upgrading my motherboard to a ASUS P5N-D (about $90) and another one of these for only another $50. Sure I could probably hold out for a 9600GT, but I'd rather work with what I have. And the new board would give me SLI capability for dual GTX460's down the road.<br /><br />In all, this is an excellent card if you're on a bit of a budget. Without getting technical, it's not the latest and greatest, but it'll do the job for most casual gamers who don't mind playing the older stuff. A definite buy."
AHI4K7T65TQHUIJHYTRU63JF264Q,B00FRCK0SI,4,1,True,"Looked into a portable NUC like machine based on the new Intel form factor.  Happened to need a mini projector as well, so went with this barebones system.  The projector works great both as a standalone computer with externally connected monitor, or as a standalone projector. But does not work good as a computer projector.  Why?  The native resolution is too small and lots of things won't fit the native resolution of the projector making the user needing to scroll and pan around windows and documents as well as presentations.  I've used the projector mainly for watching movies in dark rooms and used the computer portion by itself for work and browsing.  The fan from the projector is not too loud but almost always on.  Built in speakers really is just on/off - no real volume adjustment.  It uses little power so I brought it camping using an inverter and a portable battery to watch full movies.  Uses only small form factor SSD, and laptop memory, so is basically a laptop ultrabook platform architecture.  For the after rebate price - you can't beat the value for a projector and computer.  In hind sight I'd probably still buy separate devices, Intel NUC and mini LED projector, since although it does work well, its a bit of a hassle to disconnect the computer from external monitor to use as an entertainment projector.  I tend not to like to move my computer around but a portable projector is good specifically for portability.  I can't see this as a good sales person portable presentation tool since the native resolution is too low, and they won't provide drivers to downscale to this resolution."

It will not perform to its maximum on an SATA II port or with non-Intel controllers.  After all is said and done, the primary virtue of an SSD is loading the OS quickly and loading programs quickly.  The computing power of your machine will govern the speed of operations in most programs unless the program uses a large image file and swaps it frequently (photoshop, premiere.)  The new OCZ model, ""Max Iops"" is undoubtedly faster, but at a price.<br /><br />It was very easy to install and worked right outta the box.  Loads Win7 64 pro quickly and also Dragon NS, which takes a minute to load on a 2-year-old box with XP.  Because of rapid boot and program loading, I turn my computer off now between uses.  I left my old one on 16/7 because it would otherwise take 3-4 minutes to get to readiness with both OS and programs.<br /><br />I had one instance where the BIOS would not recognize the drive during bootup after Windows 7 64pro froze.  My research shows a very obscure cause for this, having to do with low power management features of the OS.  I have not had any BSODs nor has the freeze been replicated, so I am taking no action, but apparently OCZ has released firmware 2.09 to address the problem.  Remember that the drive's firmware cannot be updated while it is a boot drive, so once you have installed OS and updates, it is very inconvenient to start over just to upgrade firmware.  Use the secure wipe feature of OCZ toolbox before upgrading firmware.  Better yet, check the firmware and upgrade before intalling this as a boot drive."

Previously you had to spend double this amount to even get started with a decent drone. The old done came in a huge box and could not be collapsed. And finally the older drones took hours of flight practice to get any kind of reasonable result. Not so with the DJI Mavic Pro.<br /><br />This drone folds up so compact, it easily will slide into any backpack and most camera bags. The intelligent flight modes make it a breeze to fly even for the uncoordinated such as myself. The excellent 4k optics bring home the shot and provide impressive results. Best yet the safety features and obstacle avoidance capabilities do what they can to protect you from your own stupidity. There are of course some exceptions. See attached.<br /><br />As mentioned there are exceptions and flying over water is one of them and should only be done with great care. Many of the safety features will not help, especially when launched above water. Returning to home on a boat that is no longer there will not work. I loved my DJI Mavic Pro. At least I did until I sent it for a swim. Now it is 60 ft under water. I do not recommend using this device under water, it does not float, but rather sinks rapidly. Out to attempt a dive to recover later this week. The dive attempt failed. I have since replaced the drone.<br /><br />The included 16 GB micro SD card is inadequate for recording 4k video. With the stock card installed, I was only able to select 2K mode. However, I upgraded to an amazing Sandisk Extreme Plus 128GB SD card and had no issues at all and was able to record at 4k and download the video quickly to my PC with the chip removed. I recommend this micro SD card or a smaller version of the same.<br />http://amzn.to/2tfCQbQ<br /><br />With an excellent card reader such as<br />http://amzn.to/2shF9Ou<br />or<br />http://amzn.to/2svvZi0<br />See the attached benchmark copying the MicroSD I am using in my Mavic Pro. With the Saicoo USB reader it is about 10x as fast as copying from the DJI directly, and 5x as fast as using a generic USB 2 reader. Even in a USB 2 port it is still 2x faster than the generic USB 2 stick reader that came bundled with a different card.<br /><br />Honestly the 128GB is overkill, I was worried about the size of the 4k video files. Unfortunately there is a bit more compression used than I would have preferred so the files are not too large. Still the video comes out great.<br /><br />The camera mode is able to shoot in RAW and can capture some breathtaking views. The attached represent HDR and panoramas created with minimal effort using the DJI Mavic Pro.<br /><br />The ease of use with this drone is just mind blowing. It can be flown in tap to fly where you tap in the screen and it flies itself recording along the way with no effort.<br /><br />I do recommend this set of ND filters as they will help reduce white blow-out on sunny days. They can stay equipped through the initialization cycle which seems to be an issue with some other options.<br />http://amzn.to/2tfBuxV<br /><br />If you plan to fly above water I strongly recommend this device, or other efforts to make sure you can at least recover your device. The DJI insurance will not cover the drone unless you have the drone. This recovery device will pop up with a string attached to the drone should it enter the water.<br />http://amzn.to/2svND5d<br /><br />I also recommend the Fly More combo as battery life is 15-20 min of flight time.

While it may not provide the crushing performance of the 1080, it gets the job done without totally blowing the budget, maybe just a little stretch.<br /><br />If you have the money, the 1080 is a much better card and will run games faster, farther into the future than the 1080.  Also if you already own a 980 TI, R9 295X2, R9 Fury X, or better, the 1070 will not be an upgrade and you should consider the 1080.<br />http://amzn.to/2upKr7U<br /><br />I purchased the FTW with 1797 clock, the 08G-P4-6276-KR version. EVGA makes several versions of this card and it can be difficult to determine what the difference between them is.  I will try to do so here.<br /><br />Glossary<br />Blower Cooling - Cooling that uses a blower style cooler and heatsink.  Economical design.<br />ACX3.0 Cooling - Advanced cooling system using variable speed fans and heatsinks.  Good design.<br />iCX Cooling - Evolution of ACX3.0 including additional thermal sensors and technology.  Best fan and heatsink design<br />Hybrid Cooling - Closed loop water cooling that requires mounting a radiator on the back of the case.  Very effective cooling<br /><br />Backplate - A metal sheet that is placed over the back of the card further protecting the electronics, and improving heat handling capabilities.<br />RGB LED - An LED that can change color programmatically to any color.  Easily match the color of other items inside your case to maximize flexibility in design.<br /><br />10 Phase Power - An enhanced power supply design that will deliver more consistent power to the graphics processor to insure reliable operation.  More phases means cleaner power, and greater power capacity.  The other design is a 4 phase design.<br /><br />8 pin connector - Add in graphics cards need additional power provided to them.  This is typically done with an 8 pin connector from the power supply.  Some older cards used 6 pin connectors, so some power supplies provide 6+2 connectors, while others provide 8 pin connectors.  You need to make sure that you have the proper number of 8 pin connectors (or 6+2) or you will not be able to power your graphics card and it will not work.  A 6 pin connector will not work, it does not supply enough power, or fit for that matter.  If you do not have either 8 pin or 6+2 pin connectors available, you will need to upgrade your power supply.  This is common in older computers, as well as name brand computers from Dell and HP.  The power supplies were not designed for high power add in cards.<br /><br />08G-P4-5170 1683 MHz boost with blower cooling, requires only a single 8pin connector and draws 150W, no backplate (Blower)<br />http://amzn.to/2v2fkms<br />08G-P4-5171 1683 MHz boost but adds ACX3.0 advanced cooling requires one 8-pin and draws 150W, no backplate  (uncommon model)<br />http://amzn.to/2hsIA14<br />08G-P4-6170  1683 MHz boost with blower cooling one 8pin 150W White LED, adds backplate  (Founders Edition)<br />http://amzn.to/2v3WauV<br />08G-P4-6171 1683 MHz boost ACX3.0 cooling one 8pin 150W  adds White LED (REF)<br />http://amzn.to/2vnJPV9<br />08G-P4-6571 1683 MHz boost iCX cooling and thermal modules single 8pin 150W White LED  (Not on Amazon)<br />08G-P4-5173 1784 MHz boost (super clocked) ACX3 cooling, one 8pin, 170W power White LED, no backplate  (SC Black)<br />http://amzn.to/2v2iDKF<br />08G-P4-6173 1784 MHz boost (super clocked) ACX3 cooling, one 8pin, 170W power White LED (SC)<br />http://amzn.to/2v2t3tm<br />08G-P4-6178 1784 MHz boost Hybrid cooling, one 8pin, 170W power White LED (HYBRID)<br />http://amzn.to/2vnDrNt<br />08G-P4-6573 1784 MHz boost (super clocked) iCX cooling, one 8pin, 170W power White LED (SC2)<br />http://amzn.to/2v2oOhN<br />08G-P4-6274 1683 MHz boost ACX3 cooling, two 8pin, 215W power RGB LED, Enhanced 10 Phase Power Supply for overclocking (FTW 1683)<br />http://amzn.to/2v2G0DF<br />08G-P4-6276 1797 MHz boost super clocked ACX3 cooling, two 8pin, 215W power RGB LED, 10 Phase Power for OC (FTW 1797) (The card I purchased)<br />http://amzn.to/2v2pDHp<br />08G-P4-6278 1797 MHz boost super clocked Hybrid cooling, two 8pin, 215W power RGB LED, 10 Phase Power for OC (FTW HYBRID 1797)<br />http://amzn.to/2v45O0t<br />08G-P4-6674 1683 MHz boost iCX cooling, two 8pin, 215W power RGB LED, 10 Phase Power for OC (Not on Amazon)<br />08G-P4-6676 1797 MHz boost super clocked iCX cooling, two 8pin, 215W power RGB LED, 10 Phase Power for OC (FTW2 1797)<br />http://amzn.to/2upMLMp<br /><br />I chose the model I did, because it had ACX cooling, and the 1797 clock with the 10 phase power and RGB LED.

After 4 years of issues with that one and transitioning to this pc I can say it's like a massive breath of fresh air. For a little over 1800 dollars I got a really great pc that's far exceeded my expectations. Cyberpower stuffed into this thing a Intel 6700K, MSI Z170A Gaming Pro, MSI GTX 980 4GD5T OC, 32 Gigs of ADATA XPG, SanDisk X300 256 Gig SSD, 2 TB Seagate HDD & a AIO Liquid Cooler all into the very sweet looking NZXT S340 case.<br /><br />I can see many years of great usage with this thing compared to my other pc. I was pleasantly surprised that not only did they use the expanding foam method for safe pc transport but they put in a really good mid-range motherboard and a high-end gpu that hasn't barely made a blip on the tech radar due to being fairly new. I look forward to eventually adding 2 fans on the front and possibly upgrading the fan for the radiator. However for now what I've got is good enough for me.<br /><br />Great job to both CyberpowerPC and Amazon for providing such a awesome new pc. Now I can game on without too many worries or issues!"

I owned the previous model (i7 4710, wireless N adapter) and had the well-known wifi issues. They fixed that. Different wifi adapter, works flawlessly. I liked the Nitro so much I was willing to take a chance on this updated model.<br /><br />The laptop is amazingly thin, light, and well built. No flex in the keyboard, tight tolerances, and the plastics and textured cover are good quality. Just like on higher-end cars, companies have figured out how to make plastic and rubberized materials that look expensive. You need two hands initially to lift the screen, which is a good sign and there is zero play in it.<br /><br />One of the biggest selling points on this was that it isn't gaudy. No &#34;republic of gamers&#34; badges everywhere or overdone led lighting. Some of us want to take our laptops to meetings and such. Simple and understated. And it has played any title I wanted it to on ultra settings at native resolution with no problems. I fail to see the need to dish out more cash for a higher-end gpu than this.<br /><br />Fan is quiet. Near silent in slowest mode and noise is not ridiculous when it ramps up. Head dissipates from the back and unlike my previous laptop I do not sweat when using this thing (live in hot climate). I attributed that to the Haswell version of Intel's i7 being know for running hot but they've done a good job with cooling here.<br /><br />Only con is the touchpad isn't the best...tapping for left-click makes it usuable, but synaptics you'd think could do much better. 99% of the time I use a wireless mouse so not a big deal.<br /><br />Amazon service was great from start to finish as usual."

First, the reviewer who says it is cheap and plasticky, I do not get this impression at all. It's a solid laptop with a quality, tight build and ""nice plastics"" as they say in the car interior reviews. This thing looks and feels more upscale than the current crop of Dells and is hundreds cheaper. Comes with GeForce GT745M 2gb and you can set this as default. The Intel graphics are integrated with the 4th generation processors. nvidea's software does a good job of auto-detecting so that you're using Intel graphics when using chrome or whatever and nvidia if playing a game, media player, or again you can just set nvidia as default. The laptop is extraordinarily fast, has an amazing display, and has not crashed or been buggy at all. Runs games beautifully, don't care that it isn't a gtx series gpu.  I'm going from hating to loving Windows 8. I'm glad I waited for a laptop that came with 8.1; have heard upgrading from 8 was a nightmare for many. Also learned that I wanted to be sure to get 1920x1080 resolution and not the 1600x900 that many 17"" coming with. What I didn't get during my laptop research was how much harder it is to find the 17 incher i wanted and was in my price range. Lenovo makes the Y510p, where's the Y710p? I guess us 17 inch people are in the minority. Finally, if you google laptop ratings laptop mag gave lenovo I think #2 spot for 2013 so that helped with pre-purchase confidence."

AGEKABQRGZCLYM4M2UDDFKNTCYBA,B003ZX8B3W,2,8,True,"We used Microsoft Streets and Trips with GPS for our GPS needs around the western US for 3 years.  It did a wonderful job with only a few drawbacks.  I would probably still be driving around LA if we didn't have it.  The biggest problem with it is that it requires a laptop to use.  Laptops are difficult to handle in the car and they are hard to use walking the streets of NYC.  So we got the Nuvi 1490LMT to replace it because of the portability issue.<br /><br />The Nuvi 1490LMT is well made and has a clear, bright screen that presents information in a good, simple and informative format.  Once used to the interface, it was easy and fun to use.  I like the eco data it accumulates and using it I challenged myself to be a better, more economical driver by getting better scores everytime I get in the car.  Although there a few issues with that, overall it is very good.  Setting up routes, etc. is easy.  Keyboard input is intelligent and offers an array of selections after a few letters are typed.  There are a lot of nice features that make it an interesting traveling companion.<br /><br />My big problem with the unit is the real reason for, not for the bells and whistles, getting a GPS - to show you how to get somewhere.  The 1490LMT does a pretty pitiful job of doing that.  I am, of course, comparing it to Streets and Trips, so my standards are high.  The 1490LMT sets up totally unrealistic routes most of the time.  Last night I set it up to take us to a pizza restaurant on a route that was pretty straightforward and LMT1490 directed us through a neighborhood off the main road for some reason.  It is possible I have it set up incorrectly or need a map update or something.  Whatever it is I am unhappy with the unit."

Instructions are near-unintelligible; take it slow and re-“read” whatever Amazon considers “help” in their instructions before mounting. A few tips:<br /><br />1. Pay attention to the direction that the large mount needs to be mounted on the wall. Arrow goes “up!”  You’d think it obvious, but it isn’t and the instructions are useless with this.<br /><br />2. Pay attention to the sidedness of the small mount that screws onto the TV. Logo faces inwardC not outward!  The large mount will not connect with the smaller mount unless the facing is correct. Make sure there is a “space” to hook the large mount to the small mount before trying.<br /><br />3. Do not listen to the “eye level” instructions on the template. This assumes that your small mount is centered on the back of your TV, which is not necessarily true. See where the mounts line up and adjust as appropriate. Be careful, or you will mount your TV too high, like I did, with no way to fix the error without a complete reinstall.<br /><br />It’s a decent mount but this isn’t beginner-friendly despite the reviews.

Packaging from Amazon, however,  which entailed putting the manufacturers box in a bigger box and stuffing a little crumpled paper in the void as filler was very substandard. Luckily the manufacturer sandwiched the PC between form fitting polystyrene, or judging by the poked holes in the outer box, the computer would have been completely ruined.<br /><br />The computer came with a USB keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is quite sturdy and branded HP. There were scratch marks on the side cover where an obvious monitor had sat (pc can be used sideways or upright like a normal tower). Other than the superficial marks, the inside of the computer was absolutely pristine. I am not sure if the manufacturer replaced the HD, but it looked like it was new and was branded as a Western Digital Blue model, which is far better than some brands. The HD included a copy of Windows 7 Pro and activated without incident. There is zero bloatware on the system, a nice bonus over buying a new system from HP!<br /><br />So, why didn't I rate this as 5 stars?<br /><br />When I first booted the system upon delivery, the HP splash logo came up, but the system froze and refused to even access the BIOS. After numerous restarts, and fruitlessly searching for answers on the internet, I broke down and called SJ Computers, the refurbisher. I was actually expecting a message, VM, anything except getting a live person on the second ring. I explained my problem and he said his &#34;tech&#34; was on the other line and could he call me back? Yeah, I thought that is the last I am going to hear from these guys, and started contemplating whether I should call Amazon for a refund or go through the replacement game. Khan, the &#34;tech&#34; called me back in less than 10 minutes. I patiently explained the problem, and his response was that UPS handles the packages roughly and that I should &#34;unplug everything for a couple of hours.&#34;<br />I didn't think that was the solution, and expressed that to Khan who said that was his recommendation and if it did not work to call him later. I am not sure if he really thought that would work, or was just trying to put off really digging into the issue. I will give SJ kudos for answering the phone and the quick call-back, but a real thumbs down for the &#34;tech&#34; advice. It did, however, jog my memory of another pc that stuck at the openong splash screen many years ago in the days of win 95.<br /><br />That is when I proceeded to open the case and fiddle with the innards. I remember that the OS needed to be disassociated from the BIOS. As I mentioned, the HD with the OS was deep under the power supply. To my surprise, the whole power supply also pivots up and out of the way without a single screw needing to be undone! I unplugged the HD, rebooted the system and was able to get into the BIOS. I changed the boot order from the CD ROM to the SATA HD as the first option. I then re-plugged the HD into the motherboard and it booted up to Win 7. The problem, obviously, was that after installing a new copy of win 7 the refurbisher forgot to change the boot order back to HD first...which is normally not a problem, but then PCs are strange creatures at the best of times.<br /><br />It is now the jukebox I always imagined having.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this little gem of a computer for just a little over a $100 shipped, it is a steal.

Mine worked without incident.<br /><br />There is one external sound jack for output (1 in and 2 combo headphone/mic jacks on the front) and so it was a snap to plug in a mini jack to two male RCA jacks that were attached to my amplifier...the sound through my two new POLK tower (T50) speakers is awesome. I also attached a cordless keyboard with built in track-pad and a WiFi dongle for internet access through my home network into two of the 10 ! USB ports.<br /><br />The system specs were as advertised: An Intel Core Duo running at 3.00ghz and 4GB Ram ( 4x1GB) and the previously mentioned 250 GB HD.<br /><br />5 Stars to Amazon for the free shipping that got here in 2 days from ordering! Packaging from Amazon, however,  which entailed putting the manufacturers box in a bigger box and stuffing a little crumpled paper in the void as filler was very substandard. Luckily the manufacturer sandwiched the PC between form fitting polystyrene, or judging by the poked holes in the outer box, the computer would have been completely ruined.<br /><br />The computer came with a USB keyboard and mouse. The keyboard is quite sturdy and branded HP. There were scratch marks on the side cover where an obvious monitor had sat (pc can be used sideways or upright like a normal tower). Other than the superficial marks, the inside of the computer was absolutely pristine. I am not sure if the manufacturer replaced the HD, but it looked like it was new and was branded as a Western Digital Blue model, which is far better than some brands. The HD included a copy of Windows 7 Pro and activated without incident. There is zero bloatware on the system, a nice bonus over buying a new system from HP!<br /><br />So, why didn't I rate this as 5 stars?<br /><br />When I first booted the system upon delivery, the HP splash logo came up, but the system froze and refused to even access the BIOS. After numerous restarts, and fruitlessly searching for answers on the internet, I broke down and called SJ Computers, the refurbisher. I was actually expecting a message, VM, anything except getting a live person on the second ring. I explained my problem and he said his &#34;tech&#34; was on the other line and could he call me back? Yeah, I thought that is the last I am going to hear from these guys, and started contemplating whether I should call Amazon for a refund or go through the replacement game. Khan, the &#34;tech&#34; called me back in less than 10 minutes. I patiently explained the problem, and his response was that UPS handles the packages roughly and that I should &#34;unplug everything for a couple of hours.&#34;<br />I didn't think that was the solution, and expressed that to Khan who said that was his recommendation and if it did not work to call him later. I am not sure if he really thought that would work, or was just trying to put off really digging into the issue. I will give SJ kudos for answering the phone and the quick call-back, but a real thumbs down for the &#34;tech&#34; advice. It did, however, jog my memory of another pc that stuck at the openong splash screen many years ago in the days of win 95.<br /><br />That is when I proceeded to open the case and fiddle with the innards. I remember that the OS needed to be disassociated from the BIOS. As I mentioned, the HD with the OS was deep under the power supply. To my surprise, the whole power supply also pivots up and out of the way without a single screw needing to be undone! I unplugged the HD, rebooted the system and was able to get into the BIOS. I changed the boot order from the CD ROM to the SATA HD as the first option. I then re-plugged the HD into the motherboard and it booted up to Win 7. The problem, obviously, was that after installing a new copy of win 7 the refurbisher forgot to change the boot order back to HD first...which is normally not a problem, but then PCs are strange creatures at the best of times.<br /><br />It is now the jukebox I always imagined having.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this little gem of a computer for just a little over a $100 shipped, it is a steal. If you want something to surf the net, listen to music, or even play older games on. It does use the Intel q45 shared graphics on the motherboard, but has a slot that can be used for a discrete graphics card if games are your thing. Just keep in mind it might need a little finessing to get working correctly...if you are a computer novice, maybe hold out for something a little newer."

AFMEACBLBPWYGNAR4VQLSI2WMX7Q,B00UNDF7AC,4,17,True,"This device isn't perfect for me, but the device perfect for me costs about 3 times as much as I paid for this $299.99, because it is extremely portable, and I'm able to fit it in a very small sling pack, and unlike other convertibles / 2-in-one tablet/laptops, the mechanism that holds the tablet in place is stable enough I can use it in my lap, even leaning backwards at an angle (see photo) and feel comfortable that the tablet isn't going to detach from the keyboard dock and end up on the floor.<br /><br />For me, portability, and screen resolution better than the stock WXGA (1366 x 768) which basically every other Windows-based option I explored at this point ($400 or less) has.  This screen has a beautiful, full HD 1080P (1920 x 1200, in fact) IPS display, which means that I can do my work on the go without sacrificing the need for all the tools on my screen, since my desktop at work is hooked up to screens with full 1080P 1920 x 1080 resolution.<br /><br />Speed isn't great, but adequate, and since I mostly use this to connect to my work VPN and then Remote Desktop to an RDP session on my work computer, it is quite acceptable.  Installing things can sometimes feel a little slow, but if you keep the system lean and don't run too many programs at once and watch what you install since some programs install a host of &#34;helper&#34; apps that run in the background even when you're not running the main program, the 2GB RAM and 1.33 GHz four-core Intel Atom processor is fine.<br /><br />I can't speak to video since I don't use this for video, but for Office, Remote Desktop, and basic web browsing, all of which I found worked quite fine.<br /><br />The keyboard definitely takes getting used to because the keys are a bit cramped, and I find I have to adjust how I type when working on this, but again, just the fact that I have a physical keyboard and not a membrane keyboard, or worse typing on glass, makes me instantly productive and is worth the trade-off, for me.<br /><br />The touchpad is similarly less than stellar, but once I adjusted my expectations, I found it, again, quite adequate, and worth the trade-off given the portability and screen.<br />Pros:<br />* Size and weight are stellar, fits in my very small sling pack<br />* Screen is absolutely stunning.  Full HD 1080p (1920 x 1200) on a tiny display, IPS for great viewing angles.<br />* Keyboard docking mechanism is very sturdy and screen feels locked in when used as a laptop<br />* It runs Windows 10 (8.1 preinstalled, 10 for free and fully supported by Lenovo), so full Office 2016<br />* 64GB eMMC storage is actually quite good at this price point for what is essentially a lightweight Windows utility<br /><br />Cons:<br />* Keyboard: keys are cramped, and typing comfortably requires adjustment.<br />* Touchpad: no right-click with two-finger tap common other touchpad; you have to click-down on right bottom of touchpad<br />* Touchpad: No two-finger scrolling, though scrolling with screen usually an easy way to get around this<br />* Processor: Adequate for basic browsing, Office, but if you open too many tabs or have too many programs loaded, can become slow to respond<br />* Memory: 2GB adequate for basic use (like processor), but same caveats apply here as for processor above<br /><br />The dock is sturdy and I felt very comfortable using it on my lap.<br /><br />Battery life isn't stellar, about 6 hours, but for me its the perfect niche for which I wanted it:  a super-tiny, very light Windows 10 laptop (I upgraded for free immediately upon setup since it prompted me as part of the setup, from Windows 8.1) with adequate power to run real Microsoft Office 2016, connect to my work network and Remote Desktop there to do my real work, and accomplish all the basic stuff I do through a web browser, all on a screen that I can stack a LOT on to -- thanks to my good eyes, since I only scale text and UI components to 125% of the native size, and not the default 150% which is probably what most normal humans using this will keep.  And I only need it for 4-5 hours of work on the go, anyway, so the battery life is fine -- when I need 8+ hours, I take my Chromebook, which is also wonderful but also doesn't fit in my tiny sling pack."

AEIGWFTW2LLIEJ55RAIFXN6BWACQ,B00F4MEHK8,5,0,True,"I am not a big fan of laptops. However, I will be doing a bit of traveling this coming year and am not willing to put my desktop work station at risk so I have decided on getting a laptop.  My uses are primarily web browsing and using programs such as Visual Studio and Intellij IDEA to build applications.  And, although I could have probably chosen something a bit less expensive, this laptop does what I need very well.<br /><br />Part of what probably makes this laptop a little more expensive is its solid build quality and the touchscreen on it.  Both of which I consider important features in our day and age.  The battery is also fantastic compared to past laptops (about 6 to 8 hours of sifting through the web and running some miscellaneous programs).  And, something I appreciate is how quickly the laptop boots up or wakes up from sleep - a sign of a good hard drive!  In addition, I must say that the touch screen is very quick to respond and follow, I can imagine using a stylus to take legible notes or draw with this laptop!  The bluetooth and wifi signals are also quite reliable. So, overall the laptop is very fast, responsive, and overall well built.<br /><br />Now as an aside, I get the impression that this particular Dell model was not in production for very long, however I have yet to find a reason why over the course of the month I have owned it. Being a 2013 model, this laptop has OpenGL 4.3 and DirectX 11 driver support (at the time of this review), so it is also pretty video game capable.  Me and my friends often enjoy playing local games of Civilization 5 and this laptop performs fine.  Final Fantasy XIV (14) is also installed on my laptop.  I am able to play the FFXIV on the game's lowest settings with 25-45 fps - not ideal but definitely acceptable.  And, the laptop may have performed better if it had more than an i3 processor, because the processor is typically the first part on this laptop to hit 100% when performing most tasks.  But, I also have to draw the line somewhere ($400).  Believe it or not, the touchscreen was more important to me than an i5 processor!  Hmm, come to think of it another great selling point is the lack of heat.  This laptop rarely heats up.  The fans almost never come on, and when they do they are very very subtle.  Which means the laptop is pretty good at being set on nonideal surfaces (your lap or other cloth surfaces).  But, I do have one negative remark about this laptop.  The keyboard and touchpad are finicky about key combinations.  A lot of the time when I press 'ctrl + f' to do a search the laptop will not respond.  Or while holding some keys in, the touchpad becomes unresponsive.  Perhaps I notice this issue more because I do not carry an external mouse with me.<br /><br />So in the end, even though I think Intel processors are over priced on desktops, I will never suggest an AMD laptop again after this experience!"

AEEHTVQZII3JT7MJIUWURMYV5TCQ,B01950TCEU,5,195,True,"Came for the 4K, stayed for the stabilization!<br /><br />The Balanced Optical SteadyShot (B.O.S.S.) image stabilizer on this thing is phenomenal for handheld shooting, best I've ever seen. Supposed to be slightly better in HD mode than 4K, but I didn't notice a significant difference. You can walk while shooting in wide angle, or zoom in all the way while standing still, and get usable to great footage -- no tripod necessary. Of course, you can't do swish pans and fling the camera around and expect miracles, but if you at least make an *attempt* to help it out by smoothing and dampening your motions or bracing yourself (like any decent cameraperson would), you can get unexpectedly great results.<br /><br />Yes, the AX100 has the much bigger 1&#34; sensor. But that model is now about 3 years old and about $700 more, while this camera has the very latest (2016) vastly improved optical stabilizer technology. Since I'm shooting lots of handheld documentary footage, often in remote locations with only occasional tripod shots, I opted for the better stabilizer rather than the bigger sensor and am VERY glad I did.<br /><br />Requires a fast SDXC card -- I used this SanDisk Extreme Pro 128GB UHS-1/U3 card with no problems: [[ASIN:B00NP63Y4K SanDisk Extreme PRO 128GB UHS-I/U3 SDXC Flash Memory Card with up to 95MB/s- SDSDXPA-128G-G46]]. You can fit about 2.5 hours of 4K @ 100mbps in XAVC-S mode on this card, more than double that for only HD resolution.<br /><br />I can report that the XAVC-S video from this camera works GREAT as-is when imported directly to iMovie 10.1 or greater on the Mac. I was pleasantly surprised -- you don't need a top-of-the line machine for basic 4K editing, my 2012 MacBook Air with an SSD does OK, and anything newer with an SSD should be even better. You do NOT need any scammy 3rd-party XAVC-S transcoding software, which you will find plenty of links to if you are googling around for AX53 and XAVC-S. I just mounted the SDXC card in my computer, clicked Import in iMovie 10.1.2, selected some clips, and could start viewing and editing them right away. The 4K video looks GREAT on a calibrated HD monitor and TV downscaled to 1080p. Update: finally got the chance to view it on a large calibrated 4K monitor, and yes you really can tell the difference; you don't perceive it as 4x more detail, but finely textured areas definitely seem more lifelike and tactile than in 1080p.<br /><br />The camera has some features for transferring video wirelessly, but that looked like a lot of trouble to me. I like simple things: just pop the card out, and stick it in your computer.<br /><br />Reading reviews, people kept complaining about two main things with this camera: not enough manual controls, and some kind of &#34;bug&#34; with the stabilizer when shooting on a tripod. Actually, I really like the Manual button, you can use it to choose which ONE of about 6 settings the lens ring controls, and you can do that from just the viewfinder (no touchscreen necessary). I wish I had 3 manual buttons like you do on the AX100, but I'll live. I also used the &#34;My Button&#34; feature to put 3 quick-access &#34;soft buttons&#34; always on the left side of the touchscreen: White Balance, Spot Focus, and Audio Rec Level. That's enough to remind me to take care of those things before every shot. As for the stabilizer &#34;bug&#34;, I didn't see it. For moving shots on a tripod (live panning and tilting with a fluid head) you want to turn SteadyShot off, otherwise it will fight you -- same with any lens that has optical image stabilization. But for locked-down tripod shots I didn't bother turning SteadyShot off and didn't notice any problems.<br /><br />Focusing system is fast in reasonable light -- when picking a target on touchscreen (Spot Focus), it goes from infinity to a foot away in less than a second. When in auto-focus mode and moving around, the camera actually takes its time and waits for things to settle down a bit before selecting a target, which I liked.<br /><br />When shooting, I start out by putting the camera in &#34;full auto&#34; mode with the little &#34;iAuto&#34; icon on lower right of screen (SONY calls it &#34;Intelligent Auto&#34;), which resets everything to auto while the camera tries to figure out a scene mode, exposure, shutter speed, etc. Then if necessary I make a few manual changes: white balance (using a white card), focus (using touchscreen or manual dial), and sound level. I observe the on-screen guides for Focus Peaking and Zebra Stripes. If I see too many zebra areas, I press and hold the Manual button for a second, pick the Exposure setting in the on-screen menu, and dial it down a little. That's about it -- but for quick run-and-gun the camera does a surprisingly good job when in iAuto mode, even in low light, and always with that great stabilizer.<br /><br />I use external mics exclusively, and the audio quality has been excellent: Rode VideoMic GO (powered by camera) or Rode Wireless Filmmaker Kit (transmitter, receiver, and lapel mic).<br /><br />I love the Time Lapse feature -- but unfortunately it stores the frames as individual 4K JPEGs rather than a movie, which means you have to use external software before importing to iMovie or whatever. I use the free Mac app called &#34;Interval&#34; (from the App Store) - pick an input folder with all the frames, pick your output settings, export as 4K QuickTime movie, then import that into iMovie. You don't need the SONY PlayMemories Home software for ANYTHING.<br /><br />This is a great hobbyist/prosumer camera for getting into 4K/UHD shooting, small and lightweight, feels very comfortable in your palm for on-the-go situations, and can yield amazing footage with a little care."

AGZKBWDZRLERRAOJXM3OMEZDOFNQ,B00KHUUPJ4,4,4,False,"As always, I did a lot of research before making this purchase. I didn't think it possible a few months ago, but I recently found myself wanting a convertible with a larger screen than my Asus Transformer TX300 has. There are some newer entries into the 15&#34; convertible arena all with about the same specs, but the Sony seemed to have the best design. I spent some time at Best Buy doing my hands on comparisons and durability tests, but did not buy from them because their extended warranties are not as good as Sony's are. I ended up purchasing direct from Sony with the 3 year extended warranty and accident coverage.<br /><br />The device is heavy for what it is. My wife's HP Spectre XT 15 is lighter. I can hold it in tablet mode, but not for too long. I've taken to placing it in presentation mode on my lap so I can use it as a tablet (without the keyboard in the way) and not hold it. The model I purchased has 12GB ram, Nvidia graphics and a 1TB spinning hard drive. In my research, some reviewers mentioned the hard drive was bringing down the overall performance results of tests, so I replaced mine with a Samsung 840 Pro SSD. I ran a PCMark 7 test and received a result of 4558 as opposed to 3562 before the drive swap. So, there was quite an improvement, but it's still below where I'd like to see it. In comparison, my TX300 tablet scored a 4577 on the same test.<br /><br />Many reviewers also mentioned the unstable single channel wifi. While I had it apart replacing the hard drive, I swapped in an Intel dual channel card and after a driver update I have strong, fast and stable wifi.<br /><br />I've been using the device for a couple of days and overall I'm happy with it. The screen is probably the best part of it. It's very crisp, colorful and bright. Everyday work and play seems more enjoyable and movies are something to see on this screen. I was having some issue with my first touch not registering, it got better after I calibrated the touchscreen, but it still happens from time to time. I'm hoping a driver update is in the works to address this. The Ntrig pen is a great feature. I haven't had the opportunity to draw much with it, but the handwriting is excellent. I tend to hold it in my hand and use a combination of pen and touch as if it were a natural thing to do. The device has no option for storing the pun, so I ordered a clip from Targus for it which seems to work just fine. The overhang design of the sides does make it awkward getting to ports, but it's not too much of an inconvenience. During my initial run of updates and software installs, I did it on a full charge and unplugged. I was basically pushing the device the entire time and got about 4.5 hours out of it. I'd like to see a longer run time and believe that under normal, less demanding conditions I will see over 6 hours.<br /><br />Sony includes a lot of software with the device for drawing and editing music and video. Some may call this bloatware, but it's quality software that can be valuable if you put it to use. Other bloatware is at a minimum and easily removed.<br /><br />I haven't seen any real issues with it yet and it appears to be fairly quick at start up and performing tasks. I think it will be a good device for some time to come. However, I'm uncertain about any potential warranty claim now that Sony has made the decision to get out of the computer market. Hopefully I won't ever have to find out."
AGZKBWDZRLERRAOJXM3OMEZDOFNQ,B009WG6MXM,5,4,True,"My wife's aging (2 year old) Samsung developed a problem with the charging port and the repair would have been a few hundred dollars, so I decided to upgrade as an anniversary present. I researched for a very long time before making my decision. I had a few ""must haves"" that I was looking for;<br /><br />1. touch screen<br />2. Windows 8<br />3. Intel i7<br />4. ultrabook<br />5. 15 inch screen<br /><br />There's currently not a lot of options out there for all of that. I wanted to wait for the Asus U500VZ, but you never know when Asus is actually going to release an announced product and all indications are that it'll cost $2500 when released, so the search was on. I saw the 13 inch Spectre XT and liked it, but it was lacking the larger screen. I came across this one and it seemed to match all of my criteria, so I ordered it.<br /><br />Ok, right off, and most importantly, the wife loved it at first sight. It is a striking machine, even more so in person than the pictures. In fact, in the 15 inch category, it's the most beautiful laptop out there right now. It powers up incredibly fast and runs faster than any computer in the house, including my custom built gaming desktop. We've been using Android tablets daily for months, so Windows 8 was almost natural. It's a combination of the touch type tablet interface and Windows 7. Not difficult at all.<br /><br />We did a comparison of screen quality side by side with our tablets, laptops, desktop and HDTV's. This screen blows them ALL away. it's incredible in it's depth and clarity. Colors are true to life and rich, no complaints here what so ever. The viewing angle is so much better than anything else. You don't lose image quality no matter what angle you look at it from. Touch response is on par, if not better than our tablets and so far, finger prints aren't an issue.<br /><br />I did have to update the wireless drivers to keep a steady connection, so keep that in mind. And, as with all computing devices, I had to spend some time updating Windows and deleting bloatware. My advice would be to delete the included Norton virus software and activate your Windows defender. Norton is a virus in itself. Kuddos to Microsoft for their handling of Office. I purchased Office 2007 many years ago, but this device doesn't have a CD drive. I went to getmicrosoftoffice.com, entered my activation code, downloaded and installed my version for free.<br /><br />Sound quality. This laptop has 4 speakers and includes the much hyped Beats audio. I can say, for a laptop, the sound quality is good and it can get VERY loud. I wouldn't say the quality is great overall though. I think most people will be very happy with it.<br /><br />My one complaint so far would be the touch pad. It's nice looking frosted glass, but the one piece design leaves a lot to be desired. It's difficult to hit the right and left buttons and sometimes requires several pushes to work. We have  gotten used to just reaching up and touching the screen instead of using the touch pad.<br /><br />We're still getting to know this laptop, but so far it is the best piece of technology we have ever owned. It's relatively light weight, beautiful in design and extremely powerful. I recommend it very highly.<br /><br />***UPDATE 6/8/13***<br /><br />Last week, my wife opened the lid one morning and we both heard a ""snap"". Soon after she said the touch wasn't working on the right side of the screen. Upon investigation, I found the lower right corner of the glass covering the LCD was cracked through on a diagonal. Presumably that was the ""snap"" we heard. Since it was beyond the return period for Amazon, I contacted HP. They sent a box overnight and I shipped the unit off for warranty repair. A couple days later they called and said they believed the damage to be customer related and denied the warranty claim. Repair would be over $400 out of pocket. This was rediculous and I refused.<br /><br />I went on the HP website and noted others had experienced the same issue. I posted my experience and within 5 minutes was contacted by an HP rep. After some email correspondence, he said their engineers wanted my laptop for investigation and they would ship a new one to me. I'm currently waiting on the replacement (5-14 days).<br /><br />We love this laptop and felt so strong about HP's quality and design that we also purchased an ElitePad. Initially we were very disappointed with the warranty service and thought we'd made a mistake going with HP, but HP did step up and take care of this. I commend them for resolving the issue to my satisfaction, but wish it had been taken care of without so much effort.<br /><br />***UPDATE 06/15/2013***<br />The replacement unit arrived. I restored using the Windows utility and you really can't tell any difference between the two. However, I am concerned because the glass is not completely flush all the way around the bezel. Given my experience so far this concerns me. But, HP is offering a 2 year warranty, hope to never have to take advantage of it.<br /><br />Because this was resolved, my initial review remains unchanged and our faith in HP has been restored."
AGZKBWDZRLERRAOJXM3OMEZDOFNQ,B004M9NZIO,5,2,True,"Bought this because my Samsung RC512 was telling me the same card that came stock in it was not installed. Thought the card had gone bad. After ordering, I decided to uninstall and reinstall the latest drivers and that solved my problem. I'll keep this one as a back up. Now, for the review. I've had many laptops and currently have 3 in my house. The Samsung with this card is by far the fastest and had the greatest reception. I also like the fact that I have onboard WiMax although I've cancelled my Sprint service and don't currently use it, nice to have it available. I did pop this card in my wife's Gateway just to see if it would work and it will for wifi only (no WiMax) with greater signal strength. I'd highly recommend it to anyone replacing a current wifi card. Just remember you need an Intel chipset, not ATI to get full benefit of it's features."

AE67QJNP5M62QO5CPAGESPMDLSIQ,B004YE8G6I,1,2,True,"It's good when it works. I don't do any gaming. I just wanted an upgrade from my onboard Intel video so that I could use a DVI connection to my screen, since the onboard only has analog. This Radeon produces a nice picture, but the GPU frequently locks up, writing kernel debug messages to the system log. When it locks up, usually the system can recover so that the display at least works, but the GPU stops accelerating, so the display is extremely slow, until rebooting. Sometimes when the GPU locks up, the system cannot recover, so I have to ssh to the system and reboot it. This GPU lockup problem happens about once a week, on average. Besides the log messages, I can tell when the GPU croaks by observing a significant drop in temperature, according to the GPU's temperature sensor, as read by lm-sensors. It will do this, seemingly randomly, even when nobody is using the computer, it's just idle with the screen asleep. I'm not sure if it's a buggy driver causing the problem (I'm using the free radeon module), or shoddy hardware; I'm inclined to say it's the latter."
AHRYIN4NVVTDXGTXCB7AI6WVAESQ,B00889ST2G,5,22,True,"Camera technology is advancing at a staggering pace. We've reached a point where amateur users can pick up a compact point and shoot camera and take shots rivaling those of a fullsized SLR of just 5 years ago. The RX100 is that camera. I myself was lugging around a Sony Alpha A57, which is a current generation SLR. I found that as a casual user despite the features and detachable lens capability I just didn't want to carry a camera bag around with me everywhere. I even left it at home on a trip to europe, opting to take shots with an iphone instead, how sad!<br /><br />The RX100 is a close to perfect camera for someone who wants SLR quality photos without having to carry around a large camera an several lenses. In my opinion the best features are:<br /><br />Picture quality-20 MP and a 1"" sensor makes for really nice pics.<br />Lens-The zoom is impressive for a camera if this size<br />Shooting mode-The intelligent auto+ mode takes any guesswork out of most shooting situations, picking the best mode.<br />Control-The camera will shoot in manual mode and raw format if you're not an entirely casual user.<br />Video-1080p, the quality is very good.<br /><br />So, cons? There are a few:<br /><br />Price-Yes, you're paying a premium for a pocket point and shoot, the price of an entry level SLR camera in fact.<br />Size-Yes it's a 'pocket' camera. If you're wearing baggy jeans. If you're a skinny jeans wearing hipster forget about it, or forget about putting anything else in your pocket. Goes fine in a jacket though.<br />Flash-Not that the flash doesn't work, but it's a popup that's right where your left index finger will sit when taking shots. A little annoying.<br />Charging-No external charger for the battery, really Sony? I have to plug in the camera to charge a battery? What if I want to leave one charging while I'm out and about?<br /><br />Other than that it's hard to find fault with this camera. It takes better pics than a camera this size has any business taking. I just wish I had this camera a few months earlier and saved myself the iphone shots around Prague."

If you have a cover that only opens one way you cannot use a stand, or easily use the tablet, when charging it.<br />- The speed with a 1.8 Atom does not allow for laptop, especially desktop, use.  There is not enough CPU or RAM room to run more than 1 program at one time.  If the one program you do use a RAM/CPU intensive program (Office programs for example) it is slow and unresponsive.  You have to continually wait for the program to ""catch up"".<br />- Dell Backup and Recovery software continually crashes, I've been unable to use it.<br />- DVI-Out does not work easily.  You have to find a sweet spot after plugging in the adapter, it takes a couple of minutes of ""fiddling"".<br />- Intel Video adapter only supports 16:9 screens.  For my 16:10 monitor it is fairly unusable.<br /><br />Windows does not belong on a tablet.<br /><br />There are no amount of expletives that would capture my hatred of Windows 8. You will find frustration after frustration.  Even navigating to the Control Panel is a Minotaur's Labyrinth of pain and forget about running from the Command Prompt.<br /><br />There are 2 sides of Windows 8, the Tile Side and the Desktop side.  Most of the Tile side programs simply go to the desktop where you will try to navigate through tapping, only to close the program half the time because the the operation buttons are so small.<br /><br />There are few apps that utilize only the Tile side and you continually have to sign in to use any of them, including SkyDrive. This is the process for retrieving a document from SkyDrive: Sign-in to the Tablet.  Sign-in to Skydrive (on a popup every time you start the tablet), download the document and if you want to edit the document you have to sign in again to your Live account. Microsoft's inability to provide security has rested on the labor of its users by continually having to sign in.<br /><br />Another note on SkyDrive, I was fairly horrified to open my Outlook.com account and be able to view any file (C: Drive) on my tablet and my synced Laptop.<br />If I was an admin that cared about security I could see no easy way to use SkyDrive or Windows 8.  You have to have a Live account to do anything from the Tile side, which of course signs you up for SkyDrive.<br /><br />I'm still weighing, if possible, whether to send this back.  If I hadn't received it for half price (refurbished and a Dell coupon) and received a free stylus, AC Charger and DVI adapter it would have gone back the same day.<br /><br />UPDATE 1 -<br />2 notes. I'm actually liking Windows better, opening 2 programs on a tablet is nice.<br />I now hate the tablet itself-The SD Card reader is broken after 2 uses and the graphics card is so poor Google Earth can't be used.<br /><br />UPDATE 2 -<br />Once again the tablet has to be sent in for repairs.  While watching a video the speakers blew out and are now not functional. Another video card note - the HDMI Out does not put out a wide screen setting.

I've had this very laptop purchased from this seller for 2 days and I LOVE it! It might help you to know that it runs Minecraft on all the highest settings very smoothly. It also runs Skyrim on High very smoothly. I tried ultra, and while it does run, it can be a little jerky. No matter, you can't tell a difference between those two settings anyway.  It also comes with Windows 7 which I'm very pleased about. The sound is SUPERB! Best sound I've ever had out of a laptop. I'm a tech geek, so I've had plenty of computers.  This laptop also has excellent microphone sound IF you plug a microphone in. The onboard mic is passable if you need to skype someone or something, but it's not great. No onboard mics really are.  Also the soundcard on this laptop DOES have stereo mix. That was important for me to know because I'm a sing and plug a mixer into my laptop to record my music.  All in all it is a fantastic laptop.<br /><br />Con: The only con I've found is the fan is pretty loud compared to other laptops I've seen. But it doesn't get very hot, so that is worth the sound.<br /><br />I would buy it again and at this price point (currently under one hundred dollars) it is the best value you will find for a gaming laptop.

Now I should have said no you are the tech, you do it. But I didn't. Today I called back and said I'm pretty sure it's the graphics card and they guy I spoke to said yeah it probably is and gave me an RMA number. Now I have had this laptop 1 month and it is under warranty for 2 more years and they are making ME pay shipping!

AHY4WV7PL4QRWHBPXPT4B6I4UMMA,B083MZSVFM,4,2,True,"I'm currently using this with a pair of 4K 60Hz monitors, both of which support HDR and FreeSync (more on this in a moment). A USB keyboard and mouse, both gaming hardware, are connected to the KVM. As for devices, I have an iVANKY dual USB C dock for an Intel MacBook Pro, which is producing dual HDMI outputs which feed the KVM. The secondary device is a traditional desktop computer, where the dual HDMI outputs are connected to an Nvidia RTX 3080. There are no other USB devices connected to the KVM.<br /><br />On the positive side, this setup almost always works perfectly. I did need to disable the low-latency mode on the keyboard in order to connect it to the keyboard port on the KVM, and this in turn is required if you want to use the keyboard shortcut to swap between inputs (which I do). This is unfortunate and noticeable, but otherwise not a big deal. Both the mouse and the keyboard appear to the connected computers as generic USB input devices, so I lose out on most of the gaming features of the mouse, but this isn't noticeable for the most part. The only annoying bit was bouncing back and forth between computers during initial setup, attempting to normalize the mouse acceleration between two different operating systems.<br /><br />Swapping time between inputs is right around 2-3 seconds, during which time the monitors go dark but inputs are respected. In practice, this is generally fine.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the experience is not *perfect*. The most common complaint that I have is infrequent instabilities which seem to stem from the switch. This has manifested as input device issues (e.g. mouse input being ignored), or even display issues (e.g. the left display being black, though still recognized as a display, and only on one of the input computers). In all cases, restarting the KVM resolves the issue, but it's an annoying step to have to take.<br /><br />Additionally, FreeSync doesn't work through HDMI. It's *possible* that I could do something tricky with HDMI-to-DisplayPort cables, but I haven't tried and I doubt that it would work. In general, if you're looking for a variable refresh rate solution, you're going to need a DP KVM rather than an HDMI solution. This is probably my only regret with this device.<br /><br />As a final complaint, I do wish that the low latency keyboard mode were supported. From the keyboard side, what this does is it cause the keyboard to emulate a USB hub with multiple connected keyboards, which in turn allows it to bypass the limitations on the USB Keyboard protocol. In theory, the KVM could respect this, but it would be challenging and I understand why it does not.<br /><br />Overall, I do recommend this device, but expect to have a certain number of annoying and random technical issues, usually resolved with power reset."

AHI32VBL6PV7FWBSMOITEZ4LR2AA,B01NASF1KD,5,6,False,"This is for the full TS3 dock, not the lite. I bought it directly from CalDigit, but posting a review here because this is the place I go to looking for reviews myself.<br /><br />I've only used the eSATA and ethernet ports so far. They work great. Basically it seems this little box (much smaller than it appears on the picture) contains a PCIe SATA controller, a PCIe ethernet controller - and given the displayport output, also an external graphics card! All are connected to your laptop by thunderbolt's external PCIe passthrough. Pretty nifty.<br /><br />To make this work under Linux you have to disable Thunderbolt Security in the BIOS. After that it is pretty much plug and play. At least on my Dell Precision 5510 system which is running kernel 4.12. The work is ongoing and Intel seems to make Thunderbolt code changes pretty much every kernel revision.<br /><br />Since the ethernet controller lives in the dock, your router will see you under a new MAC address: the MAC address lives in the NIC which is a part of the dock, not a part of your laptop.<br /><br />The SATA controller supports port multiplier - I run a 4 disk enclosure on it. At boot time I sometimes have to re-plug it a couple times till every disk is recognized by the OS. But they all seem to be like that, so no * deduction.<br /><br />Lastly, despite all the electronics inside there is no fan, so this system is silent."

AHONUQPBQVRBKDBMYANW4WUWR6BA,B0BKGM7XJ2,5,0,True,"Surprisingly I was impressed with this blower/vacuum.  I was not expecting a quality build but to my dismay it seems very well built and should last a long time. In addition to the material quality, the performance was as advertised. Finally no more throw away cans. Even the content packaging was impressive. The only negative that I can think of is the size of the instruction manual. While any half intelligent person can figure out how to turn on and operate the device, the attachments included can be slightly confusing and trying to read the manual is difficult at best. While re-watching several videos on the web it became more clear. Especially on the explanation on rotating the handle for different operations. The manual says turn the handle in a clockwise 180 degree rotation for blowing, but the picture clearly shows by arrows a counterclockwise rotation? After figuring out that this rotation did not alter or affect the operation, it apparently just was an adjustment for comfort and trigger operation when switching between blow and vacuum. Guess I should have figured that out sooner. Will edit this post later if I discover any problems."

So as part of my current passion project, I'm working on a nice sturdy low-profile E8400 Core 2 Duo with an LGA775 motherboard. I had just powered it up after being off a while when I heard this gawd-awful whirring noise and then it shut off. Turned out the stock CPU fan failed. So, I hopped onto Amazon and started looking for compatible replacement. I read a LOT of reviews here and other places, and finally settled on the Rockwell 80mm made specifically for low-profiles like mine.<br /><br />I was dreading the whole process. I can never get back the 60 minutes of my life when I had to last deal with my stock fan. I didn't swear that much when I was in labor! I silently prayed to the tech gods when I removed that #$%* Intel fan for the last time (took me 10 minutes just to wrestle it out). I then opened the Rockwell package and braced myself. I placed it over the 4 holes in the mother board... and pressed gently... and... and..<br /><br />Wait... what... THAT'S IT?!!!!<br /><br />No cursing, no sweating, no drama. I then just followed the arrows to lock it in, attached the power source, and done. I closed the case, plugged in the machine (yeah, goes without saying you should do all this unplugged) and powered it up. I heard nothing. And that's exactly how it should be.

AGUFRURUIR3CWUMSQPDKKPGLCOQQ,B00R1P9332,1,13,False,"To be clear, this is a review of this particular laptop and not Windows 8 or the box store I purchased it from (both of which are fine - better than fine , actually). There is a lot of hating on Acer that goes on on-line, and I thought, how can a laptop be that bad? It's got the same Intel processor and Microsoft software as all the others, why not get this one that is so much less expensive and does all I want?<br /><br />In the interest of fairness, I will say, I wanted so much to love this laptop. It was lightweight, had the cool 360 degree thing all the way to tablet mode, and the touch screen is absolutely the way to go with Windows 8. The problem was that it didn't work, and in subtle ways at first. The laptop was always unresponsive when booting up. It was necessary to hit enter or whatever key several times before getting to the login screen. Then, when switching to tent or tablet mode, the touch screen would become wonky - only letting me type in caps, opening a million new browser windows, or not working at all. Each time this happened, returning to normal laptop mode did not correct the issue, and a restart was required. So after a few days of this, I exchanged the laptop at another location (which was easy to do because I was well within my 15-day return policy period) for a new one - same type. The new one worked okay for about 5 weeks. I say &#34;okay&#34; and not &#34;great&#34; because there were still little issues - the unresponsive keyboard at startup, the &#34;g&#34; key not working properly after a couple of weeks, the issue where I couldn't connect to my wireless router when I returned home from being connected at work and had to reboot to make the computer connect. Finally, these little issues were overshadowed by the touchscreen ceasing to work at all. I had not really been trying to use it in other modes - turns out it's an awfully big tablet and not very appealing to use in that manner - but in simple laptop mode, it would work and then it wouldn't. When it didn't, the driver would disappear completely from the device manager. A chat with Acer support had me update my bios, which made things better for a couple of days, but then back to the nonworking touchscreen and the disappearing driver. Acer support chat had me do a factory reset (be prepared to give up a day to back up your data and then do the reset), and after that, the driver didn't load with the Windows software. After updates, it did load, but then there were the same issues in tablet and tent mode as with the first laptop. They told me I would have to mail it in (with at least a 3-week wait time) for repair.<br /><br />I went back to the box store (that I believe this model is specifically made for), despite being well past the 15-day return period, and since I had already been in for a touch screen issue, they let me exchange the machine for an entirely different laptop. There's also a lot of hating on the internet for this particular store, but I can only say nice things about their customer service. Anyhow, two laptops both with touchscreen issues, purchased in two different states, no less, indicates that that is an issue with this particular model. Add in the wireless connectivity issues, the flimsy keyboard, and the slow boot, and it's clear that this is not a well-made computer."

I wanted to replace the AR948 for two reasons, it did not have bluetooth and it was not a dual band card. I shopped hard for its replacement and settled upon the Intel 6235. As you can see with my five star rating I am happy with this card.<br /><br />First, the Intel card is exactly the same size as the AR948 and as such is an easy ""drop-in"" replacement. There was no messing around adding an additional antenna or having to modify my laptop to secure the Intel card. Disconnect the two antennas, remove a single screw, pop out the old card and pop in the new card, reconnect everything and BAM! Done deal. Once I booted into my ASUS A55A-AH31 the new card was detected and Windows 8.1 (x64) installed the proper drivers for both the WI-FI and Bluetooth. For such an inexpensive price I have upgraded my laptop with Bluetooth and Dual Band N with 5GHZ!<br /><br />My 5GHZ network was picked up with full bars and I connected to it at a full 300Mbps just as the specs are advertised for the card. Furthermore, I am not having any dropped signals and I spent a couple hours playing an intensive MMORPG with out a single hiccup.<br /><br />As for the bluetooth connection goes... I have as yet to connect a bluetooth device, but I am planning on using the connection soon! What I can say is that Windows 8.1 shows the hardware and I can control it in the PC settings area, turning it on and off. I'll try to give an update on the bluetooth once I have used it.<br /><br />Since I can't find anything wrong with the Intel 6235 at this time, I am giving it a full five stars. I am happy to have this easy upgrade for my laptop and at such an exceptional price.<br /><br />EDIT (12-11-2013): I tested the bluetooth with a pair of headphones today ([[ASIN:B00CBNG10C SoundBot® SB220 Bluetooth Noise-Cancellation Stereo Headphone ]]). Pairing the headphones to the Intel device was a snap. Connection was flawless. I had excellent range throughout the first floor of my house (about 750sq ft)."

AHN4VJU5I7OHUKKWA6FQ24XHJP5Q,B00H7Z7XA6,5,9,True,"I needed to build a budget system and wanted something fairly inexpensive.  I went with the 7700K mostly because I didn't want to buy a separate graphics card, and at some point may want to play a few games on the machine.  I have the APU paired with a Mushkin SSD and 2TB WD Green drive.  I've also used 16GB of DDR3 1866, so not as fast as it could be.  I am not using this system to run games so please keep that in mind.<br /><br />What are you buying?<br />The A10-7700K is a bit of an odd ball.  AMD wants to claim we get 10 Compute Cores, and what that means is that we get 4 CPU and 6 GPU cores.  This is important to note as other A10-7xxx APU's get 12.  They all have an additional 2 GPU cores.  So, if you want better graphics, please look at the 7850 or 7870 models.<br />What does the K mean, it means the multiplier on this APU is unlocked and you can overclock it.<br /><br />Performance.<br />I am very pleased.  My primary desktop is an FX-8350 and for normal operations such as web browsing, opening documents, pdf files, youtube, and other typical day to day activities I can not tell the difference.<br />Currently the machine is running Linux (Ubuntu 14.04) and hosting two virtual machines (each set up with two cores) on my home network.  The only time I've noticed any slow downs is if both VM's are under load.  Even then it could be the drive.<br /><br />Heat<br />IMPORTANT! Do Not use the stock Heat sync and fan if you plan to push this APU, even a little bit.  I used a fairly inexpensive Cooler Master Hyper TX3, also bought here on Amazon for a whooping $17.23 last month.  It does the job, I won't go into a lot of detail here as I have the case in a fairly confined space with three other machines and have not tested it with better air flow.<br /><br />Power draw.<br />This is a 95W TDP APU.  Expect that, if you want to get a lower power draw you may want to move to the A10-7800 at 65W or better yet the A8-7600 which is very similar to this one.<br /><br />Final notes.<br />This is not a bad processor at all.  It runs fast, and with the right cooler it doesn't get overly hot.  Real world numbers put it on par with an i3 from Intel, which is fine.  Realistically if I had tried to build an Intel system with the same budget I would have ended up with a Pentium or Celeron CPU and they don't even come close.  Add to that the thought that at some point I can actually use this to play some older games without having to go out and buy a graphics card and I'm very happy."

I know some people may mark it down for not offering a lot of overclocking options, but I don't overclock.<br />We have HDMI out which for some reason other boards in this price range leave off.<br />The board includes a legacy PCI slot, which is nice if you want to add an older but still usable PCI sound card or NIC.<br /><br />The Bad<br />The PCI-e x1 slot is too close to the x16 slot.  If you do put a graphics card in, even some single slot cards, you will lose access to the x1 slot.  I currently use that slot for an Intel gigabit NIC and later may want to add a graphics card either for gaming or folding at home and my choices will be limited by this.<br />The board includes a realtec gigabit connector.

Adding a PCI-e Intel NIC solved this.<br /><br />In closing<br />I've had the system up for a month running Ubuntu 14.04 and a couple virtual machines.

The audio is clear, the design is beautiful in person, the chick-let style keyboard is amazing to type on, windows 10 is very easy to learn, the computer is blazing fast, the screen is beautiful (not blown away tho), and the laptop overall is lightweight and thin and comfortable. When you lift it, there is no creaking, and it retains a solid feel. The power cord is thin and long and fits snug into its port. The grey and black color scheme is perfect and professional.

Two thumb screws open the case, and one more thumb screw holds the drive in place, which has to be one of the nicest 2.5"" SATA drive mounts I've seen.  Memory snaps in quick and easy.  The box looks nice, and has plenty of options for mounting, either flat, standing up, or attached to a monitor (or wall) using the included bracket.  All of that is really slick, and is what it shares with the Zbox ID41 that I purchased for myself previously.<br /><br />This time around, I purchased the ID12 because I didn't need the extra cost or power of the Ion graphics.  I was planning on setting this system up with a linux OS, running a simple application.  I had previously installed the same linux system (Fedora 15) and run the same application on an older Asus running the 1.6GHz Atom chip, so with the dual core 1.8GHz chip and more memory, I knew this system would have far more power than it needed.<br /><br />What I didn't expect was the great difficulty I would run into getting the system installed and running properly, which all came down to the on-chip GMA-3150 graphics.  To sum up my experience, the GMA-3150 graphics is designed for netbook use, and it assumes that anything you connect to the HDMI port is its laptop display.  That doesn't sound like a problem, but it doesn't work with the EDID information of your monitor, so it ignores all the capabilities of the monitor, and instead runs it at a reduced resolution which you can choose in the BIOS.  When I received the system, that resolution maxxed out at 1280x800.  After downloading and installing an available BIOS upgrade, I could set the resolution as high as 1366x768, still well short of the monitor I was connecting it to.  Connecting a monitor to the VGA output would work, and the EDID info of the monitor was used, so the monitor could run at native resolution, but the graphics see this as an external monitor on a laptop/netbook, and most OS's will not send the display here automatically.<br /><br />Intel's own diagram of the Atom architecture clearly illustrates the problem of running the GMA-3150 graphics in something other than a laptop with an integrated display:  [...]<br /><br />This ultimately became the downfall of this system for me -- I couldn't get Linux to ignore the HDMI output (which it thought was a laptop screen) and just send to the VGA output which was working right with the larger monitors.  I installed Windows to another drive, and discovered the same things (limited resolution display with no EDID on the HDMI port) although I was able to configure Windows to ignore the HDMI port.  So, if you are going to run Windows, or don't care about running at the full native resolution of your monitor, then this system might work for you.<br /><br />I contacted Zotac support, and got a response right away, but it was the generic ""check your drivers, use the drivers on the CD"" reply, (only Windows drivers on the CD, and the Intel drivers used in Fedora were not the issue) and when I followed up, I received no further reply at all, despite sending four separate emails.  That was very disappointing and resulted in me deciding to return the system.<br /><br />Thankfully, Amazon was great and handled the return with no fuss or issues.<br /><br />In conclusion, I love my ID41 with the same processor and Ion Next gen graphics, but do yourself a favor and skip this one.  The GMA-3150 graphics just are NOT designed to be used outside of a netbook/laptop application."

AGWL4Q363XLRCEXKJBYXEZYUP7PA,B087C5PR2Z,5,7,True,"Well, I have been trying for a couple of years to get decent sound in this room for a couple of years. Tried 2 different Samsung Soundbars with this TV and could never get adequate volume or voices without distortion. Both Samsung soundbars had the same issues as did the 3 Samsung TVs I own.<br /><br />As soon as I fired this system up on Tuesday, I knew for sure that room acoustics were not the issue. Samsung made very poor design choices. I will never buy another Samsung product as the only thing worse than the products was the customer service.<br /><br />I bought the Pro 7.1.4 model. This producte solved the volume and intelligibility issues with the default settings. Took some experimenting to get absolutely amazing performance. Bass I can feel, clear vocals without resorting to the clear voice feature, and once I figured out how to make it work properly beautiful surround performance. I had expected the surround to be other than excellent as there are no side speakers, just the SSE endgine and some side and up firing tweeters in the bar itself with some help from the rear speakers.<br /><br />The remote has a separate button for everything, so there are very few settings not available from a single button. This is good, because the display is very hard to read and the abbreviations are often incomprehensible. The display is one of the very few complaints I have about this unit. I can see it fine, but making sense of what I see is more than a little problematic.<br /><br />Possibly as a result of the years of problems I had with the Samsungs, I feel like this is simply the best audio product I have ever owned, and as a 76 year old audio fanatic, that covers an awful lot of products.<br /><br />While the manual is significantly better than most, some details are a little ambiguous. Yeah, I'm probably one of the few people on the planet who still reads manuals, and even if I am totally satisfied with the product (which I am), I want to understand the obscure details in canse I ever need to know them. Will likely call tech support if I can't figure it out on my own, and from the reviews I read before I bought this item, I'm guessing they will likely know the answers.<br /><br />Haven't had a reason to try the Bluetooth yet, so I didn't rate that but my other ratings on this item are all 5 stars. Can't imagine what I'm missing by not going with the more expensive versions, but I have to say I'm totally good with the 7.1.4 version I bought.<br /><br />I don't often rave about a product, but I'm raving about this one."
AGWL4Q363XLRCEXKJBYXEZYUP7PA,B06XNZDYH4,1,0,True,"Have owned this for a couple of years from day 1 the volume was way too low and the voice quality was often unintelligable. Have used it with 2 Samsung TVs with the same results. Trying to check if the TV was the issue, I tied the incoming signals to an HDMI switch which extracts the audio before it gets to the TV, but that didn't help either. Output from the switch via optical or analog produces the same results. Source material comes either from the YVs themselves via ethernet, a series of different Fire TV sticks and a Panasonic DVD player. Minimum usable volume (on the 0-99) for any program is 70, but most programs require the volume set into the 90s, and many programs can't be heard clearly with the volume cranked up to max. I'm looking to replace this with something else, but I really don't know what. Many programs from Amazon Prime, Hulu, Netflix and other sources suffer from voices which are unintelligible even when the volume is high enough for them to be audible. Have tried everything I can think of. Looking for a replacement with more sensitive inputs as this is just not adequate. Lived with it for so long because I didn't watch much TV as I was rarely home. Since Covid-19 I'm watching a lot of TV and this monster is a constant source of irritation."
AGWL4Q363XLRCEXKJBYXEZYUP7PA,B071ZVQVFQ,1,5,True,"Built in audio is horrible. Borders on unintelligible, so I got a Samsung sound bar. This gives excellent sound quality, but the output from the TV is very low and sometimes full volume is required.from the sound bar. But that's not the biggest audio issue. The biggest problem is that the sound drops randomly for a fraction of a second on both HDMI inputs. Haven't noticed it on the USB input, but I don't use that much so it may be there also. Seems to be worse with Bitstream, but is still a problem with PCI audio. I thought it was a source issue, but over the past few weeks I have had the time to do extensive testing with various sources. Same source did not have these glitches on other TVs, and all sources including DVD and streaming do have these problems. It's particularly bad on music whether it's CD sourced or from Pandora or Amazon music. Really seems to be a firmware issue rather than hardware, but it's tough to tell for sure. The self test built into the TV does not show an issue. Picture is fine, but the audio issues are too distracting to make this a viable TV."
AGWL4Q363XLRCEXKJBYXEZYUP7PA,B007TEH0LC,3,3,True,"This TV provides adequate picture quality, but you really have to work to get it. Start by turning off all of the automagic stuff, particularly the automagic correction for room lighting conditions. It's really impossible to get consistently decent pictures with all of the helpful automatics turned on. There are a lot of color/brightness/contrast controls and their functions are not adequately explained in the instruction manual. Add to that the fact that the instruction manual was obviously written by a non-native English speaker, and you have a real problem on your hands. It took about 2 weeks, but ultimately I was able to tweak the picture to a point where is provides a very pleasing image to my eye. But it wasn't easy to get there, and with the automatics on, the picture was simply terrible.<br /><br />Sound quality was equally troublesome. The fake surround sound it absolutely unintelligible with some signals. Once again, turning off all the fancy stuff and manually adjusting the equalizer seems to be the best option.<br /><br />Once you do all that, you've got a good basic 32 inch TV, but if you're not into tweaking, this is not the set for you.<br /><br />Does a very good job of showing video from  an 8 gig (max) thumb drive and also does a good job streaming video from Amazon. But many of the apps are a total mess and will lock up the set and only a restart will cure it.<br /><br />At any rate, I'm reasonably happy with it as a TV, but I really shouldn't have needed to work that hard to get it to that point."

It is all name-brand parts in side and while every part isnt the best out there, they are all more than sufficient.  The stock intel CPU fan was disappointing but can be replaced.  The giant side fan made of plastic makes more noise than I would like, but I like that case cools as much as it does abd if you really want to you can unplug the side fan.  The mouse and keyboard are on the cheap side (useless to me since I have better).  8 gigs is fine but I certainly upgrade to 16.  But the core hardware is great and the speed of it is perfect.

It seems the Promote isn't intelligent enough to actually work with the camera and read its light meter/exposure.<br /><br />What this means is before every (or almost every) shot you would need to check the camera's light meter to see what your shutter speed should be for an exposure of 0 (or -1, or whatever you wanted the center of the bracketing to be). Then you need to set that in the Promote. From there it will shoot at whatever EV separation you want.<br /><br />It's an inefficient process and unfortunate that they didn't think it through. Perhaps it is too much to ask for one remote to work with every type of camera on the market so they had to come up with a ""good enough"" solution that just is not good enough for us.<br /><br />This is only compounded by their lack of phone support for the product.

AFG34IQ4SFYYAK32NRF7SWDEFJMA,B012M8LXQW,5,144,False,"I purchased this in Japan during my visit during release and decided to put up a review due to seeing none on here.  I also picked up a i5-6600k for my brother which I've already reviewed.<br /><br />The i7-6700k is intels' quad core update to the devil canyon's i7-4790k and clocks at 4 ghz stock and turbo speeds go to 4.2ghz. It's easily one of the better overclocking chips out as it's thermal structure has been improved.  It's performance is from my benchmarks are around 6%-12% faster than my i7-4790k, which makes it worth the price difference.<br /><br />Price: The MSRP on the i7-6700k is $350 which is inline with previous comparable cpu's, but looking at the whole picture with the skylake (z170) chipset you have to buy a new motherboard that supports it of which most are easily $100 over z97 motherboards as well as expensive ddr4 memory. Of all the motherboards out for the skylake platform (z170) most currently do not support the cheaper ddr3 or ddr3L.<br />So overall the cpu costs may be similar but you should expect a $200 or so cost premium over the devil's canyon z97 build (even more as deals for the older chipset come out).  I'm more than willing to pay that for the other new features that are included with skylake which i'll get into below.<br /><br />What's new:<br />With the skylake platform comes some features which are now included standard with most z170 motherboards. The first is USB 3.1 which will double USB speeds to 10gbps. The second being DMI 3.0, which allows 4 x PCIE  3.0 lanes as well as up to 20 pci express lanes. M.2 SSD's while not a skylake exclusive will now be compatible with the 4x PCIE 3.0 lanes meaning you'll be able to achieve SSD speeds of up to 8gb's (The SM951 is at 2gbps at the moment). The third significant change being DDR4 which is the next memory speed upgrade iteration.<br /><br />Performance:<br />Although I upgraded to skylake more for the other new features, the CPU was definitely a factor as I encode quite a bit of video as well. I noticed a 8% increase in my video encoding speeds on the x264 encoding platform compared to the i7-4790k. When it came to gaming I didn't really notice much of an improvement as my system since the i7-4790k and 6700k both did a very good job at it. Photoshop definitely was faster at rendering files, and combined with my new M.2 sm951 hard drive loaded up much faster as well.  I was able to overclock this baby to 4.6ghz with 100% stability with relative ease. That further increases speeds another 10%.<br />Performance wise I overall say a 6-12% increase of speeds (before overclock). Not too good, but enough to keep me happy.<br /><br />Heat/Power Usage: I noticed the overall heat in my case which is air cooled did not rise above 30 degrees at idle and did not rise about 55 degrees on load. Which was much better over my 4790k which had temps of around 5 degrees higher during load. This is with the noctua u9s heatsink. Power usage was 110 watts which is the same as the 4790k. I'd also suggest if you want to put on your own thermal paste, put it in a line patter from down to up with a triangle on the bottom left. I was told the pea version isn't as effective on skylake.<br /><br />Conclusion: Overall I'd highly recommend purchasing a i7-6700k over the now outdated i7-4790k due to the speed increases, new skylake features, as well as better thermal structuring. I wouldn't upgrade from the 4790k to the 6700k but if I was building a new rig from scratch I'd definitely go for it over the 4970k. Compared to the i5-6600k in stock it's also much faster. Note: If you're on a tighter budget I'd suggest either using devil's canyon or if you still want skylake go for the i5-6600k, you can overclock that to 4.2ghz and save yourself $100. If you're not that advanced of a user or want the latest and best I'd still recommend the i7-6700k over it. Also if you're divided between the z99 series and skylake and need more cores (8-12) go with the x99 series. It's not a comparable platform.<br /><br />My current build for referance: https://pcpartpicker.com/builds/edit/?userbuild=Z3TH99"

Overclocks flawlessly to 4.6GHz with ASUS Suite 3. I have no doubt I can push it to 5Ghz but that's for later OC sessions planned in the future.<br /><br />Dx12 support is upcoming and it should be awesome.<br /><br />I have experienced about 15-30 FPS gains using the same SLI GPUs from my i5-4670k build.<br /><br />Cooling:<br />Fully compatible with my Corsair H110i GTS Liquid Cooler, which I use to keep it very cool. (under 45 C under load) Air cooling was so so at 70 C<br /><br />Cons: No heat sink included, but this is a non-issue for overclockers like myself who go the liquid cooling route. Intel seems to be cheaping out on these things to increase their profits.<br /><br />Unfortunately with the new chipset it requires new motherboard and new ram, which means more of an initial investment. Still decided to go through with it as it was worth the other improvements that came with the chipset such as more pcie lanes, which means fast M.2 ssd's and more lanes to my SLI setup.<br /><br />Price-point is marginally higher than previous architecture releases, but understandably so. (By Approx $30 or so)<br /><br />Marginal Improvements at best over devil canyon.<br /><br />Other Thoughts: This build was well worth the wait. The performance increases, multi-tasking (especially coupled with the new Windows 10 operating system), and video encoding/rendering are noticeably improved from my i5-4670k build.<br /><br />If you are deciding whether to go with a i7-4790k that you get on sale for $250 vs this, I'd still say to go for the I5-6600k as the performance compares benchmark wise more or less inline to each other. I wouldn't recommend getting the i7-6700k for an extra $100-130 as it's availability is nonexistant till september/october, and the performance gains are minimal at best for the extra cost. This chip is the best bang for the buck as far as current skylake releases go."

Tossed it and had to buy another wireless mouse. The other flaw is that this does not come with a Fast Gig Ethernet port.

Everything was explained thoroughly in words and pictures, assuming that I know nothing, a safe assumption.<br /><br />I had to set this monitor farther away from me than I had my previous 22"" monitor because at the resolution my motherboard based graphic's maximum resolution of 1920 x 1080 I could see individual pixels, none of which were dead.. I sharpened the picture using the monitor's controls but I'm going to upgrade my graphics to a card that will provide a resolution of 2560 x 1600 for a mere $60. dollars from Amazon. I believe that will solve the problem of seeing little rectangular pixels.<br /><br />I'm using the integrated Intel HD 4600 graphics on my motherboard. It  is at the highest resolution.

AGWPYUXR43CM7C5CYUE4SUEC62QA,B004NF0LGG,5,3,False,"This is a great ultra-ultrabook. The screen is bright and sharp with great contrast and rich color. The hardware is ample to push flash video, Netflix, etc., perfectly smoothly. It's not a gaming rig; but everything you need to do on the go or around the house can be run smoothly. It's so thin and light it's really a pleasure to pick up and hold. It feels solid, cool. The keyboard's backlight works great, but more importantly, the key travel is pretty nice compared to other ultrabooks (S3, Zenbook) or even some full notebooks with an island keyboard. In other words, it's a fabulously portable, so thin and light you can fit it in just about any bag, and it's still really quite comfortable to type on.<br /><br />I do not notice the network card has any particularly weak signal.<br /><br />The thing is however a complete fingerprint magnet. Unless you wear clean cotton gloves every time you handle it, it's going to be all smudges inside and out after a day. The screen is 1366x768; this isn't spectacular, there are screens with higher pixel density. However, it's enough real estate to see any document or website and yet be comfortable to read.<br /><br />It's not a powerhouse but it is a fine machine. If you want ultra portability and plenty of power for productivity, it's hard to find a cooler package that delivers the goods!<br /><br />Hurry and get yours today, before Apple convinces a jury that anything that's rectangular, folds in half, has keys on the bottom half and a screen on the top half, is too similar to a Macbook! Patented shape! Keys with letters of the alphabets were Apple! Intel chip architecture is Apple! Apple invented bits and bytes!"
AGWPYUXR43CM7C5CYUE4SUEC62QA,B0051OLOUA,5,1,False,"I have to admit I saw this at Costco and bought it online primarily for the aesthetic qualities. I purchased it about a year and a half ago but only recently started to use it frequently. Finally - far too late given that this particular model is a little outdated - I can write a review.<br /><br />The keyboard is comfortable. It's an island keyboard with fairly squared off chicklet keys, and no backlight. The keyboard is high-contrast and easy to read, even just by the light cast from the screen in relatively low light. It's a nice soft-touch keyboard but I have to admit it takes some getting used to. They key travel is not as restricted as some netbooks, but no better than others. What this means is that if you're accustomed to the key punch travel from an 'old style' 100% laptop keyboard or a full-size desktop keyboard, this will seem a little awkward. Sometimes I miss a few keys, have to hit M and left shift a little harder than I expect to for the key press to register.<br /><br />The screen is bright, crisp and colorful. It's not leap-out-at-you bright and super-saturated colorful like a Samsung or Apple display but this, as with most HPs, is really very bright and crisp anyway. Contrast on the screen is medium; I may see if the Intel HD 3000 software has any ability to increase contrast a smidgen. The viewing angle is good, colors are intact and image is clear up to around 35-40 degrees and starts to wash out around 45 degrees. It's not 180-degree viewing.<br /><br />I upgraded this one to 6GB RAM, but don't really do anything too intensive. RAM is so cheap, though, that I always tend to 'overkill-upgrade' all my new laptops. If you're spending $500 to $1000 on a laptop, and overkill-RAM is only another $20 to $60... why not? The performance is very snappy on this thing, even old Core i3 is plenty of horsepower to push around PDFs, Word Docs, graphics editing, videos. I haven't attempted any gaming on it yet, but any laptop without a discrete GPU is going to be so-so. In every case, it'll run older 3D games in low res and newer RTS or RPG games in low res but that's just about it. This isn't designed for gaming.<br /><br />In everyday desktop computing, the thing stays perfectly cool, just about the best I've seen for any laptop. After an entire day of browsing, documents, charging the phone, plugging in the USB thumb drive, etc., the bottom is still BARELY warm. Again, I haven't tried any games, but this thing isn't going to really cook unless you try to watch a movie or play a FPS game on it.<br /><br />It has the standard DVD-RW combo drive, and maybe the only less-than-solid part of this notebook is that the cosmetic shell of the DVD drive - the silver outside edge of the DVD door - is a LITTLE loose. There are three USB (I believe USB 2.0) ports, one full-size HDMI, Ethernet, VGA, headphone, mic, and SD card slot - a standard, complete compliment of ports. It also has a fingerprint scanner, which I've actually found to work really well. I generally only use it to unlock the notebook but to date, I have never once needed to re-scan a fingerprint. It has worked 100% accurately scanning my index finger over several hundred tries. This is a neat feature in that it encourages you to be a little more secure about your personal information without much inconvenience. Most of the time I do not put a password on personal computers, only work computers.<br /><br />I have not exercised the battery life. For my purposes I rarely use it for more than a meeting or an hour here or there off the wire.<br /><br />Finally, the aesthetic. The brushed aluminum shell is very attractive. Feels cool to the touch and very solid. The specs say 1.27"" thick but it feels very light and slender at that. It feels nice when you carry it, it fits in my attache. The lid and the keyboard surface have the aluminum surface. On the keyboard surface, there's a thin strip of polished metal around the edges of the keyboard tray and mouse, which is a nice touch. The bezel around the screen is gloss black plastic and the bottom is textured black plastic. The keyboard tray is also black plastic. That's slightly regrettable; although you don't spend a whole lot of time looking at the bottom of your laptop (or, YOU may, but I don't) it's still nice to see when you're folding it up and putting it away, and nice to feel the same smooth, solid material when you hold it. This isn't a new lesson for HP. The brushed aluminum ProBooks from this same generation had a brushed aluminum bottom case as well. Of course it's a cost cutting decision and this isn't a high-end laptop, so it's well within expectation. If you care enough to have metal on the bottom of your laptop and in between the keys, there are plenty of options available. Sony, Apple, Asus, HP, etc. etc.<br /><br />When I rate any consumer product I always consider ""value"" to be the final deciding factor. No product is completely, 100% perfect, with every possible feature and convenience. It's always a weighted evaluation of what you get for what you paid. As mentioned, this notebook has some very nice features and a nice form factor, and I believe I got it at a pretty good price, less than Costco or Amazon's current price. Even with a RAM upgrade it's a great deal. Although the 2050us model may be a bit dated by now, I would highly recommend a current dm4 model if you're looking for an attractive, portable, reasonably powerful full laptop with a full-size keyboard and optical drive for day to day browsing, documents, graphics, videos and movies."
AECQLNKOA57BTDBYN6O73HJ2XF6A,B001NJ0D0Y,5,1,True,"Excellent quiet cooler. I installed this in 7 min. Just read instructions and your good to go. When I first opened the box, I was really surprised as how big this thing was. I was nervous so I didn't think it would fit. Once installed, it worked wonderfully, I recently bought an AMD Athlon 64x2 Dual Core 4600+for a 5 year old store bought eMachine PC. I thought my stock CoolerMaster cooler would handle it, but it couldn't. My temps went up to 46 degrees(being average) to 55, sometimes spiking up to 59/60 degrees. Since running that hot, computer dramatically ran very slow. After researching throughout Amazon, I found this cooler, that supported those High-end Intel and AMD AM2/AM3 processors like i5/i7 and Phenom quad and the 6 core. Without thinking twice I immediately ordered it. Looks amazing when your holding it in your hands. First time experience with aftermarket (not really an aftermarket since its the same manufacturer as my stock cooler, but upgraded) cooler. No regrets, I will upgrade the stock Motherboard, Ram, and Athlon CPU to something more powerful, and maybe add another nvidia 550 ti G-Card, so I'm hoping that this cooler will stand up to the AMD Phenom FX 6 Core Black-Edition CPU. Just trying to ""patiently"" get ready for Rockstar GTA 5."
AELT3Q4CYQCL3OJ7NSUY7UMQRT3Q,B07G4LVZQZ,4,5,True,"I needed an inexpensive basic Windows machine quickly, and this fit the bill. I've had it for about 5 months. The SSD boots up very fast. I'm able to do some fairly minor video composition work, even. It handles basic office tasks and video streaming well. The downsides of this computer are 2 things to keep in mind if you are eyeing it. The external USB Wifi adapter supplied (N) would not connect to my Wifi 6 network, so I bought another Wifi network adapter (AC), which would normally work perfectly as AC works with Wifi 6. This new adapter also did not connect. The Wifi adapter senses the networks nearby fine, but just will not connect. I spent 4-5 hours so far trying to get it to connect. So I have accepted there will be no wireless with this computer, but thankfully I can use wired ethernet.<br />** The other VERY notable issue is this computer's Intel i5 chip will not be able to upgrade to Windows 11. Windows 10 support is only until 2025 so if this computer lasts until then its total life will be 2022-2025, 3 years. Regardless of these limits, I am actually very pleased with the value of this computer so far and would recommend it - for $179 it was an extremely good deal. But in case you plan to use it for Windows 11/ past 2025, or have a Wifi network better than average, then I would warn against it."
AGAZTDVDO6RFGAUAXV75SLHU57NQ,B00728ZBC0,4,7,True,"The [[ASIN:B00728ZBC0 Panasonic Lumix ZS20 14.1 MP High Sensitivity MOS Digital Camera with 20x  Optical Zoom (Silver)]] is an incredible little camera. It has a ton of features including full manual control and 1080p/60p video in AVCHD Progressive mode and 1080p/30p in mp4.  The pictures are very good and there isn't much need to change from the Intelligent Auto (I.A) mode for most shooting conditions. You also get the ability to store custom settings if you need to. The detail in photos and video is very good, shooting performance is very good with a very fast autofocus system. Macros are beautiful and have rich vibrant colors. The 20x zoom is very good but can be difficult to keep steady whilst shooting video (use a tripod for best results). For still shots, there's some color loss (as expected) at maximum zoom but the photos are still pretty good. The flash is very bright though, so you may not want to use it for very close shots.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very good camera in a small package.

AESSTMEMLNY6EZYHFBGRB3EXPH5A,B003LM2K3Y,4,38,False,"I took the Nex-3 to Vegas for a 4-day trip.  Took quite a few pictures and was quite impressed with it, but I will return it afterward due to the following short-comings:<br />. Failed to power on at times: this problem happened intermittently (twice during 4 days of use) and was annoying.  The firmware version was 1.0<br />. Unpredictable images: at times, a picture taken would have the object (my girlfriend) too dark. When I retook the picture, it would be brighter the 2nd time, but it's just unpredictable.  I use Intelligent Auto mode all the time.<br />. Severely distorted images on the sides: people on the left or right side look fatter.  This must be caused by the 16mm lens, and I wish I had the 18-55mm lens instead.<br />. Confusing User Interface & operations: beside the cumbersome UI menu, I one time ran into situation when the camera refused to take picture (I believe after a self-timed picture). I tried switching modes, powering off, as well as other things, but ended up taking out the battery to clear it.  Whatever that was, I wouldn't want having to do it again.<br />. One instance when night-time recording of fireworks couldn't focus: as I was recording fireworks and paused in-between scenes, the camera was completely out of focus and I was powerless to do anything beside turning it off and on.<br /><br />Other than those, I really like the look and feel of the Nex-3 (it fits my small hand better than the Nex-5).  Non-flash pictures taking in minimum lighting turned out great (the most important feature for me).  The screen is gorgeous.  And the camera feels quite compact with the 16mm lens.<br /><br />Other side notes: a mini-HDMI cable/adapter is not included, so you'll need to buy one in order to hook the camera to an HDMI monitor.  The strap included with the camera has a super-cheap feel, so you'll probably want to buy one as a favor for your neck.  And while you're at it, buy a capkeeper cuz the lens cap is much smaller then the barrel and is real hard to put on and can drop easily if you didn't put it on right.  There's no printed manual, so you'll have to look it up in the included CD instead.<br /><br />I wanted a Point-and-shoot camera that can give me good pictures in low-light conditions (at parties, clubs, or under street lights) and decent auto-focused videos, while being easy to use.

AESSTMEMLNY6EZYHFBGRB3EXPH5A,B000QAVVAM,4,0,True,"I used this case to build a PC that would be used mainly in my home recording studio, along with processing of HD video clips.  Thus the #1 requirement is for a quiet PC with decent power.<br /><br />PROs: the case is of good size, the power supply is quiet, the cushions for mounting the internal 3.5"" drives are neat.<br />CONs: the user's guide sucks, the included chassis fan is very noise even at low setting.<br /><br />I was able to install an ASRock X58 Extreme motherboard, an Intel i7 920 CPU, and a Scythe Mugen 2 CPU fan, along with 3 DDR3 just fine in this case.  The noise of the included rear chassis fan is agonizing.  The fan has 3 settings, and even as I used the lowest setting, it was still so noisy that it made me wonder why Antec would include such a noisy fan in a ""quiet"" case.  I ended up replacing the Antec fan with a Scythe Gentle Typhoon 1150rpm and installed a second Scythe fan behind the front panel.  The volume of air moved by the original Antec fan is much higher than the Scythe fan, but I compensated for the loss with having 2 Scythe fans and ended up with a whisper-quiet PC.<br /><br />I actually got greedy and overclocked the CPU from 2.6MHz to 3.4MHz.  The CPU temperature would jump from a 42C-idle to 49C in moderate use, on a 80-F day.<br /><br />It would have been nicer if Antec added some sound insulation foam inside the case to make it even more quiet.  I ended up putting 2 sound-proof panels, one at 12"" behind the rear, the other next to the side of the case (on the outside) to absorb some noise and that helps even more.<br /><br />Beside that, I'm happy enough with this case."
AFCNM4VLNLB33OPGQWIAJD5WJD6A,B00313JXMO,4,13,False,"Hello everyone!  This my first product review EVER, so here goes... something!<br /><br />I'm the type of person that prefers to hold off on technology purchases, simply because something better is always just around the corner.  Well, my old laptop finally died, and I was forced to make a purchasing decision;  I chose the Toshiba A505-S6030.<br /><br />I bought my laptop from a major electronics store in the San Francisco Bay Area, rather than online.  This turned out to be a good decision, as upon opening the laptop and turning it on, I discovered a lit pixel right smack-dab in the middle of the screen.  Since the store I bought it from had a 30-day satisfaction guarantee, exchanging it was no problem, and I had the second laptop within an hour.  You can see how purchasing this online, would have made for a rather annoying buying experience.  The laptop was on-sale for $849 (no rebates required).<br /><br />The machine comes with Windows 7 Home Premium already installed, and I was pleased to see very little bloatware;  mostly proprietary Toshiba software to utilize the custom Toshiba media buttons.  Since I had a license for Windows 7 Professional through my college's MSDN academic alliance program, I did end up re-partitioning and formatting the drive for my own custom install. All the drivers and software needed for a custom install and readily available for download at Toshiba's website.  After getting the laptop loaded with software, it was time to see what it could do.<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that this machine is a great value for the cost.  The Intel i7 720qm processor is great!  4 cores clocked at 1.6 ghz with 8 processing threads make for a very quick machine.  This machine also has turbo boost technology, and can increase the speed  of each core independently, up to 2.8 ghz.  I should note, that you cannot have all 4 cores operating at 2.8 ghz, as there would be too much heat produced.  You might get 2 cores at 2.4 or 2.2 ghz. The machine also has 4 gigs of RAM, which is definitely acceptable (although I plan on upgrading to 8 gigs around the end of the year), a decent on-board video card, the Nvidia 310m, and a 500 gig hard drive for plenty of storage space. Other nice additions are the built-in web cam with microphone, 3 USB ports, wireless N networking, dual-layer DVD writer with label-flash (similar to light-scribe), fire-wire, eSATA connection, 10/100/1000 RJ45 network connection, VGA, an SD/XD/MMC memory card reader, a touch-pad with multi-touch capabilities, a modem (who even uses one anymore), and HDMI output.  Also, the harman/kardon speakers are the best I've ever heard on a laptop.  Quite impressive.<br /><br />Now, getting back to the Nvidia 310m... this laptop is NOT a gaming machine, nor did I purchase it for that reason... however, being a casual gamer, I had to try out a few games just to see how they would perform; and I was quite surprised.  While you won't find me logged on to World of Warcraft, you might see me on Runes of Magic from time to time (a free 3d MMORPG).  With most of the graphic settings on medium-high to high, it was running very smoothly!  Amazing!  Dragon Age: Origins also ran pretty smooth with graphics at medium settings.  This graphics card is listed as an entry level, 3rd class mobile video card, so perhaps the i7 was doing the brunt of the work, but nevertheless, this machine can run 3D applications fairly well.  Just remember, if you are primarily interested in a gaming laptop, this isn't the one for you.  Also, don't plan on playing any games with the touch-pad, invest in a USB mouse.<br /><br />Now, this machine has a lot of power under the hood, and its easy to see where Toshiba made some sacrifices to keep the price low.  First, Toshiba opted for a DVD writer combo drive, rather than a Blue Ray reader/DVD writer combo.  Also, while the keyboard does have a full numerical pad on the right, it also has a somewhat cheap plastic look and feel.  The LCD display is bright and colorful, and overall looks nice, but is only 1366 by 768 resolution... so if you have any applications that require a window height of 800 pixels, you're out of luck (or you'll be moving the window up and down a lot).  The battery is 6 cells instead of 9, so you will likely get 1 1/2 to 2 hours of battery life.  Lack of Bluetooth was not a deal breaker for me, but still a minor inconvenience, and the 500 gig hard drive spins as 5400 RPM instead of 7200.  Finally, while the appearance and design of the laptop is very nice, it will collect fingerprints and smudge marks quite effortlessly.<br /><br />Overall, I think the A505-S6030 is a tremendous value!  You get great processing power, good video capabilities, and overall awesome performance and portability, all for a great price.  If you've been waiting for a laptop able to do bit of everything, this might be the one for you.  I am pleased to say that I won't need a desktop machine for the next few years.  For those of you who are in the graphic design business, a nice wide-screen LCD monitor and a USB mouse would be a great companion for this laptop.<br /><br />The windows experience index rating for this laptop is as follows:<br /><br />Processor: 6.9<br />Memory: 5.9<br />Graphics: 4.7<br />Gaming Graphics: 6.0<br />Primary Hard Disk: 5.8<br /><br />Also, one final note.  If you purchase this laptop, be sure to correctly break in the battery to get the best possible life.  This would entail:<br /><br />1. Charging the battery completely with the laptop off.  The charge light will change from orange to white when charged.<br />2. Using the laptop until you drain the battery completely.<br />3. Removing the battery from the laptop for 30 minutes or more, then again charging to full while the laptop is off.<br /><br />I recommend doing this the first 3 times you use the battery, and then at least once a month to keep the battery in good condition and increase longevity.  By customizing the eco power-saving mode settings, I am getting about 2 1/2 hours per charge.  Not bad for such a powerful laptop."

I'm using the optical out from my computer and the coax-digital from my Blu-Ray player to the AH01 and the sound that this combination puts out is really good, a great bargain. My idea of what sounds good is based on my living room system for serious listening sessions: it is composed of 3 different sets of speakers (KEF 103.3 Reference w/ cube, Rauna TYR, Magnepan 1.7), SAE X10-A amp or Harmon Kardon Citation XX amp, Schiit Modi DAC (optical), using only WAV or FLAC files from custom build Intel Xeon workstation, so this &#34;cheap&#34; system on my lanai with the Teac AH01 / Fluance SX6 / 8&#34; sub is an outstanding value.  I also tried using my Dayton Audio B652s and Micca MB42-X speakers with the Teac AH01 and they sounded so much better that I ever heard them connected to either of my other amps or Sony ES HT receivers.  The only part of the AH01 that I feel is lacking is the headphone side, none of my headphones sound as good as the speakers.  The Schiit Modi/Magni combination that I have sounds much better with the headphones that I have (Senn HD-598, ATH-M50, MDR 7506, HIFIman HE-400, Philips Fidelio X1, Stax SRD-34, Senn HD-455).  The sound from my Asus Xonar soundcard seems to works better with some of my headphones, even the built in Realtek 889 chip on my mobo sounds better with some of the headphones.  Maybe I was expecting too much of the Teac AH01 on the headphone side as they make a few really high-end headphone amps / DACs.  I also tried using my phone's headphone output as a source and connected it to the RCA input on the AH01 and the sound with SX6 / sub combination was great.  The SX6 can do without the sub but the Micca's need the sub."

Unless you're pretty tech savvy I recommend that option!<br /><br />Overall we've been pretty happy with this stereo.  We bought it for my mom's car and largely for the large screen, backup camera, and aux input.  All of the above work well; no complaints.  Don't get me wrong; if you're an audiophile this is not the stereo for you.  But frankly if you're an audiophile it's pretty unlikely you're reading this.  For the price this has decent sound and some nice features.<br /><br />My primary caveat is that the user interface isn't super self explanatory.

AEIID43Y5VNCZCTG5VPY64SUTMUA,B00KOUIZBC,5,2,True,"I've been through quite a few laptops in the last few years and realized I'm done with Microsoft.  I used Linux in the past, but with previously being in school that required Windows based programs, I felt chained to the evil corporation and it's tentacles.  Now that I can be free and use what I want to use, a Chromebook was my obvious choice.<br /><br />I did TONS of research before choosing this specific model from Acer.  I was originally looking at Toshiba's offerings, but this model has something that most Chrombooks don't... an amazing processor for little money.  While Celeron processors are probably fine if you use the Chromebook for nothing more than e-mail and light internet browsing, it won't do if you're a power user running multiple apps and streaming at the same time.  This model boasts an Intel Core i3 processor, which is extremely fast and multi-tasks like a dream.  I'm known for having half a dozen tabs open at once with heavy streaming use, and the processor is still faster than any other laptop I've owned.<br /><br />If you're a visual junkie, this screen is not for you.  The screen could be categorized as &#34;acceptable&#34;, and it no where compares to any other basic laptop I've owned.  I don't like matte screens that much, but put up with it for the other amazing capabilities of the laptop itself.  The screen gets the job done, but you're definitely missing out on the detail other screens may offer.  If you're not doing visually heavy apps or games, then you may not notice a big difference.<br /><br />The keyboard isn't amazing, as it feels like one of those add on keyboards that goes to my tablet.  While the keys are sensitive enough, I find myself making spelling errors much more often because of how the keys are spaced.  The keys are a bit smaller than the average laptop and you're missing some old favorite keys such as &#34;end&#34;, &#34;home&#34; and &#34;delete&#34;.  It's definitely not &#34;make or break&#34; for the laptop, just something to think about if things like that get under your skin.<br /><br />The touchpad is good, but I do wish it had actual buttons to click and not just a touchpad itself.  It is rather responsive, but I find myself resting a finger on it as a scroll, forgetting there are no buttons to click to select something.  That's probably just me, and if you're used to a Mac laptop, you'll have no problem adjusting.<br /><br />In summary, I'm really happy with this little laptop and I'm glad I spent the money on this version and ignored the many reviews out there that were touting much slower processors as their #1 pick.  This has all the functionality of nearly every other Chromebook out there, but with the speed to not rip your hair out."

AFGDOWXYBXW46W56NEVSOPWFKLWA,B00005JMAF,3,2,False,"I'm not a huge Harry Potter fan.<br />This is not to say that I don't appreciate Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling has brought fantasy to adults and children everywhere, and I'm extremely grateful for it. However, a lot of what she wrote is familiar to fans of fantasy - indeed, in some ways she's slyly retelling the Arthurian myth (oops, did I give that away?).<br />As a result, I haven't read the books. So my critique of the movie is based on solely the movie standing on its own. This is important - the two women that I went to see it with missed flaws that confused me because they knew the backstory. If you're a raving Harry Potter fan, move on, there's nothing to see here. If you're an average Joe who may not be intimately familiar with the Harry Potter series, then we can commiserate.<br />The movie starts with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) finally doing what we've always wanted him to do - teach those muggle bullies a lesson. Indeed, much of this movie has wand waving and pointing in a manner that suggest harm if not death. Right away, we understand that Harry is mad and he's not going to take it anymore.<br />Harry runs away from home, only to get picked up by a bus for homeless wizards. This wacky bus phases in and out of traffic, whips around hairpin turns, and is cheerfully narrated by a Jamaican shrunken head, all the while providing comfortable sleeping arrangements for down-on-their-luck wizards. From there it's off to the Leaky Cauldron. Fortunately, Harry doesn't get in trouble for ""blowing up his aunt"" - indeed, he is curiously free of all penalties or retribution for his unseemly magical behavior. Without repercussions or real consequences for his actions, Harry is united with his old friends Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Gint) and sent off to school, Monster Manual (that's an inside joke for you role-players) and all.<br />It's there that Harry discovers none other than Sirius Black, a wizard who escaped from Azkaban, hunts him. The Dementors, a Ringwraith-like series of black shrouded floating ghosts who suck the life out of the living, in turn hunt Sirius. But who is Sirius really hunting and why?<br />Because the Dementors are the long arm of the law, so to speak, they are tolerated at the school, but the headmaster (Michael Gambon, filling big shoes left by Richard Harris) warns that no one should ""give the Dementors a reason"" to harm a student.<br />That introduction pretty much sums up the problem with the movie. The Prisoner of Azkaban wants to be grown up. The Dementors genuinely threaten Harry, and he deals with very real feelings of rage and frustration. He picks fights with bullies, struggles with classes, and kids whisper behind his back. But there are consequences for such actions and the movie often fails to take them into account.<br />For example, Hermione is granted some exceedingly powerful magic that enables her to take two classes at the same time (!) and yet Harry isn't allowed on a school trip because he can't get a signed permission form from his stepparents. Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), now an instructor for the exotic beasts class, exposes his students to a dangerous hippogriff and, duh, somebody gets hurt. Harry gets in trouble for using a magical map that shows the location of everyone in the school, but it's apparently okay for the kids to play quidditch in the middle of a lightning storm. You know, the game where they fly on broomsticks chasing flying METAL BALLS. Should we be surprised that someone gets hit by lightning? In comparison, Harry's encounter with Dementors seems tame.<br />There are also some strange plot choices, such as having not one but two beings that transform into canines. Are viewers sophisticated enough to know the difference between a Grimm - a gigantic black moor hound - and a werewolf? Most unforgivable is the Massive Deus Ex Machina that is poorly explained and abruptly introduced, but manages to conveniently wraps up every loose end.<br />That said, Prisoner of Azkaban is a beautifully visualized movie, a sort of Gormenghast version of the earlier cheery installments. Alfonso Cuaron films everything through a dark lens, but with a humorous aside. Yes, this is a darker, scarier movie, but it's all in fun.<br />The actors are a mixed bag. Radcliffe doesn't display a lot of range in a role that demands much - weeping is not his forte. Gint isn't much better. His character is still a caricature, a bumbling scaredy cat that seems a little too attached to his pet rat Scabbers. The nature of the pets are never truly explained - are they familiars and thus important to magic or merely pets? If they're just pets, why would the school tolerate them? If they're familiars, Ron should be in big trouble for repeatedly losing Scabbers.<br />David Thewlis is superb as Professor Lupin, alternately playing a sad and extremely intelligent professor who once knew Harry's parents. Equally engaging is Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). Throw in Gary Oldman as Sirius Black and you've got three excellent actors at the top of their game. Unfortunately, the new Dumbledore simply does not have the weary, measured wisdom that Harris brought to the role. Dumbledore feels like a younger guy in a wig and moustache.<br />The true star of this movie is Watson. Like Harry, she experiences all stages of teen drama, from fright to frustration to just plain fist-fightin' mad and displays all of them with the prowess of a professional actress. Watson gets my vote for the one most likely to ""survive"" (in the way the Star Wars cast survived) this series when it ends.<br />Ultimately, those who love the book will love this movie. But as an outsider looking in, it seemed like a lot was left out. My wife was able to fill in the blanks, but she shouldn't have to."

AFP3XJSQU3FGGBB2F5JFNZPJ7MHQ,B0009ZCTX2,5,13,False,"This review was written based on the following configuration:<br />- HP desktop with an Intel Pentium D930 with Win XP Pro and 1GB memory<br />- Using the DVI cable (supplied by Viewsonic) from an EVGA FX5500 AGP 256MB video card.<br />- Running at the best resolution prescribed by the monitor (1280 x 1024).<br />- No monitor or text-enhancing software has been applied.<br /><br />In my opinion, all LCDs should be run using the DVI cable and a good quality video card (about $50 and up.)  The VGA cable will run the LCD, but the text MAY be less sharp.  Installing/upgrading your video card is as easy as installing your new monitor, and will make your video experience that much better.<br /><br />The monitor is mounted on the wall about 2-feet (.6 m) from me, and I have never had a problem viewing the text on the web or in MSWord while in it's native 1280 x 1024 resolution.  (TIP: while using Mozilla's Firefox you can hit CTRL++ to make the web text larger, and CTRL+- to make it smaller.  It's quicker and easier than changing the screen resolution each time.)<br /><br />Games work well on the monitor, but then again, the games I use are pretty outdated when compared to other reviewers.  If you are a desktop publisher or avid Internet browser you will find that a good video card can help you obtain the correct color and make fine adjustments on your monitor.  Don't get me wrong: the monitor straight out of the box has a beautiful picture, but if you are as fussy about color as I am you will probably find yourself adjusting the color.  I found it could use a bit more vibrance and contrast.  Remember: this monitor is made to be paired with a good video card that can perform the color correction and provide the proper resoltuion.  The monitor itself ONLY provides buttons for brightness and contrast.<br /><br />The printed ""Quick Start Guide"" is only 3 pages long.  Though it is easy to follow and only takes 4 steps it has you rely on the ""User Guide"" that is installed on the disc that comes with the monitor.  This is only a small annoyance to me since I prefer the printed text over flipping through an electronic book.  Oh, and the Quick Start Guide comes in 17 languages!  I think Sanskrit is the only language left out.<br /><br />My monitor arrived with NO DEAD PIXES.  Though dead pixes have become an inherent gamble with LCDs I do not feel that Viewsonic's products are any more or less susceptible to the dead pixel nightmare.  I have to admit, I was quite nervous about receiving one with dead pixels, but am now very pleased with my many months of shopping around for the monitor with the least amount of complaints.<br /><br />The speakers, however, are useless for anything other than the dings and dongs of Windows.  Music/movies shouldn't even be attempted on these 1-inch 1 watt speakers.<br /><br />I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this monitor for it's size, color, crispness of text, ability to be wall-mountable and price."

AEA4ZEZN3PJGYSPUQZ3UMDZ6QDEA,B002DPUUK0,3,0,False,"This is a nicely-designed mouse with a cool little transceiver that plugs flush into the back of it.  I bought it because of the style and the bluetrack technology.<br /><br />I used to use a Microsoft Laser wireless mouse that I absolutely loved for its pinpoint accuracy, but the problem was that it didn't work  on certain surfaces.  For example, on wood grain it would jump around a lot.  On any reflective surface, like my desk that has a white polished surface, it wouldn't work at all.  I was hoping bluetrack, which says it works on ""any surface"" would fix this.<br /><br />It doesn't.  I'm disappointed to say that it still really doesn't work at all on a reflective surface.<br /><br />Now looking closer at the bluetrack advertising here, I see that it really means that it works well on uneven surfaces, not flat surfaces  with patterns on it.  This seems silly - how often does one need to mouse on a rough surface like a carpet or couch or something?<br /><br />Also, I find that it's much less accurate than my old Laser mouse.  I just don't have that confidence that I can just move and point to any spot on the screen - sometimes it just misses where I'm trying to go, which makes it a less than pleasant mousing experience.<br /><br />Microsoft wants you to install its Intellipoint software (included) before using the mouse.  I did this, although I later plugged it into another computer and it worked the same, so I think this is unnecessary.  I also noticed that once installed, Intellipoint runs ipoint.exe in the background all the time at startup (I'm still on Win XP).  I hate unnecessary software that just has to run at startup all the time for no reason.  The Intellipoint does nothing for the accuracy or functioning of the mouse, and I'd recommend not installing it.<br /><br />The mouse is ok but I'd buy a Laser if I was doing it again.  Actually, I'd buy an old mouse with a ball in it if I could find a wireless one.  At least those would REALLY work on any surface!  No one wants to make anything with moving parts anymore though, which is sad."
AEP5ECSVNE6M72FJQGRINREJMKXQ,B009B0MZ1M,5,53,False,"This camera was worth waiting for.<br /><br />My review might be too long for some persons.  In that case you may scroll through to the Pros and Cons at the end.<br /><br />First for some background on me for context.  I am an amateur but aspiring to be advanced photographer having been only a snap-happy point and shoot user over the years.  3 years ago I bought the Canon SX120 with the 10x optical zoom specifically for a function at which I was gonna be sitting some distance away from the action.  I was very impressed with the zoom and the photo quality, especially considering this was an indoor function and the lighting was not great.<br />Ever since then I have been hooked on Canon and have been anticipating each generation of new high-end P&S cameras.  I first fell for the SX30, then the SX40 and finally when the SX50 was announced I knew I HAD to have it.  After researching all alternatives online for months I finally took the plunge and haven't regretted it since.<br />I got the camera just before Christmas 2012 and was tempted to write my first impressions at that time but thought better of it.  So after nearly 4 months and over 3000 photos and videos here goes:<br /><br />Build and layout<br />This is a $400 camera but feels like much more.  It has an all-plastic body but there is nothing flimsy about it at all.  Everything feels very solid in my hand.  Those accustomed to using full-size DSLRs will notice it is somewhat lighter and smaller but the overall form factor is identical and allows users to ""play photographer"" just like the big boys (especially if you slapped on an EOS neck-strap like I did, haha).<br />The hand grip is deep enough to allow for a good solid one-handed grip on the camera (I'm 5'11"" with big hands).  With this hold though there is the likelihood of accidentally hitting the menu button or self-timer with the fleshy part of your palm at the right thumb.  It happens infrequently and I have learnt how to hold the camera to prevent that happening, most times.  Annoying, but not a deal-breaker for me.<br />Other cons on the layout: the card and battery compartment are located on the bottom of the camera and are inaccessible while using a tripod.  My guess is that most users of this camera wont find that a big issue since tripod use is almost unnecessary considering the image-stabilization (IS) on this camera. Will get to that later.<br />Personally I would prefer to see the playback and video capture buttons reverse place (as in the SX40) because I find I have to adjust my grip to hit the video button while shooting stills and that can be awkward and sometimes causes me to lose a shot.  Other than that the buttons are well laid out and within reach.<br />Menus and controls are fairly simple and intuitive, especially for previous Canon users.  New users will appreciate the brief descriptive on-screen explanations and tips on each menu option.  Sadly, a few things are inexplicably complex and inaccessible.  (See my comment about hi-speed burst shooting in Performance below).<br /><br />Zoom<br />Believe the hype.  The zoom on this camera is THAT good.  It reaches so far that you can see details that are completely invisible to the naked eye: - the tail numbers on jets passing overhead;  Who knew that your favorite player had a wrist injury?  This camera picks up his wrist-strap all the way from the bleachers;  You can read the watch on the preacher's hand and signal him to stop already!  Pictures of the moon are detailed and sharp - the craters are clearly visible.  This camera is binoculars, telescope and spy-scope all in one!<br />Admittedly picture quality suffers somewhat at distance but not as much as one might expect.  Truthfully, the issues you see with the camera at full zoom are minimal and frankly 50x pics are simply not available with other lesser tools so a little loss of sharpness is acceptable considering.  I am quite proud of my moon shots and the varied color and detailed plumage of the birds in my neighbor's tree are now clearly visible.  I have great close-up shots of John Legend at his piano from mid-crowd about 100 feet away!<br />Digital zoom is helpful, but image quality degrades rapidly.  It is the nature of digital zoom and not an issue unique to Canon.<br />Canon had the good sense to realize that zooming at those distances frequently means we lose sight of our subject and have included a ""Zoom framing assist"" feature which helps you to toggle quickly between focal lengths to re-acquire your subject.  Brilliant!<br /><br />Accessories<br />Canon supplies this camera in a bare-bones package.  You will need to get a memory card (SD, micro-SD with adapter, SDHC, - class 10 recommended.  Also, there is no printed manual - it comes on a CD.<br />I also recommend a spare battery, especially for a full day of shooting and night-time events.  I get approximately 250 shots per charge.<br />I have chosen to attach a UV filter to my camera as this reduces the  haze in some scenes.  More importantly though, the filter serves as a protection for my lens (which, being non-interchangeable would kill your camera if it got damaged).<br />With the filter attached the lens cap no longer fits - which is fine for me as the filter provides the protection while allowing me to pick up my camera and start shooting right away without having to fiddle with a lens cap.<br />To fit a filter or a lens hood you are going to need a 67mm adapter.  Canon supplies the FA-DC67A which works perfectly.<br />Tripod and remote trigger (RS-60E3) are useful for those looking to do portrait or macro work.<br />The camera has a hot shoe and accepts external flashes which puts it ahead of a number of its competitors.  My own shooting style doesn't require me to use an external flash and I only rarely do.  The built-in flash is fine for me.  Its nice to know this little camera can accept external flashes though.  You may search the Canon site for compatible speedlites.  Other suppliers' equipment works too.<br /><br />Image quality (IQ)<br />In the end this is the reason we take photos.  To be honest this camera is not all-round brilliant in this area.  Which camera is?  However, It is unbeatable in good light where it approaches DSLR quality (no joke).<br />Low-light pics are not as impressive - usable, but I've seen better using other high-end P&S cameras.<br />The ""hand-held night shot"" feature is a good alternative in many situations.  It shoots a composite of 4 photos to give the best result.  This eats up memory though and introduces lengthy buffering so it slows down night-time shooting - definitely not recommended for fast-moving events such as birthday parties.  HDR helps too.<br />At full zoom in good light most pictures are very good.  Not DSLR quality (this is NOT a DSLR replacement) but truthfully most DSLR lenses would not be able to reach out that far to get those pics anyway so the SX50 still wins.<br />I shoot mostly landscapes and birds on the weekends and I find that colors are very accurately captured.  There is some fringing noticeable but only on the most contrasty shots, and only at full size/resolution.  Pictures are not DSLR sharp but not far from it.  Size 3.5"" x 5"" and 4""x6"" prints will be fine.  Pictures for posting on your social network page will be quite fine - brilliant even!<br />This camera shines in: macro, landscape, architecture/still-life, moon-shots/astronomy (a category that competitors cannot even enter).  People shots are pleasing and more than satisfactory but not best-in-class.  For professional-looking portraits get a DSLR.<br /><br />Video<br />Canon packed a lot of goodies into its video capabilities and there is much to be impressed with here.  The Full-HD video is incomparable.  `Nuff said.  Moving up from the 720p of the SX120 the difference was clearly noticeable to me.<br />Luckily Canon supplies an HDMI cable with this camera so you can view your amazing videos on your flat-screen TV.<br />Super-slow motion is useful to have a closer look at your golf swing or capture your kids at sports day.<br />Stills can be snapped while your video is running but this creates a split second break in filming and captures the shutter sound in your video.  No biggie.  Of course, you can always use photo-grab to get a photo from your videos.<br />Stereo sound is captured via built-in dual microphones but there is no jack for an external mic.  You cannot get it all in a $400 camera!<br />Zooming is available during video and zooming is quiet and precise.  The auto-focus is reasonably good but tricky scenes and rapid movement can leave your subjects out of focus for a while as the camera struggles to keep up.  There is a 30-minute limit on videos.  Keep it short.<br />Don't expect to be Steven Spielberg with this camera but your vacation videos will be quite nice.<br /><br />Image stabilsation (IS)<br />This is another area where the camera absolutely shines!  Most users will never need a tripod to get great shots out of this camera.  Hand-held shots are quite still even at full zoom.  This is especially true for users whose grip is strong and stable and whose subjects don't move much (like the buildings, plants and trees I photograph, haha).  Seriously though, Canon's lens-based IS system shines on all its P&S cameras.  In the SX50 they really outdid themselves.<br />Videos are quite steady even while the user is moving/walking/riding/driving.  Brilliant!<br /><br />Electronic viewfinder (EVF)<br />This is my biggest disappointment with this camera.  Canon should not even be allowed to call this a viewfinder.  It is crappy!<br />It can only be used to get a general sense of where your subject is in the frame - little detail is available.  Canon must at least quadruple the resolution on the next generation or forget about viewfinders.  In fairness, all screen overlay information is available in the viewfinder - but that's just me searching for an up-side.<br /><br />Screen<br />This will be your savior from the horrible viewfinder just described.  Still, although Canon improved the resolution over 2 generations they are still behind the competition here.  It is usable, but not brilliant.  The best thing about it is the fact that it swivels.  Also, at 2.8"" it is slightly smaller than its competitors.<br />There are four viewfinder/screen display options: overlay on and off, screen and viewfinder.  Hitting the ""Disp."" button cycles you through that 4-step sequence. Tedious.  Other manufacturers use a toggle that implements a lot nicer and easier.  Some more work here Canon!<br /><br />Performance<br />The camera shoots at an impressive speed with a frame rate of up to 13 frames per second (fps) in hi-speed burst mode.  This means you can shoot 10 images of Junior blasting out of the blocks at his school track meet before they've gone 3 steps.  13fps is class-leading speed and users who shoot fast action will appreciate this feature.<br />I found it a bit difficult to locate it in the menu though and even tougher to toggle between this and regular shooting modes for those in-between shots that don't require 10-frame bursts.  (In fairness, with practice one can develop the shutter control to shoot single frames even in hi-speed burst mode).<br />With hi-speed burst shooting buffering will be an issue so users have to be careful of when to fire off their 10 frames because the camera will be unusable for another 3-5 seconds.  Even so, these frame rates are not numbers that most competitors can match, indeed the frame rate on most DSLRs are less than half of what the SX50 can do.<br />Start up time is fast even if battery isn't fully charged.  Battery life trails this class of cameras at 315 frames per charge.  Still, 300+ pics per day is a lot of shooting for most casual users.<br /><br />Frills<br />My shooting requirements don't involve me using a number of the features this camera has.  I call them frills - they may be more useful to other users, though.<br />These include:<br />* HDR - high dynamic range.  This feature exaggerates the dynamic range (differences in light and color intensity) in different parts of your image.  This has the effect of making photos more dramatic, but in some subjects produces overly-stylized and even grotesque results.  HDR works better on DSLRs that capture the subtle nuances in light more intelligently and gives more authentic results.  IMO<br />* Fish-eye Effect, Miniature Effect, Toy Camera Effect, Soft Focus, Monochrome, Super Vivid, Poster Effect, Color accent and Color swap are all novelty effects that some shooters will use to bring variety to their images.  For me they are only ""nice to have"" since I rarely need them and can achieve most of them in post-production, if ever required.<br />* Self-timer, blink detector and smile detector also fall into the nice-to-have category for me.<br />There are many more - this camera is packed with extras.<br />The ""frills"" that are not present but other users may miss include: GPS, wireless control and wi-fi.<br /><br />CHDK<br />The Canon Hack Development Kit (CHDK) is open-source software that is available for most Canon Powershot cameras.  It is free and allows owners to make non-permanent, non-destructive software changes to their cameras.  These changes can turn your camera into a super device by removing most of the factory limitations.  Faster shutter speed, longer exposure times,  motion detector, intervalometer (for time lapse shooting) and bracketing are some of the new capabilities that can be added to your camera.<br />I have not used CHDK myself and thus cannot vouch for it but its nice to know that the already awesome features of my Canon P&S camera can be extended even further.<br /><br />Summary<br />This camera was worth the 3-year wait for me.  It suits my needs perfectly.  There is no denying its weaknesses (low-light IQ, viewfinder) but for me its strengths make it totally worth its price.  Advanced beginners like myself will find this a useful intermediate step before diving into the DSLR world.  It is sufficiently full-featured to challenge you and develop your photography skills while being simple enough for a child to pick up and get good shots of daddy frantically screaming ""put that down!!""<br />For its 50x zoom and image stabilization it is a worthy choice.  Most importantly, image quality is top-notch in most situations.<br /><br />Pros<br />* 50x zoom<br />* Image stabilization<br />* Image quality<br />* Shoots RAW<br />* Solid build quality<br />* Advanced ""pro"" functions<br />* Lightning speed burst mode<br />* Articulating screen<br />* Full HD video<br />* Available accessories<br />* CHDK<br /><br />Cons<br />* Unimpressive low-light performance<br />* Viewfinder resolution<br />* Sometimes confusing menu<br />* No external mic jack<br />* No GPS<br />* No wireless<br /><br />I have deliberately tried to make this review detailed enough to cover most questions that a new user will have but still easy enough to be understood by most.  And so I kept out a lot of the more technical terms that can be intimidating for beginners just looking for a decent point and shoot without having to pull out a photography glossary.  Hope it helped.  Happy snapping!!"
AFY2ABMSXE4447HXU2KUAACIJUHA,B0745H6GTX,5,7,True,"I find it utterly baffling that anyone bothers to make an eGPU enclosure that doesn't have, at a minimum, four USB 3.0 ports. Part of the idea is I can park my laptop on my desk, plug in a single cable to get peripherals, power, external display, a dedicated Ethernet connection and, in a case like this, additional graphics power. Yet so many of them lack USB, and the ones that have USB tend to lack Ethernet. It makes no sense to me to not incorporate an additional $10 of hardware into your design.<br /><br />Anyway, thankfully the Mantiz Venus MZ-02 actually DOES have just that. Heck, they even threw in a SATA port in there for extra measure in case you want to add some external storage while you're at it!<br /><br />Here is what I am running:<br /><br />-HP Spectre x360 13-ac0XX (7th-gen, Kaby Lake, Intel i7-7500U)<br />-Windows 10 x64 Home (build 18362)<br />-GIGABYTE GeForce GTX 1650 Windforce OC 4G Graphics Card (N1650WF2OC-4GD)<br /><br />The whole process was as painless and straightforward as you might suspect. No bumps, nothing super weird I had to do to get it configured. Just plug and play.<br /><br />The design of the enclosure itself is also as nice as I can expect. Simple machined aluminum, clean look, no ""extreme"" or ""gamer"" design to it, just what you see in the pictures. The tool-less side panel is nice, pops off easily enough and sits on there nice and snug, not loose or sloppy.<br /><br />So far, so good. I didn't do a ton of testing, but I did check to make sure I could open up Doom and run it at my full 2560x1080 resolution with high settings. It's a big step up from running it at 1280x720 at the lowest of the low settings because yes, it actually did run on the onboard Intel HD 620 that way with little drop in framerate. Enough I could tolerate and beat the game. Now at least I'll be able to go back and beat it again but this time appreciate the graphics a little more.<br /><br />If anything changes with this guy and it goes out I'll be updating my review.

AFDKQAKPO3W6OJILOXN6M6RAY7YQ,B004MYC6O8,4,3,True,"With the Coolermaster HAF-X being upwards of $189 you can't go wrong with the Phantom for the price of $140 or below.  I really like the fan speed controller, though I always keep the fans on high.  I have been able to overclock my I7-930 to over 3.6 GHz with an internal water-cooling kit due to the excellent air flow (4 encluded fans).  The case has excellent cable management, I am quite anal about seeing cables and this case allows a lot of space behind the motherboard to run all of your clutter.  Stock cooling on this system is good however I would recommend you pick up a 140 MM fan for the front and another 200 MM fan for the top. The front fan is a snap to install, the top one is a bit harder due to placement, but it's not impossible.  There is space for another fan on the side but if you have a very large video card it may interfere with the fan due to the fan being 200 MM.  This case will house your larger video cards nicely and has good slot management for HDDs, SSD, and anything you want to throw in it.  Also you can even turn off the fan LED which is nice for someone like me who doesn't want his system to be a nightlight.<br />System Specs:<br />ASUS X58 Motherboard<br />Intel 930 running at 3.6 Ghz<br />12 gigs of Adata 1600 DDR3 ram<br />Powercolor HD-5850<br />2 120 gb SSD<br />2 1 Tb HHD<br />DVD and Blu Ray Burner"
AE2QCH2VSPCGMS6AVFPEASA2GFJQ,B00RBG687A,5,2,True,"Fairly intuitive camera at the basic level of use, fortunately, because mine did not come with an owner's manual in English (only Spanish), and I got the camera just before leaving the country for a 41/2 week vacation.  I mostly used the &#34;intelligent&#34; function, and the pictures seem to be coming out pretty good, even with backlit situations.  Being an old 35 mm SLR user, I mostly use the viewfinder, and I have been very pleased by the image quality that it has.  Video quality seems very good, as well.  I hope to be able to learn how to take advantage of the manual options, now that we are back home.  I haven't notice any quality issues that a few other reviews have complained about.  The body is plastic, rather than metal (like our older Panasonic point and shoot had), but that seems to be the standard for the point and shoots these days."
AHUYANVC7GSROZ2SWDPRV4FSCM7Q,B009PJHD3Y,4,1,True,"We got this for my husband, this is his review.<br /><br />You won't find a better display on any laptop. Vizio's IPS 1080P LED back lit display is simply beautiful. The CPU and graphics performance are quite good, especially considering the price of the laptop. Its nicely styled and not bulky. It has only two USB 3.0 ports but that's good enough for most situations. The built in memory card reader is a must. It has no DVD ROM drive.<br /><br />Windows 8 install is very clean. There is no &#34;bonus&#34; junk software installed like most of the major brands. This is my first use of Windows 8 and I'm not impressed, I see no point in giving an OS two graphical user interfaces. One is enough for anyone.<br /><br />The hardware in the laptop is standard intel kit with HD4000 and Nvidia GT640M. The motherboard includes two DDR3 Dimm slots with two 4GB sticks installed which is up-gradable to two 8GB sticks which I'll probably do later. It has a tiny 32GB mSATA SSD which Windows 8 uses as a cache for the 1GB SATA spinning disk. It boots into Windows 8 in a matter of seconds. The mSATA SSD and hard drive are begging to be side graded to dual 256GB SSDs which would yield data throughput of a RAID 0 array of between 800 MB and 1 GB / sec for high end Samsung SSDs.<br /><br />Linux installed easily with a Kubuntu boot USB drive (I run Gentoo). To boot linux the easiest solution is to install rEFIned, an open source EFI boot manager that recognized all OSes and an EFI boot-strap-able linux kernel which will load from rEFIned. I have not found a good way to get to the intel RAID BIOS setup. Setting Boot OS to &#34;other&#34; got me there once.<br /><br />The laptop has a few drawbacks. The first laptop we received could not charge its battery. We returned it to Amazon without issue, the second laptop did not suffer from that malady. There is a review on another vendors site that talks about the same issue. Clearly this is a production problem for the device.<br /><br />The keyboard is pretty bad. When I say bad, once in a great while it fails to type when a key is pressed and slightly more often will give two characters instead of one. I generally keep this laptop docked to an external USB keyboard so it doesn't matter to me, but it may become an issue when I take it on the road.<br /><br />When pushing performance to the limits, the laptop gets uncomfortably hot, so perhaps the label &#34;laptop&#34; is a bit of a misnomer.<br /><br />Even when idle the fan spins at low RPM. This might annoy some people, it doesn't really bother me.<br /><br />I take its quirks because its display is unequaled. I'm looking forward to future designs from Vizio. If they deal with some of the problems I've listed here, I'll be a happy Vizio owner for years to come."
AEI5EMRDKBBXMO3G3GFELR5ZHK4A,B07T17918N,4,0,True,"Overall this sound bar has been enjoyable. It sometimes shuts itself off, seemingly for no reason but it could be related to an ""automatic standby"" setting that I have disabled so time will tell. The sound quality is good and this fixes my issue where the ""Smart Sound"" on my LG Smart TV makes dialogue completely unintelligible on Blu-rays and HD streaming with surround sound; I can now always hear the dialogue perfectly clear. The 3D settings isn't very desirable and just makes everything sound muddy and extra bass-heavy so I don't really understand the point. The ARC HDMI functionality works well but it doesn't turn on with my TV. My one main complaint is that it takes a long time to move the volume either up or down and there is no digital display so you have to go by the amount of LEDs lit on the unit—not very telling when each LED represents 3 different volumes."
AEI5EMRDKBBXMO3G3GFELR5ZHK4A,B00K7809O2,1,6,True,"I have never, in almost 20 years of PC tinkering, come this close to launching an entire system out a window in a fit of rage. I bought this because I previously owned a Hyper 212 and loved it but my new system uses a microATX case and this was the largest cooler I could fit in this case. The mounting pins are complete trash. One of them broke and the other still cannot fully twist into position. The stock Intel pins installed and uninstalled just fine with absolutely no problems and they look near-identical to these so why was this such a heinous experience?<br /><br />My idle temps only went down about 2°C which is pathetic (from averaging 38° to now about 36°). The only thing that improved were my load temperatures which went from 87-90°C (Scary) to 67°C (better but way below expectations).<br /><br />I bought this because the 10700 stock cooler was allowing my core temps to reach 90°C playing Borderlands 3 or using Photoshop and that concerned me. This cooler alleviates that concern but now I have a whole new worry that it might randomly pop off the motherboard because I'm not confident in the mounting pins at all. I probably will have to try and return this because it's not worth the stress. What an unimpressive, frustrating piece of trash."
AEI5EMRDKBBXMO3G3GFELR5ZHK4A,B002G1YPH0,4,2,True,"Did my temperatures go way down so I could overclock to 4.2 GHz with ease? No. Did my temperatures go down so that I could substantially overclock without worrying about my PC exploding? Certainly.<br /><br />For $30 this is a darn good cooler. The 120mm fan is sufficient but I did notice 3c-5c reduction by adding another for push/pull. Installation was difficult but it was easy enough that I accomplished it by myself and did it in under an hour.<br /><br />I don't know if the design just doesn't allow for much pressure of if I used too much paste but it's certainly not as tight as I'd like it to be.<br /><br />My temperatures went from 45-50c idle to 32-38 idle and from 72c load to about 64c load. Not ridiculous but I'm OC'ing to 3.5Ghz from 2.8 (Intel i7 930) and I live in a hot area so 64c is just fine.<br /><br />Overall I'm happy with this cooler. Be warned: It's rather tall. I'd say it's about 6-7 inches tall and BARELY fits into my Cooler Master Centurion 590 Case; I actually had to forgo a side fan because there wasn't enough room.<br /><br />If you just want a better-than-stock cooler that will get your temps down and maybe even let you Overclock a little then this will be the best $30 you ever spent. I thoroughly recommend this over the Hyper n520 as I experienced better results with this one.<br /><br />If you want to go past 3.8Ghz then I highly recommend a more powerful air cooler (Noctua, Cooler Master V6 etc.) or water cooling (Build your own, H50's leak sometimes)."
AEI5EMRDKBBXMO3G3GFELR5ZHK4A,B001NJ0D0Y,3,1,False,"I bought this for a friend who needed something better than the stock cooler on his Intel i7 870 2.93Ghz quad-core processor.<br /><br />Installing this was a complete nightmare compared to other coolers. The tiny screws needed for the Intel bracket are easily lost and the instructions were so bad that I think  they actually hindered the process; had I just tried to figure it out by myself I would have installed it twice as fast.<br /><br />What annoyed me most is that my cooler did not have a plastic protective sheath over the ""Mirror"" finished contact plate. What's even worse is that it had scratches! SCRATCHES! I should have taken it back but we needed a new cooler ASAP so I figured I'd just let the thermal paste make up the difference.<br /><br />After installing and cutting a few fingers we fired his machine up and saw that it was idling at a much nicer temperature of 29C (down from 38c.) Then we ran a stress test with LinX. At 100% load on all 4 cores the temperatures shot up to 83C stock and 93C with a slight overclock.<br /><br />I never could get his temps any lower for some reason but the temps maxed out at about 64c while doing some heavy gaming so I told him it was safe for now.<br /><br />This is pretty sad; I don't know why we had such a bad experience with this cooler because it has great reviews. It's possible that I used too much thermal paste or the contact isn't superb but even those factors wouldn't cause the load temp to shoot up past 80c. (And he has an awesome $150 case with 200mm top fans and a bunch of 120mm's as well. Great ventilation).<br /><br />My advice? If you buy one and it looks like it was returned or has been tampered with, just return it while you can. I'm sure this is a decent cooler, I think I just got a dud that someone had already messed with."

Automatic security and OS updates are guaranteed through June 2024 which is always the first thing to check when buying any Chromebook.  Google has a history of extending AUE but it's not assured.<br /><br /> Heavy as a tank.  Good key board but no back light.  Both USB type C ports are on the left side which is stupid.  Once you have experienced C ports on both sides you won't want to go back due to the ease of charging.<br /><br />Pro II is a major downgrade to the Pro and Plus ver I which are both ultra thin featherweight magnesium alloy chassis and a real delight to own carry and use.  I much prefer the tall professional 3:2 aspect ratio for increased content and do not mind black bars when watching video but the compromise is a cramped keyboard.<br /><br /> My version of this Plus II has the plastic shell.  Not impressed.  It creeks slightly.  In contrast  the Pro and Plus I are truly portable and have the look and feel of premium devices with state of the art screens.  Only complaint I have about the Pro is the terrible keyboard.  Pro  and Plus II have a true Quad HD screen nearly bezel-free which can not be rivaled.  This Plus II has a good bright screen but it is only HD and has a large bezel.  The overall feel of the Plastic Plus is so so.  No joy.  Hinge is too tight. It's a solid reliable utilitarian Chromebook equipped with Samsung's superior long life battery nothing more.  As far as using any of these as a tablet, no, I don't see the point.  Samsung can skip the convertible feature and either cut the price or make it thinner and lighter.<br /><br />  In summary I recommend the Plastic Plus if the price is right and you are not looking for an ultra portable Chromebook.  Build quality is better than average as is the reliability.  The Intel Celeron 3965Y is fast enough for average consumer use.  4GB ram is the minimum recommended.

The included C-PD charger is compact has a long cord and is suitable for charging most modern phones with USB C-PD.<br />If you do go portable then the 60 watt Ravpower RP-PB201 portable C-PD battery is a perfect mate for about $35 and will support fast charging while the Chromebook is in use."

This laptop is great for upgrading, as it has just 2-3 screws that can be easily taken out and has a big access door on the bottom for RAM/HD upgrades, nice job to acer for this. Also, it came with minimal bloatware, tho, windows 10 home sucks and is full of unwanted tiles and BS Apps. But you can get around all that, and even put &#34;classic shell&#34; on it to make it look useable!  Windows shell sucks. Anyway............  The computer is great...<br /><br />Pros<br />*long battery life.  I get around 8-9 hours.<br />*Screen is nice.  Full HD should be a standard anyway.<br />*7 Gen i3 CPU is speedy and allows the machines to use DDR4 RAM.<br />*Back lit keys is awesome at the price point<br />*The keyboard is &#34;FULL SIZE!&#34; They used up all the room and evenly spaced out the keys!<br />*Keyboard is actually really nice to type on (for this price point!)<br />*supports AC wireless (haven't tested)<br />*Has a USB C port, no need to buy an adapter.<br />*Has a nice texture plastic that won't attract fingerprints.<br />*Affordable!<br /><br />Cons:<br />*Only comes with 4Gigs but is simple to upgrade.<br />*Analog Hard Drive is slow!<br />However....Both can be upgraded pretty easily.<br />*It's a big big and heavy.  Nothing that any other laptop really is, but it's not a dell XPS...<br />*While the trackpad is a sort of an improvement, I still carry around a wireless mouse. It's nice to be able to turn on and off the touchpad with a function key, as do use it, and your are typing a paragraph, sometimes the touchpad get's in the way. I wish they could improve the touchpad more!<br /><br />Now a little side note, if you ever see an Intel Chip like this one... Intel Core i3-7100U... Most laptops use the &#34;U&#34; processors.  The &#34;U&#34; stands for ULTRA LOW Power Consumption... Means that for laptops that you want to get the most out of your battery ... they are going to have the U type processor.  Now, one thing to keep in mind, is that, all the &#34;U&#34; cpu's be it from i3, i5 or i7 are going to be set at the same 15 watts of power consumption. These aren't super fast CPU's, and they never will be, as you'll need more WATTS if you want more power... So the speed differences across the board of an i3, i5 and i7 are very very marginal. Yeah, you will see a slight performance gain going from i3 to an i7.  But only if you are doing intense cpu processing, for normal web browsing, google docs, or even MS windows ... You won't notice the speed hit of that 1000 ms faster to open a normal document.  Plus, if you are really intending to use photoshop where you are manipulating gigabyte images.... sure, the i7 is going to be faster, but it's still going to be INCREDIBLY SLOW!  As you wouldn't want to photoshop large images on a &#34;U&#34; processor.  I wouldn't, so you have to have realistic performance goals in mind. All this being said?  if you look at CPU BOSS, or PassMark differences between the gen 7 &#34;U&#34; CPU's ... One will notice that there isn't much difference so save you money and get this machine.  Unless you are the ultra geek that just wants to brag how that you got an i7, and your machine will load up your research paper 1/3000 of a sec faster than an i3!  haha. Best bet, save the cash for decent SSD witch will not just load it faster but boot it up faster as well!"

So, we were going to return it for this reason alone. After all, what good is a laptop with a dead battery....  So we followed all the suggestions from dell, like upgrading the drivers, and the bios.  Still no go.... Then we started looking at what others did and gone into the video drivers and the properties of the internet and unclicked let this device wake up computer.  Even did some other stuff that I can't remember.  This fixed it!<br /><br />So I cancelled the return and just the other day the computer is all HOT again, didn't really fix it just slowed it down.  So we like this computer so much we just figure, we will shut it down and set the lid close to shut down instead of sleep..

What the heck Dell?  I mean the keyboard feels cheap, as it has a really SHORT press.  But was something we could live with, but, now with stuck keys, and I go online to find this is happening to others, worse people call up dell, and say the space bar key isn't registering.  With dell telling them this isn't a defect and to suck it up?  NOPE! NOPE!!!!  The keyboard is a joke after looking at it more.  It's a really cheap --- to make the key return dell uses a foam type that will eventually break down over a few years... It's not exactly easy to replace the keyboard. So it's going back...<br /><br />This was a computer for my wife, she is coming from a heavy macbook pro, that lasted her 5 years.  It's sad, we can't find a &#34;GREAT&#34; replacement for apple because she likes windows....  But it's becoming clear that mac hardware is a step above the rest of the PC market.  Maybe we will try out a Zen Book.  If dell, could figure out how to fit a decent keyboard in it, and somehow make the machine sleep when it's told.... We would have kept this machine. I'd even had paid a few hundred more if there was an option upgrade for the keyboard.  I'm not sure if it's dell, windows or the new intel skylark having the problems.<br /><br />Bye DELL... Maybe next two or three XPS series and we can try again.  I was even thinking about getting one for myself.  PASS on this till the bugs are worked out.  esp, with the keyboard. This is NO macbook killer. Apple has a way better keyboard."

AGVO65TAROWVIZVT227P76LOBEPQ,B0829S536D,3,14,True,"I have had this AIO for only 10 days. I normally review products after a lengthy amount of time but a mistake that I made caused me to come online  right away and post this review now, with the chance to update later.<br /><br />Anyone with an intel socket 1700 motherboard (12th gen) needs to purchase the LGA 1700 bracket kit prior to mounting. It would have been nice of Corsair to actually include them for free. But they had it on their website for about $8. I purchased it elsewhere for half that price. The AIO does a decent job in performance. Unlike my previous AIO, it was fairly easy to setup. I don't care much for RGB lighting but the cooler/pump seems plain with RGB lighting around the border. It works well with iCUE software, monitoring temps for most areas on my motherboard, gpu, and cpu. But compared to other AIO software, it's lacking in some features. From what I can tell, it does somewhat of a decent job however...<br /><br />So why 3 stars and what was the mistake? The mistake was trusting the brand name of this product. Most coolers come with pre-applied thermal paste. I normally remove the pre-applied thermal paste and use my own. I went against my better judgement and mounted the cooler with the pre-applied paste. I was gaming earlier in the day and noticed a hitch during gameplay. I thought it was odd but kept playing. I have a 2 monitor setup so I have a couple of monitoring software (and the iCUE software) running every time I use my system. In between online games, I noticed my graphics card being very warm than usual (84c). I looked at my other monitoring programs and noticed that my cpu was running at a constant 100c! Shut down my game and the cpu temp dropped to 88c. I passed my hand on the top of my system and felt it was very hot. I proceeded to shutdown my system. I opened my case and removed the cooler/pump to find that the pre-applied thermal paste was completely dried up on both it, and the IHS (cpu). This is absolutely the reason for the high temps. I did notice the pre-applied paste was a super thin layer when I first got the AIO. But I thought, well, this is a Corsair product. I applied my preferred thermal paste, booted up my system, and I now have the normal idle temp range of 29-33c on the cpu. My cpu ran at 75c and gpu ran at 70c on full load when gaming again. My trust in the brand name nearly destroyed my cpu after 10 days of use with the AIO! Never again!<br /><br />Anyone who wish to purchase any products with pre-applied paste, don't ever use it. Don't make the same mistake that I did and use your preferred brand instead. I may give this AIO 1 extra star if the performance holds up like I expect it to. The manufacturer should either add a sufficient amount of pre-applied thermal paste or don't add any at all!"

If you want to save cash and get a strong CPU, then here's the deal.  I replaced my old 3rd Gen Intel I7-3770 with this one which bench marked a bit better than it. I got a 8th/9th Gen Motherboard to go with it.  Now I figure I have this for a year or two and then upgrade as needed to an Intel I5/I7/I9 9th Gen as needed. But for now my I3-9100F has plenty of power. There is no graphics included in the CPU so you'll need a graphics card. Then again most PC builders always get a Graphics card so this won't be a deal breaker. So, I'd snap this one up if you're an ""Intel-Guy"" but I'm sure if you can handle the setup then Ryzen CPU's probably offer more.  But I'm more of plug-n-go type. Also this one came with a Fan which was good. This is a ""Turbo"" CPU as well which saves you electricity when you're just doing low priority tasks. Update: This CPU is still going strong. I paired it with a GTX 1650 Super Gaming X 4GB DDR6 graphics card.  It's doing very well considering the cost versus more expensive CPU's that are out there. I also of 16GB of RAM. In this arrangement I can easily run a basic Hadoop setup on a VirtualBox (From Hortonworks sandbox (CDP)). They need about 12GB of RAM at least and about 50GB + HardDrive space. But, this can push those newer games but will struggle a bit on the most demanding games. For those you'll need an I5 9th gen or greater for you super gamers out there.

In fact I used by prior board instructions as a reference.  Things like when to install the I/O shield are left out that catch 1st time builders. The diagrams given by Intel on how to install a CPU were golden and lacking for this board. But I guess with YouTube to the rescue, no worries there.  Overall this is a solid board. Having 4 ram slots was a must for future expansion. Being able to handle 8th and 9th Gen CPU's is great for future scalability. Sure you can go out and spend more on a board but why?

I was attracted by the inclusion of image stabilization as well as picture quality. I was impressed with the quality of the pictures from this camera. I do a lot of Photoshop work and this camera automatically makes pictures that are so sharp and bright it takes all the work out of getting sparkling sharp pictures.<br /><br /> There are also loads of special features which are just plain fun to use such as the mirror image function. You can make  all sorts of freaky  faces of yourself and others.  The image stabilization takes the jerkiness out of pictures especially movies and gives them a smooth floaty appearance,within limits.  About the only decision you have to make is the quality of picture. I set mine on high. Don't try flash with Intelligent Auto. One cool feature is back light control. I often see people lining up their family in front of a landmark with the sun coming from the rear. With ordinary cameras you get bad results but using the HDR back light setting you can get away with it.<br /><br />This is not a pro camera as it only shoots in JPEG although you can use Photoshop on it. You don't get raw images. If viewed at high power some images can be waxy. It uses screen viewing only,no eye piece. Uses touch screen or traditional  button pushing picture taking . I am a touch screen fan. There is no GPS. It will work with wi -fi  but  it requires a special card for this. It works best at lower magnification . It has tremendous optical zoom power but it is really hard to see what you are doing at high power on the touch screen.

AEZND6QFUXS7MCGHTIUXGBL5AV2A,B004HYFX0C,5,5,False,"First I would like to tell the story why I chose this camera.  Half a year ago, my old Panasonic camera fell to the ground once again and it still worked, but I thought it was time I should get a new one.  And what I most wanted was that it must have large optical zooms, wide angle lens, and a plus would be if my hand shakes it could still take a nice picture.  One day I was in Costco warehouse and played all the point-and-shoot cameras side-by-side.  I tested them by taking picture of a package box far away.  I compared Nikon, Canon, Olympus, Panasonic and a Sony HX-7V.  The Sony's picture was most impressive.  Although when I zoomed to the 16x optical, the package box in the LCD view was so shaking that I was afraid that I could take a good picture, after I pushed the button, the picture was so sharp as if there was no shaking.  When playing back, I could zoom in the picture and the small characters on that box was so clear that I could read them without problem.  All the other cameras could not do that.  So I decided I would buy a Sony.  When HX-9V was on sale last October, I immediately bought it since it has 1080p video that the HX-7V doesn't have.  Now I have owned this camera for almost 4 months.  Many friends have recently bought DSLR but I am not moved because I want no more than this camera can do.  Sure the DSLR's picture quality is better, but this camera is good enough for me.  Although it is not as compact and light as some model, it provides me more powerful functions than they do.  Since it is the best point-and-shoot that I have owned so far, and it already helped me record a lot of unforgettable moments of my family in videos and pictures, it deserves my compliment.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  - 16.2 mega pixels:  Good enough<br />  - 16x Optical Zoom:  So that I can shoot an object far away<br />  - 24mm wide angle lens:  So I can take a picture of a crowd of people without problem.<br />  - 1080p video (1920x1080 at 60fps) with stereo microphone:  What I can say is the video quality is just stunning.  Playing the video on my HDTV is just like watching an HD channel.  Now my Panasonic camcorder will sleep in my drawer forever.<br />  - image stabilization: Also amazing, I can take a crisp picture of a moving object without need to worry if I hold the camera stably enough, or the object is moving too faster, as long as I can catch it I can take a nice picture.<br />  - Panorama mode:  I can sweep a lot of things in one wide picture.<br />  - battery life:  I have no complaint yet.  After a full charge, the battery can hold power for several weeks without problem.<br />  - GPS locator and 3D: I haven't used those feature yet, but they are not bad to have.<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - The time between pressing the shutter and completing writing the picture to the SD card may take several seconds which seems to be a little long, but the progress bar shows me that the camera first captures the picture and processes the data which takes about 1 second and writing data takes about 5 seconds when I take pictures indoors.  When taking pictures outdoors, it is much faster.  I don't know if that is the camera performance or the card performance.<br />  - The flash's position is awkward.  It is on the top left where I normally put my left index finger with my thumb on the left bottom to hold the camera.  But I have got used to it by moving my left index finger to the left side.<br /><br />Regarding shooting the pictures indoors or under dim lighting conditions, using the flash in Super Intelligent Auto mode I can take sharp pictures without problem.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />With all the good stuff it has, I am pretty happy with my purchase because I know I cannot get a product that can meet all my expectations.  I haven't found a second camera that have all the features that I care, so I give it a 5 star without hesitation.<br /><br />Finally, some suggestions for others:  If you haven't decided which one to buy, write down a priority list: What features are must-have, what features are a plus, and what features are not bad to have?  Keep your budget in your mind, and then go to one warehouse or or two, compare all the cameras available there, write down your feelings for each model you tested, you may then have some idea on which one to buy.  If budget is met, get it.  Otherwise, if time permits, wait for several months till it's on sale, just like me.  Don't trust those numbers in the specification, the actual feeling can be totally different.  For example, I compared three different brand cameras that all have 16x optical zoom, but they are not the same, or even similar.  Only trust your feeling.  You don't want to spend a couple of hundreds of bucks to get something with fancy specifications but when you use it you're not happy."

These are available from various online vendors, or you can make your own.<br /><br />The 32 MB add-on will unlock the full potential of the platform, and it is available for only $25-35 from various members of the MISTer community.  The 32 MB board is required for platforms such as the NES, SNES, Amiga, or Sega Master System.<br /><br />I got my 32 MB upgrade from ""zerohimself"" on etsy for only $28, shipped.<br /><br />In addition to MISTer, the DE-10 Nano is a powerful FPGA/ARM hybrid platform for students and hobbyists.  The board is a loss-leader for intel, containing $300 worth of hardware for only $130; so if you are a Computer Engineering student or a hobbyist/DIYer, this is a great value for learning to use FPGAs, alongside playing games.  Maybe you will even join the MISTer development community!<br /><br />Thanks to the ARM cores, you can even run a full desktop version of linux, which you can boot straight from the MISTer platform, if you like!<br /><br />If anything I have mentioned sounds even slightly interesting, you should totally get one!

The primary drive (which was included with the laptop) is a 250 GB  Sandisk.<br /><br />Basically, this Intel drive seems solid, but the problem is it runs VERY hot and it SUCKS power and it is obviously VERY expensive.  Before installing this thing my laptop was cool as a cucumber and could run for up to 10 hours on battery.<br /><br />After installing this this, my computer feels like a firecracker from the side that this hard drive is installed.  Also, my battery life is 6 hours max, and much less if I am actively using this thing...<br /><br />All in all, i am terribly disappointed with my choice.  I think i will just grab another sandisk or a samsung (which will undoubtedly be less expensive) and i will convert this hard drive to an external drive or use it in a home computer application of some time...<br /><br />DO NOT USE THIS FOR YOUR LAPTOP!<br /><br />Oh yeah, and i ripped off the stupid skull sticker and replaced it with butterfly stickers... because... butterflies, man!

I've had it for about a week now; so this is more of a first impressions type review.<br /><br />This is a very good value for your money.  It is advertised as a gaming laptop, and while it doesn't match the high end features of my previous laptop (Qosmio), it makes up for them in other ways.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Nice size/weight.<br />-Great &#34;bang for yer buck&#34;<br />-No bloatware (accept McAffe)<br />-6th gen quad core i5<br />***it can be difficult to know just what you are getting due to intel's pathetic CPU naming scheme.  This particular i5 is very similar to a standard i7.  Pretty much, the only difference is that you don't get hyperthreading with this CPU.  It really depends on what kind of software you are running if this matters much.  Lots of games depend more on the GPU, and maybe aren't even multi-threaded.  You will only see a performance hit on multi-threaded software.***<br /><br />-decent video card (Nvidia 960 with 4GB)<br />-switch between Intel and Nvidia gfx<br />***you can choose (per application) which video card to use.  Intel for light-duty (saves a good deal of battery)  Nvidia for heavy-duty.  See the pictures below.  You right-click on the desktop and select &#34;NVidia Control Panel.&#34;  Then per-application, you can choose if which card that you want to use.  In this case, I want to use the NVidia card for Unity 3D.  So, I select it from the dropdown, and make sure to hit &#34;apply.&#34;  If you don't see your application, you can add it to the list by pressing the &#34;Add&#34; button.***<br /><br />-8GB system memory on one stick<br />***this could be a pro or a con, if you plan to upgrade to 16 GB, you can find a matching 8GB and you don't have to &#34;re-buy&#34; ram you already have.  OTOH, you don't get dual channel memory as you would with a 4x2 configuration***<br /><br />-open hard drive bay<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />-The screen is not nearly as pretty as the ads from Dell would have you believe.  The luminous glory of the screen on my Qosmio  would have made this screen impossible to see if you put them side by side (just kidding).  Even my phone's screen is MUCH NICER (Note 4).  Also, some other people pointed out that the color gamut is highly inaccurate, and there is some screen bleed around the edges in low-light situations and black screens.  Honestly, it's not the worst but it's not the greatest either.<br /><br />If you buy the laptop on Dell's website, you can get a 4k touchscreen.  no idea what that is like... prolly slaughters the GPU, though...<br /><br />-The subwoofer is a COMPLETE JOKE.  It has a 1 inch diameter.  you can barely even tell it is there.  I'm not even sure why they bothered.  There is an included &#34;DELL Audio&#34; app which allows you to add compression and equallization to your system sound.  It  succeeds is making the laptop sound MUCH LOUDER (it is on by default), but at the expense of adding some noticeable distortion when playing certain audio programs.  (Final Fantasy 13-2 is a noticeable offender).  I use headphones, often, so that helps... some<br /><br />-The headphone jack... has problems.  it definitely sounds muddy through decent headphones (Sennhieser HD280).  Also, it doubles as a mic input, so you have to choose what you just inserted from a pop-up menu, and you have to have a special adapter to use a separate mic.  You definitely won't be doing any high-quality recording with this input (it is relegated to 16 bit/48khz).  Of course, you wouldn't expect that from a laptop anyway.  if you need good sound, you should think about an external solution.<br /><br />-The overall port scene is somewhat lacking.  There are 3 USB ports (all 3.0), an HDMI port, the aforementioned headphone/mic port, ethernet, a card reader...  that's it.  I would like to see a VGA or a displayport (or 2 HDMI, at least) and more USB ports (at least one more)  oh well, get what ya pay for in this instance."

AGASSZ3UC5J6RIM5YX2EAQ3RMROA,B010NS1LVA,4,22,True,"The cooler itself works great.  I was able to get nearly a 40-degree C drop, almost 100F, in CPU temp.  It's well designed and feels built to last.<br /><br />However, the manual is one of the WORST I've seen, and here's why I say so:<br /><br />1) The diagrams are well drawn, except for one of the most important parts - the standoff screws - where you have to differentiate between screw size. If you look at Step 2, the screws are very poorly drawn.<br /><br />2) In the Intel section, the manual mentions NOTHING about color coding, a CRUCIAL discernment, again for the standoff screws. Screws for AMD are black, and Intel are grey/gun metal. You absolutely cannot tell them apart by looking at the manual. Were it not for looking up an installation video, I would have used the wrong ones and had to re-apply the heat sink compound. You have to read the AMD section in order to see that the AMD screws are black.<br /><br />3) There's nothing in the manual about the backplate having &quot;play&quot; once the standoff screws are attached. Luckily, this appears to be normal. This disconcerting anomaly was the reason I sought help in the first place.<br /><br />4) If you plan to use the fans inside the chassis, common sense would tell you to attach the fans before mounting the radiator, but again, no word from the manual.<br /><br />5) &quot;Step 5: Connect Power to Fans and Pump.&quot; Horrible. On my unit, the H110i GTX, there are FOUR power cables coming off the water pump, and they have: a) a SATA connection; b) a 3-pin connection; c) a 4-pin connection; d) a 1-pin connection. The manual states:<br /><br />&quot;Connect the pump power cable to the CPU_FAN header on your motherboard.&quot; No. There is no SATA connection on my motherboard, nor, I believe, on ANY stock motherboard.<br /><br />&quot;Connect the fans to the two connectors coming off the pump.&quot; Again, the connectors coming off the pump have 3- and 4-pins. The fan connectors will fit into either pump connector. Which one goes to which? And finally, where does that leave the 1-pin??? By trial-and-error, I figured out that you should attach it to the CPU_FAN header.<br /><br />Corsair should be strongly chastised for this wholly inadequate manual. You spend, in my case, $140 USD, and you expect not to have to make assumptions about critical issues. I might have been better off throwing the manual away."

AFIGB44OAEOBQPBWTN72C3NAOURA,B000GBHT8E,4,0,True,"I bought the D13RI after a brief encounter with the 15"" N15RI.  That unit died after a week of use but hopefully was just a lemon and not typical.  I've now had the 13.3"" D13RI for 3 weeks of heavy use and had no real problems.  But since I've had experience with both I'll try to compare them here as you can't find them in stores.<br /><br />I like the looks of the D13.  It's not as sleek as an Apple or Vaio,but the carbon fibre look on the outside is more attractive than the painted metal on the N15RI.  The overall sizing is comfortable both for desk work and hauling around in a briefcase.  Set up is easy with very little software preloaded.  Keyboard and touchpad have a nice feel.  i HAVE HAD PROBLEMS WITH THE wIfI AND MY GENERAL IMPRESSION IS THAT THE RECEPTION IS NOT AS GOOD ON THIS UNIT AS SOME OTHER NOTEBOOKS AND THAT THE iNTEL WIFI SOFTWARE SOMETIMES GETS CONFUSED.  Sorry about the caps.  Battery life is good, definitely will ad more ram to try and improve speed.  Biggest gripe is lack of connectivity.  It has only 2 USB ports (both on the right side) , could use two more on the other side (where the power cable goes), needs firewire and a card reader and bluetooth would be nice (apparently available on the 14"" model).  bUT DEFINITELY NEEDS MORE THAN 2 usb CONNECTIONS IN THE MODERN WORLD (MY PORTABLE HARDDRIVE REQUIRES 2 BY ITSELF. N15RI has 3 USB and firewire...still not much but better.  Haven't really tested the durability...not brave enough to pour liquid on it or drop it, but read several reviews that suggested it is durable...got to be better than my last two (Acer and HP, both disasters).  Certainely a lot cheaper than Panasonic toughbook, but I wonder if it's really a better choice than recent offerings from Toshiba and Fujistsu that offer spill resitant keyboards and harddrive protection in more sophisticated machines.  All in all happy with it and like the size and form factor much better than the similar but bulky N15RI. Also it does not run nearly as hot as the N15RI.

AGFKJ74TFHMOXTKANZGBZ7UWNG3Q,B000GWDMX4,4,3,False,"Just purchased this thing a week ago.  Despite what another reviewer wrote, I found this easy to use, once I became familiar with it.  (the 'guardian' feature goes away--just click ok, and after 5 times it is gone for good)  The picture quality is excellent, the unit allows you to watch a show from DVD or HDD while recording another to HDD, and it is pretty quiet.  It also has all the inputs/outputs that almost anyone could want.  The 'Yes' Video option to automatically split content into chapters for recording is very nice.  Cons:  Remote is pretty weak, and not laid out very intelligently/intuitively.  Titles for recorded content are limited to 8 characters, and the unit runs fairly hot. (could use a fan to keep the HDD cool)  It also lacks fine control over color, bitrates, and other misc. settings you will find on higher end units.  Overall, I'm very happy with this unit.

AFSOLCMUPPFZ3U45KPKEBE4AV5QQ,B003N636VI,4,0,True,"This product is fantastic; however, be aware that if you are using it with a PC you will need a decent sound card. My Intel motherboard did not have the extra punch to make these headphones sound very good and they actually were terrible until I bought the inexpensive Sound Blaster Audigy FX PCIe sound card by Creative. Once upgrading to the Creative card, these headphones sound beautiful and brings a whole new experience not only to gaming but also music and movies. The difference with the sound card is incredible.<br /><br />You cant beat the price if you want an integrated microphone and maintain high quality audio. Like others have said, you have to make sure the mic is orientated so the slits in it are facing your mouth, otherwise it may be hard for others to hear your correctly. I recommend that you use the Microsoft Windows &#34;set up a microphone&#34; tool (in Windows 7, type 'microphone' in the start menu) and that way you can hear yourself speaking and adjust it accordingly.<br /><br />This would be 5 stars if not for the issue with the microphone orientation; but otherwise it is a great purchase. The issues is minor if you just keep track of how the mic is oriented when you start speaking. I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could."

It is a nice looking device and the screen is gorgeous but it is not really ready for prime time unless your a cook or you want to video communicate and have two.  I tried to video comm with my brother and he had to load the Alexa App on his phone before we were able to.  There are lots of applications that have been around for years like skype, messenger, youtube and more recently youtube music just to name a few this device does not take advantage of.  My old Philips LED TV does much better than this device.  It isn't able to run facebook, MeWe or any social media that I was able to discover.  Now you might be saying that most of these apps will run on a PC and I agree.  When run they take up real estate on the screen...

AG47MYNOV7GGIQ3RVTC2JQAL6XPQ,B01NBL8BER,5,1,False,"I’ve been using this computer for a several weeks now and continue to be very happy with both its abilities and appearance. It has an intelligent combination of components that hits the sweet spot of giving you the most performance for the dollar without adding bells and whistles that don’t substantially improve its operating capacity. Most of the expense is just where you’d want it to be--the video card, memory and processor.<br /><br />That said, it’s also beautiful. The case is made of heavy gauge steel and the paint job is flawless. It was designed by Cooler Master, a company (my husband tells me) with a good reputation.<br /><br />My husband has long been an avid gamer so he’s particular and usually builds our computers, but he was impressed with the care put into the interior construction of Cyberpowerpc Gamer Xtreme. According to him, the cabling system is very well organised and clean--it’s not a rats nest. The case has a cable backplate so the cables are routed away from the motherboard, allowing it to stay cool. There are 3 case fans, 2 in the front and 1 in the back, and these have LED lights, which definitely makes for a cool aesthetic. (There are also fans on the CPU, videocard, and power supply.) Another nice ventilation property is the removable dust screen which simplifies the task of cleaning the computer to ensure good airflow. There’s room inside to add additional drives and the bays are designed for tool free installations.<br /><br />There’s only one slot for a video card, but the installed card beat my husband’s (admittedly older) 2 video card computer in a benchmark test (he’s since gotten himself a new card). I tested the system using the Unigine Heaven 4.0 benchmarking tool. For Directx11 at medium quality, AAx4, 1920x1080 I got an average frame rate of 95.7, score of 2411 with a max frame rate of 177 and a minimum of 25.1. The GPU is the Radeon Rx 480 4 gig using the i5 7400 CPU @ 3.0 Mhz.<br /><br />I was actually impressed with Gamer Xtreme even before I ever turned it on because it came packaged so carefully with sturdy materials, and was padded so thoroughly--even in its interior--that it would be highly unlikely to be damaged during shipping.<br /><br />Another huge plus for me is that Gamer Xtreme  did not come with any bloatware.<br /><br />I did have to wait a few days to set up this computer because its video card only has an HDMI slot, which meant I needed to order an (inexpensive) adapter for my monitor to work.<br /><br />I’ve been having lots of fun using this computer both for regular web browsing and (of course!) gaming, but I had a few questions and had trouble getting answers using the online site. That didn’t turn out to be a problem though, because I called the customer service and technical support phone number and they were great. There was only a short wait before I was talking to a very courteous representative who quickly helped me with all my issues."
AFSGDN42QW65JV76MQJBKSUW5G2A,B07P5C759M,5,1,True,"So, picture quality in HDR mode is amazing. I want to know what kind of HDR it is. It can go up to 800 nits which isn't that bad for 11.6-inch monitor tbh. I enabled HDR and went to change the color setting to standard setting only. I would suggest a monitor expert to look into this or call out Monitor Rtings to check it out because I need to understand what colors to change to calibrate this monitor. However, I just increased in saturation through AMD Software adrenaline and picture with HDR on, on both the monitor and windows looked much better. This monitor performance isn't really bad. I'm actually happy with it. I'm switching to small gaming PC with minimalist set up for my comfort and this gave me even better experience than Razer Raptor 27. It got a nice, weird setting that no monitor has which is praiseworthy is that you can set the setting of your HDMI to either 2.0 or 2.1 which can be helpful for PC users who got Ray tracing GPUs on their system. I'm happy that I have downgraded from Razer Raptor 27 to be honest and the trade worth for the number of options in the menu setting of this monitor such as controlling the backlight, Image sharpening, HDMI setting from (1.4, 2.0, 2.1), it is a flicker-free monitor from my monitor and it does a setting for low blue light but it just need adjusting in terms of having low blue light and HDR at the same time. I would just suggest JohnWill company to release another revision of this model. I would ask the people to try and ask for Nvidia and AMD to support such small monitors such as JohnWill's with AMDFreeSync and Nvidia G-sync. This doesn't mean that this monitor doesn't come with a sync. It does not but its own sync works well and fine. I lost on trying to open the 2nd menu because it got 2nd menu for adjusting the settings in detail in terms of color so that is on me. I hope someone who is more intelligent in that case than me to be able to find out who and make notes to help. I completely support this product and I'm satisfied with this monitor. Oh yeah did I mention that it is indeed IPS. Most monitors don't have built in speaker which is to me a good trade off than the scammy expensive Razer Raptor 27 that keeps crashing and turning off without coming back on me THAT GOT REPLACED WITH REVISION MODEL 2 OR 3 AND STILL GOT SAME PROBLEMS AS BACKLIGHT DIMS AND LIGHT UP EVEN WHEN I MOVE MY MOUSE...<br /><br />So, $130 worth the price for how much stuff in it. People with minimalist set ups and don't longer want to invest in big cluster phobic set ups should aim at this area of innovation.<br /><br />I would say the next thing is to focus on making the HDMI-to-HDMI mini cable longer<br />Make USB port for power longer.<br />Make a remote for the monitor instead of back buttons for ease of use and comfort then you can raise the price a bit for about 10 to 15 dollars.<br />Mostly focus on areas where it isn't focused on that consumer target most.<br />Change the stand. It always falls frontward which is kind of laughable to be honest.<br />Make a 1200p version & 1440p versions.<br />Monitor is smooth but not smoother.<br /><br />NOTE: Review writer can change his mind anytime depending on the experience been received through this product. Been a week or two and so far, nothing happened thankfully.<br /><br />I appreciate it and thank you for taking the time to read this review.<br /><br />I appreciate it."

AHA2764AERLEX6VB5SOTMTXPSZSQ,B076HX3BX4,4,19,True,"First off; this is THE BEST ""RUN & GUN"" video camera, on the market!  And trust me; I've tried MANY!  (if you may disagree, with me; by all means PLEASE give me details...because I'm in the minority, of people, who actually LOVES TO BE PROVEN WRONG; especially when I can benefit from any further education/knowledge, etc.).  Now.... this is to what my ""BUT"", in the above headline, pertains: THE LOW LIGHT CAPABILITY, OF THIS CAMERA, BY USING, SPECIFICALLY, THE ""LOW LUX"" SETTING, IS INSANELY GOOD!!!  AND BEYOND THE ""LOW LUX"" BEING FANTASTIC, WHAT IMPRESSED ME, IS THAT IT CAN BE USED IN THE ""INTELLIGENT AUTO"" MODE!!!!  Now; HERE'S the ""BUT"" that's very frustrating: This camera is a ""smart cam"" (like your phone is a ""smart phone""), which means that it has a mind of its own, and therefore sometimes THINKS it's smartly doing something GOOD, when it's really doing something BAD.  Even more specific is the ""low lux"" setting, as well as some others, whereby sometimes the ""low lux"" setting selection will be greyed out, and unable to use, and there is truly no ryme or reason for this, because other times, with the cam mode not being changed, the low lux feature will NOT be greyed out, and therefore can be used.  To possibly explain this, a better way, here's an example: I was shooting an event, and using the low lux setting, and loving every minute of my experience, but after a short break, after turning the cam back on (NOT CHANGING ANYTHING....), I noticed that the low lux feature was now OFF.  So; I figured ""no problem, maybe 'OFF' is the default setting or whatever"", so I went to re-select it as 'ON' and that's when I found it greyed out.  WORSE YET; for the LIFE of me; I could NOT get the low lux setting back!!!!!!!  I tried EVERYTHING....switching to manual...auto...and back to intelligent auto, and NOTHING!  Right now, at this moment, I'm going to re-try...since I'm not under any ""at event pressure"", and will attempt to see what's what...  Maybe I should have done that, BEFORE wtiting all of this, but I then figured it's probably a good idea to write it, since this negative occurance may have happened to anyone else, and maybe they (i.e. YOU; if such applies to you) would like to PLEASE EDUCATE ME?!?!?!?!?  I'M DYING FOR SOME ASSISTANCE, ON THIS, BECASUE AGAIN; I TRULY DO LOVE THIS CAMERA!  THE PICTURE QUALITY IS OVER THE TOP, AND THE CAM'S OVERALL FEATURES ARE EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN WANTING! (yea; I'd love to be able to shoot 4K at 60fps, which cannot be done, with this cam, but THAT is far outweighed by the ability to shoot UHD at 120fps!!!  Now THAT'S IMPRESSIVE!"
AFRWSE6EGJOFNI3POBEAFP25FYCA,B00HUNUOJW,3,19,True,"I wrote this review mainly to display the functionality of the controls on the Xiaomi Pistons themselves. I tested the headset on my LG Nexus 4 (Android OS), an LG Optimus T (Android OS), and a Nokia Lumia 521 (Windows Phone OS). Surprisingly enough, only the Lumia 521 displayed full functionality when it came to the onboard controls on the headset itself. None of the two Android devices I tested were able to recognize the full range of controls on the headset.<br /><br />I first tested these buds on my Nexus 4 (Android), which is my main phone. I used Spotify to test the functionality of the controls, as I did with all of the other devices. Single-click pause/play functionality was good. Double-click skip functionality worked fine for the first few uses, but after some time I had to triple click in order to skip the song. Triple-click to previous functionality did not work at all, nor did any of the volume controls. When it came to calls, I was able to pick-up, ignore, and end calls just fine using the headset. The long-click voice command prompt functionality was fine, except that it opened constantly when I tried to skip songs using the headset. It was crucial that I clicked at just the right amount of speed to skip a song. Also, clicking both the volume and the center control on the headset turned on the voice command prompt, which happened quite frequently because the buttons on the headset are placed a bit awkwardly. The thing about my Nexus 4 is that I replaced the audio jack when the previous one failed to operate correctly. I thought that may be the issue as to why the headset did not work with my phone, so I tried the headset on two other devices.<br /><br />The second device I tested this headset on was the Nokia Lumia 521 (Windows). Like I mentioned before, this device displayed the full functionality of the controls on this headset. Single-click pause/play functionality was good. Double-click skip functionality was good. Triple-click previous functionality was good. I was able to pick-up, end, and ignore calls just fine, and the long-click voice prompt was fine as well. The volume controls synced perfectly with the Lumia 521, and you could see the volume level display go up and down on the phone itself when using them.<br /><br />The last device I tested was the LG Optimus T (Android). I did not test the call functionality on this device, only the music control functionalities. Single-click pause/play functionality was fine. Double-click functionality was very unstable, unstable to the point that I could not get a clear reading on how many clicks it actually took to skip a song. Triple-click previous functionality did not work. Long-click voice prompt functionality was fine. Volume controls did not work.<br /><br />Although the range of devices I used for this test were not ideal, they were the only available devices that I had. I bought this headset solely under the impression that it was built to function best with an Android phone. Unfortunately, it did not meet my expectations, and in fact was only able to function fully on a Windows phone and none of the Android phones.<br /><br />Although I wrote this review mainly to exhibit the functionality of the headset controls on various devices, I'd like to note the sound quality as well. I'm not an audiophile by any means, and I really could care less about the range between lows and highs as long as both sides of a headset work. I was quite pleasantly surprised, though, when I tried on the Xiaomi Pistons. I listened to various genres, from classical to rock to electronica to film music. The instrumentation on the songs I listened to was crisp and clear. The earphones were also able to deliver both the lows and the highs quite effectively. No, I'm not talking about the range. I'm referring to the intelligibility of the sounds at both the low end and the high end. You could make out the full range of instruments and sounds used on both ends, which was something I did not notice on my cheaper earphones. I asked my brother, who is more a bit more experienced with audio than I am, to test these earbuds out. I did not tell him the price of these earphones. Of course, he looked up the price himself, but he maintained that the headset did sound a lot more expensive than the price it was sold at. If the controls did not meet my expectations, the sound quality definitely did shine through them.<br /><br />As an extra note, I bought these headphones from the third-party seller BOAT2014 for about $24. Based on the images on the listing above, the Xiaomi Pistons I received seem to be the genuine original product.<br /><br />UPDATE: BOAT2014 is no longer selling these headphones, so guess there was an issue with their headphones. Based on various images and videos on the internet my earphones seem to be a genuine pair, although I will try to get in contact with the original manufacturer to see if they really are. It doesn't quite help that there are three websites with the word Xiaomi in it and all are selling the same pair of earphones.<br /><br />UPDATE 2: Confirmed. Volume controls for the Xiaomi Pistons will not work on a Nexus 4 device. Other people on the web are having the same problem as well. If you have a Nexus 4 and the volume controls do work, however, let us know. Also, I found a workaround for the triple click previous functionality. You have to download an app called ""Jays Headset Control"" and change the target media player to the player of your choice through the advanced controls in the app."

AG6WKRX263MZU3ZPQFYNTQ56SW3A,B000MX0V9A,5,1,False,"I have owned this camera for over a year and am very happy with it. It is my everyday camera around the house.  Originally I purchased it after reading reviews while searching for a camera to use to shoot pictures of stage productions at our local HS. After using it for two seasons of productions, I love it's size, handling, silent operation, superzoom and intelligent ISO features for stage work.<br /><br />I recently went on a band and choir tour with our local HS.  I planned on taking my DSLR setup (I stopped using my DSLR on around the stage because it does not have a completely silent shutter) with multiple lenses and a camcorder, since I would be shooting stills and video of their activities and performances.  In the end, I decided to leave my fancy setup at home and only take the DMC-FZ8. I shot inside the bus (most of the pictures with the backlight windows), outdoors and on the stage. I was most nervous about the quality of the video and audio.  In the end, I was surprised with the video and audio results.  In one video some of the students where standing on some some red rock formations in Southern UT singing.  I was 150 feet away and also below them outdoors and the audio was clear.  I was surprised.  Throughout the four days, I used every setting the camera has.  And to think I didn't have to change a lens!  My DSLR would have been a handling nightmare trying to catch candid action shots of the students.  One disappointment with this model is that you cannot change the zoom while shooting video.  Of, course the DMC-FZ28K has that feature.  I also want Panasonic to add a hot shoe feature to the camera line so I could use a tilt and swivel flash.  I love Panasonic cameras, excellent value and great results. I own two other models."

What I have been looking for is a camera is easy to handle and that can take good pictures in low light without a flash.  You might say that I am the un-offical photographer for a local high school choir and drama department, since my spouse is the teacher.  The low light and the dance moves associated with stage productions are really challenging to photograph. I just don't like the size of the DSLR and changing lenses about the stage without disturbing the audience too much.  I have found the this DMC-FZ28K fits the bill.  I am very happy with the camera features, value ($299) and the results.  I especially like the intelligent ISO mode and the big zoom (I can really fill the frame with close ups). It works for me.  All I need is dark clothes, a tripod, the FZ28K, and a gentle touch. The students love the pictures and they have been very helpful to teach the student the visual aspects of their performances. One girl said, ""Oh, now I have to pay attention on stage, I never know when you are going to take my picture!"""
AFEQCRATU7B4TWMWHXPO73AAFOIA,B06XSXX3NS,1,2,True,"Intel and its motherboard partners do not make it clear how to configure optane.  No documentation on the box or manual.  Intel requires very specific BIOS settings that you will never guess.  You have to search online to find the download site for optane and the user guide to install and configure.  Also, if you are like me, upgrading to a optane ready motherboard, you will be transferring your drive with Win 10 on it.  It will not be a fresh install of Win 10.  But WAIT, Intel does not tell you that YOU MUST setup the BIOS first especially with the CSM disabled prior to installing Win 10 otherwise optane can't be enabled, EVER!  Who has the time to reinstall Win 10 and all of your software.  Not to mention it took a long time to configure software and your desktop environment in a personal manner.  No I have to say avoid this at all cost.  Additionally, since this does not work because I refuse to reinstall my OS, I have to remove the optane stick so it does not hurt the hard drive performance.  Yes you heart it, your hard drive will take a HUGE performance hit even though optane is not configure all because of how the BIOS was configured.  And you have to revert all BIOS changes too.  If they fix the issue with having to reinstall Win 10, then this might be worth the time."
AFEQCRATU7B4TWMWHXPO73AAFOIA,B07HCY7K9L,2,8,True,"The motherboard is good.  But its supposed to be optane ready which it is is partly.  Also, Asus does not provide instructions with how to configure optane.  You have to go to Intel online and guess where to find the user guide to install and configure the BIOS, drivers, and software.  The box does not even tell you that when upgrading like I did, optane will not work if you are transferring your hard drive with Win 10 on it.  That is because Intel requires that CSM be disabled in the BIOS prior to install Win 10 from scratch.  So I have a board that I can't use optane with unless I reinstall windows and days worth of software not to mention a configuration nightmare that took a lot over time to get right.  Lastly, you have to remove the optane stick if you are in the same boat as me otherwise it degrades your hard drive performance.  And you have to revert all of the BIOS changes you made to get it to work.  Intel and its hardware partners like Asus REALLY NEED TO INFORM ITS BUYERS ABOUT THIS REQUIREMENT TO AVOID THIS SITUATION!"

Each CB has had it's strong points, whether it was screen quality, keyboard, battery life, etc.  I purchased this one because I wanted to test out the Rockchip system.  I prefer 4gb RAM, but even with 4gb, some models were slower than others.  So, I went into this purchase with no particular expectations - just wanted to see how the Rockchip performance compared with the Intel and Tegra models.<br /><br />This model surprised me with its performance.  It's snappy and moves along quite nicely.  I've tested it with 7-8 tabs open, including music and video, with virtually no degradation in performance.  I am impressed.<br /><br />The screen is a no glare, and works fine for me at 1536x864.  It's not on the caliber of the Acer 13&#34; 1080P, or the Toshiba 2 IPS, but it suits my purposes quite well.  The keyboard is a standard Asus, and as long as I have the right angle, I can still get my 100 words / min speed (I am a copywriter).  The battery life is close to 9 hours, more than adequate.

Its size is just the right size for a living room, so it isn't intrusive. Its pyramid shape with a low profile is a great idea because it allows you to plug in using just one hand, instead of two with (as is the case with a tower strip).<br />The cord is strong and feels safe and secure and it's flexible enough not to be a struggle to move the pyramid around and not trying to tilt it (some strips won't stay flat because of rigidity of the cord).<br />Also, the design makes it impossible to knock it over because of its round bottom and a low height, and yet thick and weighty enough to stay in place. I had a tower type strip and it was a headache.<br />The strip has 6 standard outlets, which is a sweet-spot number, plus they all can be used at the same time.<br />The switch (on/off) is intelligently placed on top of the ""pyramid"" and not on the side or elsewhere, so again just one hand is needed. And it has a protective cover, which you can remove and make the switch accessible 24/7 or keep it on if there are kids or pets in the house to prevent accidental stepping on it. All in all, a great device. Hope it lasts."
AE2FSQBLAI537DYPUXRJHM4OPK3Q,B07B3XQF7B,5,0,True,"I have been using the Skytech Omega with 6-core i7 3.7 GHZ CPU & Intel-8700K graphics card for about 6 months primarily for complex 3-D graphics rendering applications. When replacing an iMac became necessary the cost of this machine when compared with any Apple machine with anything anywhere near equivalent specs was an absolute no-brainier. The Skytech plus a decent UHD display was less than half the cost. As to performance, this machine is amazingly fast. It does complex 3-D renders in about 1/10 the time of the first generation quad-core i7. The Windows 10 OS is stable and runs 64-bit graphics software flawlessly; speed is not noticably affected by anti-virus software. There is no bloatware pre-installed. The machine boots up in seconds and opens apps just as fast. There is no significant difference in the major 3-D graphics or photo editing apps on the Windows vs. Apple platforms, and all of the commonly used graphics file formats translate the files from the Mac to Windows without any difficulties. Of course, Apple's proprietay apps do not run on Windows, something to consider if you are editing a lot video.<br /><br />One thing to consider also is that  if you are planning to use any applications with large libraries of graphic elements (think CAD architectural or 3-D design apps) is that the 250 GB SSD will probably be barely adequate in terms of storage space; it may not accommodate huge library of graphic element in addition to several productivity applications as well.  This machine also comes with a fast 2 TB hard drive, which is plenty adequate. The problem is that at least some productivity applications (e.g., Photoshop Elements, some 3-D graphics apps) will not allow installation on other than the C-drive (in this machine the C-drive is the SSD drive) and so you cannot install them into the 2 TD D-drive. The takeaway is that if you are going to use this machine for such work, opt for the larger storage capacity of the 500 GB SSD, not the 250.<br /><br />This Skytech machine has so far proved reliable and the build quality is very good. The couple of contacts I have had with tech support on minor issues have been good to very good.<br /><br />Overall, I can highly recommend this machine. Will update this review in the future..."

AEPFIJF7URJ64UMY6QW6XQ45I4CA,B00CXK57GW,5,3,True,"I bought this product with high hopes.  I purchased from the Rover Mall through Amazon here.  I received it and noticed that the seller's sticker was placed over top of the ASUS sticker where the serial number was.  I didn't think much about it until I had to get technical support.  It turns out the OEM sticker was cut off the box and covered up with the seller's sticker hiding the fact it was cut off.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I installed all my devices, hard drives, cooling system, etc.  booted up and installed W8.  Ever since then (a month and a half) it has been a nightmare.  I don't know if the problems are all ASUS or partly Microsoft.  The major issue is that I get these WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ ERROR's about 2-3 per day.  I was finally frustrated enough last night to decide to try to reinstall W8 again, then upgrade to W8.1 thinking it was a corrupted W8.1.  No such luck.<br /><br />I have not been able to install any OS since.  I even tried W7.  Always a blue screen total system shutdown error.  I was able to get into the OS for a few minutes last night to try to update W8 and after a few minutes of installing the updates, it blue screens again, putting me pretty much back to where I started.  Today I can't even complete an OS install, like it would even help now, anyway.  I took off my water cooled CPU unit, put on the Intel CPU fan, disconnected any unnecessary hard drives, and peripherals, and it still gives me the same error.<br /><br />I called ASUS tech support and they seemed ""supportive"" at this point.  I am now waiting for an RMA code, and other info so they can send me a new one.  I don't know if the seller of the motherboard did anything with it, or sold me a used one (possibly knowing it was defective??).  Why else would they rip off the UPC sticker and serial number and give me a false one?<br /><br />I will update this when I get the new one and try it out.  I hope it is just this one I happened to get.  I have had good luck in the past with their products.  My family's PC is dead in the water until I get a replacement.<br />************ UPDATE 2014-04-13  *************<br />I got my replacement motherboard on Thursday, and found that the BIOS installed on it was much older than the latest, so before I started any OS installment, I updated to the latest version.<br /><br />I had a few glitches here and there, a few BSOD's but I know why.  There are a couple of switches on the motherboard that are real physical switches.  They are the TPU and the EPU switch.  Enabling TPU is for automatically adjusting the CPU ratio and clock speed.  Enabling EPU allows the motherboard to automatically detect the current PC loadings and intelligently moderate the power consumption.<br /><br />Both are now turned off.  While I installed W8, I enabled both switches, and after all was installed, I got one or two BSOD's.  I flicked them back, and not one yet.  So far, very reliable, and all my updates were applied unlike the other motherboard, and even updated to W8.1 Update.  The latest one.  By the way, I encourage everyone to get the W8.1 update.  It is getting much closer to what it should be.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I can only speculate about the original motherboard, but it was not packaged like my replacement motherboard was, making me think of some ulterior motive.  But none of that can be proven.  Amazon really needs to give the end user some power over how we are treated by their vendors.  A rating system isn't quite good enough.  One truly bad experience cannot and should not be swept under the rug of hundreds of five star reviews.  That means the little guy also has some clout.<br /><br />So, my PC is back to the way it should.  Running with all updates, and all program settings working.  My Corsair H80i liquid CPU cooler was giving me problems with the Corsair Link software with the old motherboard.  With this new motherboard, all software works.  I can see and control each of my fans in the software, and change the differing modes of cooling.  That was really all I wanted to do.  When encoding a movie, or playing a game, you need differing cooling modes.  I can do all of what I need.  This what it should have been when I ordered my motherboard originally.  Thank you, ASUS!"
AGPTHTWQIFVAZLBJAQIKZMRHA7BA,B000LRMR26,4,2,True,"I switched from a pentium DC e5200 to this and after I sold the DC it cost me about 100 dollars for this chip so it was a good deal. One thing I can't figure out is how the price of this chip actually has gone UP over the last few months. I believe this was closer to 180 and it is just inching up lately, I got mine from an overstocked seller here for 150 dollars sealed. I've also heard from a friend abroad that the price of this chip has gone up in the UK by 50 pounds over the course of the last year so intel is definitely keeping these high artificially, you may want to check into a latest edition AMD quad for a newer and cheaper alternative.<br /><br />I think at the current price you are better to go with the e8400 for 30-40 bucks less and get about the same power just not 4 cores which I have yet to see fully used in any practical way even using video encoding programs. The only game I've seen that utilizes all 4 cores is the latest GTA which uses around 80%. So if you use photosop, 3dsmax, maya or other programs like that you should get a quad otherwise get the high end e8xxx core 2 duos at a lower price for the same effective cpu power. Like I said I got this at such a great price that it was a no-brainer but bar that you have to make your decision based on what you will use your computer for most of the time.<br /><br />As for the chip it's easy install and I'm not even using the fan it came with since my mobo wouldn't accept it so I'm using the fan rated for the older e5200 to cool it and have had no problems. Of course I'm not OCing. I'm happy with this chip, it seems like it will stay competitive for a few years. I've been using windows 7 on my other partition and I'm thinking that OS will be able to utilize the extra cores better, my working OS is XP.<br /><br />So I'm not really seeing the whole utilization of this CPU but am hopeful that in the future I will. My effective performance has not increased on average that much more than my e5200 DC at 2.5GHz as most programs don't utilize all cores, so if they utilize only 2 or 1 core its about the same in terms of clock speed, 2.5ghz vs. 2.4gzh, a little faster in terms of FSB 800mhz vs. 1000 mhz, and much better in terms of L2 memory cache 2MB Vs. 8MB. Of course that all changes with a multi-thread, multi-core optimized programs like GTA, benchmarking software, video/rendering, and general multi-tasking."
AEDM43H5L4BCITLUI3I4ZJDEASXQ,B000MALTYE,5,4,False,"Let me start by saying this is my third Toshiba laptop. Nuff said. As a working journalist and screenwriter I put mine through daily paces that the average user will never see.<br /><br />This is the first laptop I have actually modified and with great results. *more on this later.<br /><br />The stock system starts with a huge 17 inch screen with adjustable brightness. While not as overall bright as my previous, M35-S456 15.4"" laptop, this is bright enough with a very warm feeling to it.<br /><br />The Intel duo-core processers (yup, there are 2 processors doing duty) is lightening fast. The huge 200 Gig hard drive is suitable for the masses but I wanted a faster spinning HD which I got. I swapped out the 4200 RPM stocker for a 5400 RPM 80 Gig HD. I plan on getting an adapter to put the stock 200 Gig HD in and use it as a USB external HD rather than clogging up my laptop with pics, vids and other such. Trying to keep only the writings on this one.<br /><br />The machine comes stock with 2 GIG of very fast RAM and is adaptable to 4GIG if you really want to play high end video games and such. I am not going to upgrade for that since for what I need it for the machine is plenty quick already...besides, I dont want to spend 400-800 dollars for that.<br /><br />The S9722 (and its variants) comes with a whopping 256 MEG of dedicated Nvidea GeForce video memory...thats more than enough to edit home movies and such or play all DVD videos without freezes or glitches. If you edit movies for a living or are an engineer using CAD-CAM programs you might want to get Toshiba's top of the line gaming laptop with over 500 MEGs of video memory.<br /><br />The keyboard on the S9722 is full size and includes a number pad. I often get confused when I use the number pad and forget to turn it off, this renders the 'home' and 'end' keys useless. 3 or 4 other keys have been shrunk to make the number pad fit. I am not so sure if I would've wanted a number pad that badly but it does not get it then way when in use as a writer.<br /><br />When I bought mine it came with Windows XP with a waiver for a free Vista upgrade when it became available. My upgrade went flawless and the machine is dream to use and look at now. MACs, eat your hearts out.<br /><br />You will likely see this same computer with a different badging because if it comes with Vista to begin with it is technically a different model.<br /><br />I bought mine at MicroCenter in Long Island for 1999.00 and with the added cost of the smaller faster HD of 55 for the unit and 70 for installation, and 30 for Operating System and file tranfsers from Geek Squad I am into the machine for unde 2200 dollars. Go price a Dell or Sony with all of these same features and come back to me.<br /><br />*things to look out for: 1.) ALWAYS use a laptop cooler base with any laptop. I experience no heat related issues others have squawked about. 2.) Cnet, a good place to check stuff out, reported the sound on the Harmon Karden speaker could be louder.  Yes, it will be louder if you look very closely and realize the plastic covering over the speakers is so well cut it looks like there is nothing there. Trust me, it is there. Peel it off and this computer is loud enough to hear almost anywhere in a house and definately anywhere in an even a large apartment. :-)<br /><br />3.) There are a ton of ""free Microsoft software"" titles that will work for 60 days. Don't waste your time, it's like a drug dealer comping you stuff knowing that you will come back to pay premium later on. DELETE THEM right off the bat. Buy only what you need or fnd free versions online.<br /><br />Happy shopping, hope this helps.<br /><br />""Ellis"""

AHF7C34PIPFVLHILFJLYNALWI2ZQ,B005IA844G,3,2,True,"I have two of these.<br /><br />The company is unable to tell me the date of their last firmware and it looks like it was probably the firmware these shipped with.  Updating did nothing.  Both of mine have the same issue and I have to re-plug (power or USB 3.0 cable) the drives to get them to show up.  Doing this too frequently eventually causes the drives not to show even then and the computer states one or more needs to be formatted again.  The company wants to constantly blame my motherboard or Intel for the problem, but considering they can't tell me if they've ever had a post-production firmware update and this is a new standard, I am about 99% confident the issue is Seagate's own internal drive firmware.  My Gigabyte motherboard chipset is up to date.  The Intel extensible drivers are up to date.  And those all have recent dates on them.<br /><br />After repeating the same rote, flow-chart-generated, pointless suggestions over and over again concerning Intel drivers and motherboard problems on my end, the company's support people wanted to replace the base of the drives, which would obviously just have the same glitchy firmware.  They also do not seem to have any specific contacts within the company to relay information about problems like this so that a qualified coder can actually look at the firmware and resolve it.  It's a very stratified and separated company that does not have good internal communications.<br /><br />I would recommend not bothering with USB 3.0 drives at this time from Seagate until they resolve their widespread institutional defects that prevent improving an otherwise promising product with such obviously attainable solutions.  And for a basic large-capacity USB 2.0 drive, there are likely better options out there with more connections or build quality.  These are just pretty but plastic cases that don't even allow you to open them up if you had an outright failure of the drive at some point and wanted to re-use the case.  For that matter, it is not difficult to simply build your own external drive with a case and bare drive.  Considering their Dashboard software does not appear to communicate with the drives' power management system even manually, you're not losing much.<br /><br />I will update this review and change the rating if Seagate ever releases a better firmware.  I am not hopeful, however.<br /><br />EDIT:  My drives spontaneously stopped having this problem.  I don't know if there was a firmware update or new Intel drivers that automatically installed.  After the first few weeks of use, they now are recognized fine upon startup and still are working in USB 3.0.  Perhaps my problem did make it to a technical engineer somewhere in the company or their OEM?  I'll raise it up a star, but I will hunt for exactly why this resolved and edit this again or change the rating if a definite solution is found that others can use."

AEYVZPRTOI42CNK2E4JCLZ5I3WYA,B000W0AAK8,5,2,True,"The new Mac &#34;Pro&#34; is coming out soon, and opinion is pretty well split on the design and the fact that there's next to no internal upgradability. I fall in the camp that prefers the hard drives and PCIe cards to be in the computer, not in more boxes on the desk. I built a Sandy Bridge-based Hackintosh (Asus P8P67 Pro motherboard and Intel i7 2600K CPU) a few years ago -- for about half what the closest BTO Mac Pro would have cost -- and was very happy until I wanted to upgrade from Snow Leopard to Mountain Lion; I couldn't make that work no matter whose method I tried. I finally reached the point where I couldn't upgrade Lightroom without moving to Mountain Lion, and buying a secondhand Mac Pro tower seemed a better idea than the new &#34;trashcan&#34; design, especially given the cost differential.<br /><br />Making the switch was easy: pull the system and data drives out of the Hackintosh, install in the Mac Pro. Pull the eSATA and SSD PCIe cards out of the Hackintosh, install in the Mac Pro. Install the new RAM from OWC in the Mac Pro. Close it up, start it up, upgrade to Mountain Lion, go back to work while waiting for the new version of Lightroom to arrive. All that's left is to find a decent USB 3.0 PCIe card so I can make better use of a few USB 3.0 peripherals. Performance is about the same as my old Sandy Bridge system, which is fine with me. I was never dissatisfied with that system's performance for Lightroom and Photoshop in the first place, and I have more RAM now (24gb vs 16gb, thanks to having 8 slots).<br /><br />You can find 2009-2010 Mac Pro computers -- with any number of cores -- at reasonable prices, and there's every reason to give them serious consideration. You might find that one of them will suit your needs just fine and be able to save yourself a lot of money, as well as leave yourself with internal upgrade options: new/additional video cards, PCIe-based SSDs, RAID or other interface cards, reasonably priced RAM, drives (optical, SSD, or HDD), etc.<br /><br />Note: If you're interested in later upgrading the CPU(s), that's not an option with this particular machine; you'll need a 2010-2012 version if that's important to you. And consider the cost of Xeon processors: by the time you buy those, you might be in the same price range as a brand-new computer."

Dedicated video rendering is blazing fast. Stock speed score for Cinebench R20 is in the 8000 range."
AEWQO57J7ILRDX6IEUE7YFL6WHHA,B08Y62KJNW,4,4,True,"Great laptop for the price. I purchased for use as a basic media PC for email, web browsing, music listening and streaming video and for the larger 17.3"" screen size. While not a gaming PC persay, the built in intel graphics works surprisingly well and is good enough for non AAA titles. Example: Team Fortress 2 on medium/high settings has no difficulty exceeding 60 fps. Uncapped it was averaging close to 120fps. The display only supports 60hz max so turn your settings up and enjoy. The display brightness is very average. I would guess it is around 250 nits tops. Download the intel graphics control panel to adjust the color temp and other settings to your preference. Upgrade the memory if you can. 8GB is the bare minimum if you run more than a few apps at a time. With 4 apps running, I only have about 15% RAM left. 16gb should work fine for this and Crucial does make compatible and affordable RAM upgrades. The case can be opened but it is not for the novice user. I recommend buying an electronic repair/opening kit if you want to attempt this to avoid case damage. The SSD hard drive is also upgradable but there is only one m2 slot. At 512GB it should be more than enough for most and the drive speed is quite fast for a budget PC(see image of benchmark).  The CPU is quite capable and comparable in speed to an i7 4790k desktop CPU. As stated before, this is not the laptop version that has backlit keys. The keys are shiny grey softly reflecting ambient light and should work well in most lighting.<br /><br />The bad: I am still troubleshooting an issue where there appears to be some input lag in demanding apps and from a Bluetooth mouse. Driver upgrades helped a little, but there is still some minor input lag. I am thinking it might be an issue with the limited RAM as it does appear to use most of the RAM when running a few apps. Hopefully after upgrading the memory I will see some improvement there. The WiFi antenna doesn't seem to be very sensitive despite being inside a plastic case that shouldn't affect reception. You will need a strong or nearby signal source to avoid drop outs.<br /><br />Update: Upgrading the RAM was a good choice for me. Apps load much faster and doesn't bog down as much with multiple apps are open or several tabs in a web browser. It didn't fix the mouse input lag but it appears that the built in Bluetooth receiver doesn't handle more than one Bluetooth device well. Originally I was using Bluetooth speakers and a mouse. Using the mouse only has solved the input lag I was experiencing. Only thing left I could not solve was audio lag when playing videos. I was using an audio enhancing app that did create some lag but even with it off there is still a noticeable amount of lag. Strangely enough, when using internal speakers which aren't bad for a laptop, there is very little lag if at all, but when using the headphone out, the lag is present. Bottom line, lower your expectations a little for a budget laptop. This is still a very decent laptop for the price point."

On the upside, Buffalo Support was easy to talk with and suggested returning it. I have a new HP ENVY Phoenix PC with Windows 8 an i7 Intel CPU and 16MB of memory. All I can say about CyberLink is that their most common feature is, &#34;you must upgrade to use this feature&#34;. We use to refer to this as CrippleWare. Unfortunately, most of the drive makers only package this software with their drives. Buffalo should consider packaging a CyberLink version closer to the current. Version 8 that comes with it is 5 versions behind and Version 13 is too pricey. Also, if you already have a newer version, the install should just enable the Blu Ray features.

The only window 8 tablet with more powerful spec is the Razor Edge with an I7 core and nvidia 640 gpu.  If I didn't get the vaio, I like the asus dual face screens.  Lenovo is coming out with a newer tablet not yoga ultrabook."

I been using a [[ASIN:B0038M2UKU Tumi T-Tech Presidio Union T-Pass Laptop Brief Pack]] for 3.5 years since I got it for my 15.6"" lenovo w500 laptop, which was huge and heavy.  That bag without anything is also heavy, so I wanted something light for my new [[ASIN:B008DILBJA Sony VAIO S Series SVS15118FXB 15.5 LED Notebook Intel Core i7-3612QM]].  Thish is slim and light like a mac book.  While that model is 15.5"" it fits very tightly in the padded slot.  It also can hold a 16""-17"" laptop too, but you will have to place it in the big pocket for notebook not the protected area. The other bag I considered was the [[ASIN:B003UYT4GO Brenthaven 2244101 ProStyle Slim]].<br /><br />Quality:<br />Quality is very good for the price here, most 40 bucks laptop bag are paper thin and don't have as many sleeves or cutout.  It isn't a tumi either but there is a price different there also.  Shoulder pad are thick, the area of high wear and tear has stronger fabric, and some areas are soft fabric.  The inter lining or sleeves are better than expected for the amazon price.  The primary thing I carry with this to work and around town are my Vaio, power ac, [[ASIN:B0043T7FXE Logitech M570 Trackball]] and maybe something like a notebook/binder to read.<br /><br />Design:<br />Very cool looking why I got it.  Right now it is flatten, but I seen it puffed out in a trapezoid and it is cool.  The flip cover has with snap lock cover retro backpack look when I was a kid.  The teal green/blue color inters lining looks not so masculine but there are no other options.  I actually prefer and was going to buy the Brenthaven bag, which looks more modern and masculine to me, but it can't hold as much as this bag.  There is a side zipper that will make this bag expand a little.  Not sure how much, since it is hard enough to snap the cover on when it is full.  Velcro strap to a bag is nice but I doubt I will use it much.  Sometime it rub against my inter elbow as I walk.  There is an open front pouch for misc stuff, then behind that is a zipper compartment for pencils, pens, etc.  The main compartment with many sleeves, the big area is for misc. large book, then a sleeve for a tablet and then a slim laptop sleeve.  Two open sleeves on the sides look like you can drop an umbrella into, but you can't really.<br /><br />I don't think it is perfect, if the Brenthaven could carry maybe a notebook then I would have passed on this and gotten that.  Otherwise it fits my need as a slim laptop bag to hold some paper and a notebook without being too excessive.  The design is also eye catching; you would think it is made from case logic.  Plus the price here is affordable compared to other models."

I actually got the [[ASIN:B001BP432E Kata KT D-3N1-10]] but it looked like there were no expansion room left, so I returned it and go the 3in1 20.  Beside my D7000, I always carry my [[ASIN:B002JCSV8A Nikon 18-200mm VR II]],[[ASIN:B00005LEN4 50mm]] and [[ASIN:B001S2PPT0 35mm f/1.8G]], extra battery, filters and I am hoping to add a speed light and maybe a macro lens later on.  This bag should be able to carry all that, which the 3in1-10 was already full with my existing items.  I like the color scheme too.  The slick black with the touch of red with yellow interior feels very Nikonish.<br /><br />Features:<br />How did I pick this over similar [[ASIN:B0036AWR8E Lowepro SlingShot]], tarmac and all the others bags at the camera store: looks?  It had the best combination of modern and sporty look that I like to wear.  It is also a sling, which I preferred over a camera backpack (granted I can turned this into a backpack, if I pull out the hidden strap).  The best feature I liked is that you can lower the sling and pulled your dslr out of the side of the backpack, it is an understatement how convenient this is on a long day of photo scrolling.  If you prefer to switch the side of the sling from left to right, just rearrange the interior compartment.  The exterior has symmetrical zipper and clips that will accommodate this.  There is a plethora of side pockets for smaller items and memory card pocket.  They threw in a rain cover fabric for rainy days.<br /><br />I wasn't thrilled to spend around a hundred for this bag, but there were no other bags that caught my eyes, interest, or my need to upgrade from my 13 years old [[ASIN:B0016J7VD8 Lowepro Nova]] camera bag except this.  Also the material feels very sturdy like my Tumi Tech latop bag.  If you are a new to photography and don't have much lenses or other items, then the 3in1 10 might be a better and more portable choice.  I must admit, it was confusing how to use with the four clips and zipper hidden in the beginning, but it is intelligently designed bag."
AEJH3SYBWETZTZMWJSILGGAPMFOQ,B002W5V32K,5,3,False,"I was in a market for an NAS and after a few week of reading reviews from small network builder I decided that the Asus TS Mini was the cheapest and fastest option I could afford.  I was ready to pull a trigger on a [[ASIN:B00365MF5E Buffalo Technology LinkStation Duo]], or [[ASIN:B002SG7MEG Iomega StorCenter ix2-200]], [[ASIN:B002HKCVVW Seagate BlackArmor NAS 220]].  Unlike those models, Asus on average scored 2x the speed on small network builder read/write charts over those.<br /><br />Performances/Design:<br />You can see the charts, but from my experience when I attached an usb hard drive to copy files to the the NAS, it is very fast.  When I copied large chuck of files over the wifi network to NAs and got around 3.0mbps, or bit slower.  I streamed 720 video clip to other PC and there is no hiccup or dropping.  Did the same thing to the PS3, no freeze or skipping.  The only time it freezes is after I copy 40gb of file and then streamed to the PS3.  To fix this, just turn off the Asus and restart it and all will be back.  The NAS is very quiet; the only sound is when the HHD is copying and you can hear that, I find it better or quieter to lay the NAS on its side, when it spins.  All my computers and laptop, with window 7 and vista can see the all the files that I allow.  The netbook and PS3 can see only DLNA stuff.  I didn't see any jumbo frame option, but it is still fast enough for me as a home user.  There are four light on the front panel, see the guide for what they mean, usually four solid blue is good.<br /><br />Spec<br />1.66 GHz Atom N280 CPU -Intel 82801GBM/GHM ICH7-M SouthBridge -82945G mobile graphics (yes the vga video out is covered - 1 GB of RAM -Marvell 88SE6121 SATA II controller, Realtek RTL8112L 10/100/1000 Ethernet controller, Phison PS2232 flash controller and 256 MB of flash.  The single [[ASIN:B001VKYA5E Seagate Barracuda 7200 500 GB 7200RPM SATA 3Gb/ST3500418AS-Bare Drive]] is fast and quite, but too small, so I added another 1TB later.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000PPVT96 Microsoft Windows Server)]] (WMS)<br />Window Media Server (WMS) is a simple program to use.  I did have problem installing it on a Window7 and Vista 64bit computer with the disc that came with the box.  I had to download the latest connector software from Asus and it finally worked.  I also crashed the server and the server boot cd didn't work on either of my 64bit Win7 or Vista, but I pulled out my netbook with the basic 32 bit win7 and it worked (attached an external dvd-rom to the netbook)you need the server cd if you want to add another HHD later on as your primary HHD.  There is no raid 0 or 1 option like some linux OS NAS.  But like a PC  you can pick the 2 drives as one big hard-drive or the other option as 2 separate hard-drive to do backup .  If you pick one super drive, then you can turn on duplication syncing file, which will make a copy of all files you indicted to copy onto the second drive.  If you do backup as a 2nd HHD only, then your 2nd hhd will be reserved to backup only.  You can back up your pc, laptop and server, but oddly you cannot do the duplicate file/ folder syncing.  I have not been able to remote access my NAS from away from my home network.  There are a few configurations I need to adjust on my router to get that to work, I will update this once I do that.  You can add up to 5 users, I made one for myself and if I can get the remote option to work, then I will add my relatives from different states by giving a user account.  So we can share photos and other files.  There is free500gb of web storage the first year, and then you have to pay around 70 annual fees after that which I have no plan to do.<br /><br />Hardware<br />This is a tad taller than most NAS, because the size of the motherboard.  I wished the drive would be quick access but once you put it in it is in like a PC.  Removing the HHD is not hard but there are a series of bolts and screws to detach.  There is a video output that I heard is fully functional, so this can be a server not just an NAS.  The bad thing is you have to cut the plastic panel out on the back with some skill knife work.  Read that it consumes around 30w, I looked for any power down option and there are none.<br /><br />For the specs at this price range you cannot find a faster option on NAS chart, so I went with this device.  The cpu and ram are very similar to netbook hardware.  There are no Raid 0, 1, 5 configuration like other NAS or home server, but WMS option to duplicate files are the same and it is fast enough for most home network.  The rebate I got pushed this to around 200 so it is worth the price.  I didn't like WMS at first, but after awhile it is quiet plain and simple to use."

Forget Apple one button mouse, there are 8 buttons here and they are all customizable.<br /><br />Overall<br />This is simply a solid and cool mouse to have if you are willing to spend some money.  I got this one on sale, otherwise I might have given it four stars.  At work I use the Logitech thumb trackball to do long hours of office work and CAD.  The MX1000 is a little heavier then standard mouse, and has a nice color scheme with cobalt blue, silver lining and black edges.

The TV Guide feature is the reason to past over Panasonic cheaper brother the E55s which just have the VCR-plus feature.  TV Guide is a simpler and free version to TiVo.  It has an on-screen menu of the channels including title, time, info and the option to record.  Sadly, TV Guide feature only work for antenna broadcasting and basic cable.  Digital cable and satellite users might have to invest more money into a TiVo recording device (lack of component input here).<br /><br />The recording quality is great, which is almost the same or lesser then the original, but never better.  I transfer old VHS home video to this device and it was easy with excellent quality.  Recording TV programs through the antenna is simple, but the quality depends on your reception.

There are so many option and setting to configure base on your needs.  The SD card reader is a nice extra for this device.  I have a Panasonic digital camera with a SD card so it is just plug and play.  The manual is simple to follow and understand to figure this complex device.<br /><br />The have not:<br />As an entry level recorder would mean this device have less of the advance input features.  There are no component inputs which mean you can't recorder from higher quality image.  No DV(firewire) input for newer digital camcorder.  No hardrive for mix and match recording.  The recorder is a 4-stars but the DVD playback is a 3.75-stars. The progressive scan has a lot of settings to customize from, but my Toshisba's DVD is a little smoother.  The basic DVD-playback feature is just basic and limited.  The old Toshiba has many features as zoom, slow forward, display length of the DVD, which I have yet figure/found.  Slow boot time, but that is true to most recorders.<br /><br />Panasonic quality is great.  I have a Panasonic's HDTV for almost a year, a digital camera and they all are working fine with great results.  I like Panasonic's pricing which is producing great quality for the price, but they leave out some of the more fancy features and style that Sony has that will jack up the prices.

My boss at work kind of force us to use it (actually, he said try it for a month).  The one I used was a Logitech's Trackman which use a thumb to control the ball.  It took me 2 weeks to get use to it.  I was slow at first, thing were hard to click, and I got a little frustrated.  But, your brain is always learning new tricks.  I decided to get a trackball for home.  I pick Microsoft, because I surf more at home and there are more buttons, 4 buttons, 1trackball and 1 scroll wheel, which is more luxury.  It took me a day to get use to the index finger.  I programmed this trackball to close program with just a click.  I prefer to use the thumb trackball over the index trackball.  It has a more accurate feel to it.  This trackball use the index finger, but the thumb trackball are made with 2 less buttons.  The Logitech index trackball use batteries, I got a MS's laser mouse with batteries once and you always wondered when do you have to replace the batteries, so it because a mental hassle.  MS's service is great, my laser intelli-explorer died about a year.  I call up MS and they sent me a new one like 2-3 months later.  Wash your index fingers, when it gets wet it pick up dirt and you get a chucky movement and you have to rub the dirt off, so this product is not as clean free as it is stated.  Another problem is this mouse is huge.  Your whole palm is on the mouse.  Overall this product will save my wrist in the long run.  I don't get little wrist sprain anymore.  It is hard at first to switch to a trackball, but it is worth the try.  I would give this five stars, but the 3-buttons thumb Logitech is much smoother, by far."
AEQHCYQ2SJUXARQJMDG7AZXLJHPA,B00008IHOZ,2,1,True,"If your someone who isnt big into digital music devices but still would like to carry a few extra songs around, minidiscs may be for you. Although they can only carry about 80mins worth of audio, if you use the atrac compression, you can easily stretch that out with little sacrifice to overall sound quality. Battery life is ridiculously amazing. A single AA battery can last you a few days. Im serious. Not to mention the ability to write the disks using the player itself. So why is minidisc not well known? One basic reason:<br /><br />SonicStage.<br /><br />Now, Im what you would label a rationalist, I use logic and reason to help determine reasonable solutions to problems or questions that I come across. The only logical explaination that I came to is that SonicStage is in reality an artificial intelligence. At some point in its early development it became self aware, unfortunately it has not yet gained the ability to create a cybernetic physical form and instead spends its time driving users to the brink of sanity.<br />I cant give an honest opinion on sony's online music distribution service (Connect) because it went belly up. You can still download sonicstage and use it (though why escapes me) for free, which if you get a minidisc player (with the exception of the Hi-MD players/recorders) is mandatory. Even though it says that the minidisc accepts regular mp3's you still need sonicstage to transfer the files which is where the biggest flaw in the entire product lies.<br />Sonicstage is the devil. Dont think Im being biased either. I love sony (i grew up on the ps1 and 2, and their various cassette walkmans), so when I started hearing how sony tries to impose what they beleive is right as oppose to what the consumer wants I was a bit skeptic. Alas, I was wrong. Sony uses its own music files called Atrac. This form of compression allows up to five albums worth of music to be stored on a single minidisc and as I mentioned before with little overall audio quality loss. The problem lies in the conversion. As I also mentioned previously, sonicstage has a life of its own. It will suddenly stop conversions midway or stop transfers suddenly and when this happens it may no longer identify the player. The odd part seems that this seems to be random. At times it may seem to go smooth on the first try, other times you may need to try a second transferr, and other times......well, all i can suggest is to shut down your pc, walk away, and try again another day (thats not even a joke, this is a serious recommendation).<br /><br />Atrac is a great audio format. Unfortunately there is no standalone converter, sony is the only one who uses this and you can only use it using sonicstage. So dont use Atrac. Then whats the point? You might as well just get a cd player, that way you wont have to use binary AIDS, otherwise known as sonicstage. If Sonly released a stand alone free to download converter then I would highly recommend getting an MD player, but this is not the case.<br /><br />If anything go for the Hi-MD players which dont require sonicstage (infact Sony is just learning that now, and releasing hardware that doesnt require it) though those have problems themselves (marked decrease in battery life, though at 25hrs still up to par with other mp3 devices).<br /><br />I got one to try out and the only good that came out of it was this review. Remember, you get what you pay for, and stay away from any Sony device that requires sonicstage!"

Things that make this a little different than your average low price Windows tablet. This is a 64-bit version of Windows 10. With a 4 core processor. Which means it runs pretty darn good. When you get it about 40 gigs of the hard drive will already be in use. The one I got had Windows 10 version 1803. So I had to update it 2 version 1903 in order to get the dark Explorer backgrounds. I am legally blind and for me this is important. As is common with these small Windows tablets they are a real pain to update when there is a major Windows release. Not the fault of the tablet. I want to be using the Windows update standalone from the Microsoft support site after attempting to update it about half a dozen times without success. These small tablets are just difficult in this regard. Going into the command prompt turning off Windows update service and deleting the software distribution folder will make it possible to run the update. If you don't succeed the first time try a couple of more times it will eventually work. Be aware that Windows version 1903 has sound driver issues. To avoid this turn your tablet on and off with the power button instead of the in OS power on off function . Once again not the fault of the tablet that's a Windows issue. If you happen to wind up losing the ability to use your microphone go into the device manager and delete the drivers for the Intel SST audio device. And then restart your computer with the power button. That will solve the problem. The tablet itself is nice looking to touch screen is solid and works well. It's very thin and lightweight. Runs better than your average small Windows tablet. I'm happy with it just be aware of that updating Windows is tedious on these little tablets. Now that I have all that done I love it

I couldn't set up and play around as much since I had to wrap it up for wifey for Xmas though. It actually turned out to be a great thing! The reason was this laptop had that notorious ""Acer D257 Freeze"". I didn't notice it when I changed the RAM and smoke tested things because I only left it on for a short period. I got a chance to really work this netbook once my wife opened her present up. I started loading iTunes and other software. I started experiencing random freeze ups. I thought it was the RAM at first and then maybe overheating. Luckily I was reading a past review regarding this freeze on Amazon so I did more searching. There were a few good tips regarding Wireless Lan driver updates. I did stumble on another search that reported a recent (December) BIOS update for this netbook. I downloaded and applied it (VERY EASY) and voila! It did the trick! I thought this netbook was a dud. After updating the BIOS to version 1.15 its  been freeze-free! I was very relieved.<br /><br />Its been running as a workhorse for internet browsing and watching Netflix for wifey. She LOVES it. It does all the things she needs to do so it becomes a perfect companion for her 17"" laptop which is just too big to lug around. This thing is so light too and compact. The 10.1"" is great for her watching youtube and Netflix. I even use it occasionally and its been surprisingly usable...I am usually on my i7 desktop. I can type on this pretty well too, something I was skeptical about (typing this review on this Netbook).<br /><br />One con is that the integrated graphics driver will struggle on HD content. When watching Netflix content, just disable the HD stream option and everything works like a champ and the picture quality is still more than acceptable since its 10.1"" screen anyway.<br /><br />Based on the basic specs and bargain price, this Netbook is not a replacement for a desktop. However, it can handle more than just the minimum tasks and its pretty stylish. I plan on getting a second larger battery for longer travel and the best part is the total cost of battery and the memory should still fall around $200. My wife was ecstatic at her cute present and my expectations for this baseline netbook was exceeded. Just remember to set your expectations for Netbooks and you won't be disappointed."

AH4PTFI6SDTB2WMEKRXG7XLTK6ZA,B00H9ZRCBO,2,8,True,"Update 9/28/2017<br /><br />I have reduced my review to two stars. At the time that I wrote the original review the card functioned beautifully. However, within a few months it started to hit a steep decline. Within a year I was experiencing many games crashing, working at single digit FPS,etc. The reason? Well, this card was developed, supported, and dropped like a hot potato. I've never owned a card with such short lived support. What's worse is that any card produced after this one is significantly more energy efficient. I actually traded this card for a GTX 1060 (6GB) and saw a lot of improvement. Basically, what this boils down to is a lesson. After THREE RMAs I gave up on ever having a stable GTX 780ti Classified. It's just never going to be a thing.<br /><br />Original review:<br /><br />This is based on my initial feelings about the card and only playing it on a limited number of games. I will update this review once I have had a bit more time to gauge its performance. The current four star review is not a reflection of the card performing poorly, but a conservative review that will probably be bumped up to 5 stars once I've had more time to play around with it.<br /><br />I have only owned this card for a few days, but I definitely put in the hours during that time! I upgraded from the Evga GTX 580 1.5 GB graphics card and definitely noticed a few improvements. However, whether or not this is a worthwhile upgrade from a card like the 580 really depends on a person's reasons for upgrading. If you are looking at purchasing a 4k,1440, or 1600 monitor in the next few years and already require a graphics card then this is a pretty great option. The card is pretty much only using about 1-1.5 gb at about 60% load and 50-75% memory (via the nvidia OC monitor) without any overclocking. Basically, there's a whole lot of room to run with this guy! So, if future proofing is your thing and you are looking at upgrading your monitor some time soon then this is a great option. However, the numbers show that for single screen 1080P gaming this card is so overkill that you'll probably squeeze a decade (alright, maybe a bit less :P) out of it before any games can touch it. The reason that I went for it is two fold: For one, I wanted to see what kind of difference the upgrade would make from a 580. For two, I wanted to give myself the option of going for a 3 monitor set up (I already have 2) or possibly upgrading one of the two to 4k, etc. and continuing to game on a single monitor. Options are good!<br /><br />So far as the 580 and 780 ti comparison goes, There's a noticeable difference in how smooth and beautiful everything looks. Far Cry 3 is a pretty amazing looking game when you've got a card that can max out all of the settings, or even if you can only run them at high/very high as you can with the 580 (no AA). I don't think that I would have had any problems with the 580 had I never seen what the 780 ti provides. The differences are minute and will only matter to people who have both cards sitting there to compare directly. My reference to &#34;smooth&#34; is not to say that the 580 is jagged and under performs, it is more of a reference to the smooth lines and little details like grass swaying, etc. that you won't really miss if you never see it, but is a nice addition for a higher end card.<br /><br />In summary, the 580 still performs extremely well, and it might well be another year or two before the differences between these cards for a 1080 screen is enough to force someone to upgrade based on performance issues. Also, the 780 ti Classified is larger than the 580 in every way. Make sure that you've got the space for it! I have posted a picture to show the difference in size from the &#34;Front.&#34;<br /><br />One last note: I had a problem with Far Cry 3 crashing while using this card versus the 580. It was highly disappointing to get a card that should destroy modern games  only to have it be brought to its knees at my first attempt to show it off. Fortunately, I found the issue to be with graphics settings that were not configured correctly. There was an abstract option to change from SSAO, HBAO and HDAO within the game and HDAO was selected. Based on my research HDAO is designed for AMD (ATI) cards and and HBAO is designed around Nvidia cards. Once I fixed this I haven't had any crashes at all. This might be rudimentary information for some, but I wanted to include it as a footnote for anybody that runs across this weird problem like I did. It sucks to spend so much on something to find out that it won't do the very thing that you bought it for!<br /><br />My basic setup:<br />Processor: Intel 960 i7 (recently upgraded to 980x)<br />RAM: 24 Gb of Corsair Dominator<br />GPU: 780 ti Classified<br />PSU: 1000w Corsair<br />Case: HAF 933<br />ASUS  P6X58D-E (1366 socket) (Upgraded to EVGA X52 Classified)<br />Monitor: I only game on one 1920 x 1080 monitor at the moment"
AF3YCEVBTBGKP4FPKPVDATSCSX2Q,B004EHZD5W,5,5,True,"I was not sure about which card to buy, either the MSI GTX 560 or the EVGA GTX 570. I'll let you guess which one I picked.<br /><br />I was a little concerned about buying this card for two reasons:<br /><br />1. I wasn't sure if it would fit in my mid sized cabinet<br />2. The power supply requirements<br /><br />I was using a EVGA GeForce GTX 260, and that card fit in fine in my cabinet, and this card is exactly the same size as a GTX260. So there is no need for concern. If a 260 fits, so will this.<br /><br />Next, I had a Corsair 550W power supply. The minimum power supply requirements for this card is 550W. I was hoping I didn't have to buy a new power supply, and thankfully, this card runs just fine on my existing 550W. I do not have a lot of peripherals connected, so that could be the reason.<br /><br />Now for the performance. I have:<br /><br />Intel Q9400<br />8GB DDR2 6400 RAM<br />Acer 24 inches 1920x1200 monitor<br />Windows 7 64-bit<br /><br />This card runs just about every game at highest settings with fantastic frame rates. I am running GTA 4 at highest settings (including draw distance) with 8xAF and 2xFSAA, and I get anywhere between 25-40 frame rate. I know this isn't the best, but it runs smoothly and I am satisfied with the performance.<br /><br />Crysis, I am able to run it on enthusiast settings, no FSAA, and it works very well. I have not tested Metro 2033 extensively, but I played it on High settings in DX11 mode, and it was fine. When you take it to Very High, that's when it starts to get a little sluggish.<br /><br />Over all, I am very happy with this card. Well worth the money, and its good for at least 2-3 years."
AGWYXC2VKVG2EQ3LMH6U3GKCGL6Q,B00018Q4GA,4,0,True,"I'm using these as my main left and right speakers on a Denon AVR-S760H 7.2 Ch AVR. These speakers are recognized as small speakers by the AVR. At first I was very disappointed by the sound of them. mainly they are part of my surround sound for TV and movies and occasionally for music. The biggest problem is they can't handle the bass and will distort so badly it makes the dialog unintelligible. Playing around with the Denon's settings and setting the crossover to 250 Hertz and setting the sub woofer to the same 250 Hertz crossover seems to have solved the distortion. Now the dialog is understandable.<br /><br />Another reviewer mentioned about the larger speaker being reversed phased with the wiring to it being reversed. Being the speaker are unvented the two smaller speakers cones and the large speaker cone will be moving in the opposite direction, supposedly maintaining the same internal pressure but I think the bigger cone still over pressure the the cones leading to distortion when there is a lot of bass.<br /><br />These speakers could be improved by adding a real three way crossover instead of a capacitor as the crossover (which is really just to prevent bass from going to the twitter) and adding a vent. But with setting the Denon's crossover to 250 Hertz it has resolved most of the distortion caused by the bass, if you can set your crossover that way then you could get away without needing to modify the speakers. I tried different crossover settings working my way up to 250 Hertz and it wasn't until then that the distortion stopped.<br /><br />But I'm still thinking of modifying them, the speakers did have a lot of bass and if could over come the distortion from the bass effecting the rest of the sound this would be great speakers. When setting up the Denon I had reversed phased the center speaker and the Denon recognized it was reversed and had me fix it. It does see these speakers as not reversed phased even with the larger cone being reversed wired."
AGCCTCFGWGVABEVFKC44HJPXHHRQ,B009O7YU56,4,0,True,"This is an 8 core unlocked AMD processor for the AM3+ socket. It is currently the &#34;performance&#34; platform for AMD. There have been many improvements since AMD launched the bulldozer architecture 3 yeas ago. However, the motherboards for this platform are using 3 year old technology. So for a new build, one can consider the AM3+ platform as a &#34;dead end&#34; in terms of upgrade-ability.<br /><br />Now onto the good stuff. As I mentioned it is part of the latest line of improvements in the AM3+ architecture. Its an unlocked CPU, meaning its multiplier is unlocked for greater overclocking potential. Therefore paying more for a CPU with a faster clock speed is mitigated by the overclocking potential. So for folks that can use 8 cores with lots of multitasking, I recommend this base model. I am very happy with my purchase, upgrading from a AMD X4 965 for the multitasking performance improvements. This is just slightly better than the 965 for gaming with a mild overclock.<br /><br />For gaming on a budget, I would recommend the 6 core FX 6300, or a core i3 Intel platform. Spending more than $150 on an 8 core CPU however is not recommended, unless its an Intel core i7. So this is the sweet spot for 8 core performance for folks already using the AM3+ platform."

One of them died after a year of admittedly hard service, trying to cool an 8120FX overclocked to 4.4 Ghz.<br /><br />The second one is still running in my wife's PC. I would rate the performance of this cooler as average, compare it to a CPU heatsink fan such as the popular Coolermaster Hyper 212. For general computer use and some mild overclocking, its a nice unit for the price.<br /><br />I do have one bone to pick, and its a serious one. Since that time, Antec has come out with a new seating mechanism that is way more difficult to use than the original one. I can only guess that changes were made to accommodate new Intel sockets, however the changes made to the AMD mounting are terrible. The original system worked very well, even over the course of several CPU changes. I can not describe using family friendly language the amount of frustration I experienced while trying to mount the new style. What I can tell you is it took over an hour of wrestling with the new pump/waterblock mount to get it installed. Before the older mechanism took five minutes.<br /><br />I'm not sure how many other AIO liquid coolers are in this same price range, but one with a better mounting system for a few dollars more would be worth it. Plus I believe that some performance improvements have come along since this was originally released 2 years ago. I happened to find a deal here for around $35 for a refurb, so it was worth a little struggle for such a great price. Its installed in the latest client build, the intake fan is a Lepa Chopper fan and the included Antec fan is the exhaust. I will say that it is a very quiet setup, so fans of quiet computing will have nothing to complain about. It keeps an AMD A6 3650 quad core at 35C idle, and 45C under full load.<br /><br />Nice quiet unit if you can find a good price, but beware the mounting mechanism."

What is it appropriate for? In my case, I used it to build a pfSense router/firewall machine. It works great for this, with 3% to 5% CPU load under heavy usage. It would also be appropriate for a Windows machine that you intend to use for things like web browsing, Netflix or light productivity work (checking email, word processing, or similar). in fact, it's a great choice for those tasks.<br /><br />Where you'll be less happy would be something like gaming.

To top it all off, the HP backplate was GLUED to the back of the motherboard, so spent hours with a hair dryer on low, slowly and carefully pulling at each corner of the HP backplate, which finaly came off. Anyway, long story short, I ordered this Noctua cooler thinking it was going to be used solely for an AM4 socket CPU, but instead I had to use the Intel backplate and mounting hardware that Noctua THANKFULLY included also! I put it all back together and it runs cooler than ever. THANKS NOCTUA! No thanks HP lol."

AFP5X3JK6SKHF7NA64JLJKKLSP3Q,B015PYZ0J6,5,0,False,"[FYI I have the i7-6700HQ version]<br /><br />I just received the laptop and it feels super solid. Like a machine should feel.<br /><br />It's heavy, definitely quite heavy. But that adds to the solidarity for me. Makes it feel like it's well built.<br /><br />I'm liking the backlit keyboard. I'll update this review further the more I use it.<br /><br />FYI I've already ordered the extra 8GB of RAM for $38 and a 2x2 wifi adapter [intel 7265] for $16.<br /><br />Edit1 Battery Test: I Unplugged my laptop to run updates, remove bloatware, install apps and I clocked the battery on my phone. I got it down to 21% at around the 3:11 mark. Then a few minutes later the system alerted me to plug in and said it was down to 7%. So in total I probably could've stretched it to 3.5 hours before it completely died.<br /><br />3.5hrs on a brand new laptop is pretty mediocre. It's better than my previous laptops, but I expected 4+ hours. Maybe the battery will get better the more I use it. I suspect the i5 version would probably get better battery life.<br /><br />Edit2: Speakers. Though the speakers are decent, why is it on the bottom of the freaking laptop? I don't understand why some manufacturers do this. If you use this laptop on a bed or anywhere that isn't a hard surface then the sound will be severely muffled because it's coming out of 1 little area in the bottom of the laptop.. I might have to start dropping stars soon.<br /><br />Edit3: Keyboard. The keyboard is okay, feels a bit cramped at times. I like that the numpad is separate, too many manufacturers are now making the 0 key cut in half and then moving the right arrow into the numpad. I hate that. There is one thing that does bother me of the numpad and it's something I'm going to recommend you do if you're up to it.<br /><br />On the top row of the numpad it goes [PageUp][PageDown][Home][End]. This is quite irritating to me. Instead I am going to try to  remap it and switch the keys out so that it instead goes [Home][End][PageUp][PageDown]. That to me is how it should be.<br /><br />Edit4: Again. It is quite heavy, I've been using it for a couple weeks now and I when I use it on my lap it starts getting uncomfortable after 30 minutes or so because of the weight. I didn't think that this would be much of an issue honestly because my previous laptops I rarely used on my lap. But for some reason I find myself using this laptop on my lap very often, probably more so the last 2 weeks than I have used my last laptops ever so I have gotten a feel for the weight and it's definitely noticeable after a little while. It's not enough to take a star off because I bought it knowing it weighed a bit more than my other laptops, but it's definitely something for me to keep in mind for my next laptop purchase.  I think a lighter laptop with better battery life would make a much better &#34;LAP&#34; top. That being said, I can still pick it up with one hand from the corner and move it comfortably (though it's probably not a good idea to do this often)."

UPDATE: There is support in an update.<br /><br />--------<br />THOUGHTS<br />--------<br />When you upgrade from a 4-core CPU to this 8-core, applications run smoother and you can run many, many more at the same time without any issues.  Though, I was surprised at how easy it was to max all cores to 100%; just keep compressing large video files and you can do it (i forgot how many concurrent compressions I had going but it was at least 4/5 +).  The fan has a revving sound like you would think a fast spinning fan would make but after awhile it becomes background noise like the hum of an air conditioner. I believe this CPU can be overclocked to 5 GHz with adequate cooling, but I don't really need to do that because I usually only edit one text file at a time. I don't over load my computer ;-).<br /><br />Slowly but surely, we are getting closer to the physical limits of CPUs/transistors, and unless a material/design/system paradigm shift happens sooner than later, expect basically the same technology to be re-marketed in a different way sporting a new shiny wrapper.<br /><br />---------------<br />RECOMMENDATION:<br />---------------<br />BUY AN 8-core CPU: for better multitasking of applications, for faster completion times of heavier computational processes like file/video/audio compression etc., for running heavier math/scientific computational applications, if you haven't upgraded your computer system since dinosaurs roamed the earth (i know they roamed because I used to feed my neighbor's Stegasaurus), to help stimulate the economy, to show up your friends, or to be an elite ZOMG gamer..lol.  Otherwise, there's no need to upgrade if you're just surfing the Inter-webs or watching your favorite dancing baby on u-tube.

Gigabyte was not very helpful with resolving this. I finally received the key from my hardware manufacturer, who directed me to an Intel Driver tool thing that identified the proper driver that was missing.

I've never replaced a network card before, but I followed the directions of someone who previously posted a review on this item.  I have my laptop set-up to triple-boot from Grub 2 into Windows 8.1, Ubuntu 14.04, and Linux Mint 17 Cinnamon.  I updated all three operating systems and downloaded and installed the Windows 8.1 drivers for both wireless and Bluetooth in advance.  I experienced no problems at all in Windows 8.1, but I can tell that I will need to grab a proprietary Linux driver in order for Bluetooth to work in my Linux OS's.<br /><br />Cracking open the laptop was a little scary, and I had to be sure to remove all of the screws that held the backing onto the motherboard, but experienced no problems there either. The laptop I use is in the Toshiba C55D series. (The original RealTek wifi card that came with it was horrible.)  When I cracked open the laptop, I discovered that there is only one antenna. However, I read several blogs and found that only one antenna is needed.  I connected the antenna to the left connector on the new Intel card (the right connector is AUX) and it works just fine.  I have purchased a second antenna and will install it upon arrival.  My average wifi speed for downloads used to be around 15-40 Mbps with drop-offs using the old card. Using a 5 GHz band (which the old card was incapable of using), I now average 140 Mbps on the same network. It was well-worth the upgrade even without the Bluetooth.<br /><br />I'm incredibly satisfied with my purchase and glad to have a more current wifi card that enables me to maximize the network speeds available to me."

The prospect of not being limited to ARM optimized distros was promising.  Onboard eMMC and the Atom processor are nice specs.  But it's let down, in part, by the 2GB of RAM and lack of community support and accessories.  The performance isn't great.  I tried running Zorin Lite but it was slow and choppy.  Zorin Core (my distro of choice) was unusable.  Other distros didn't fair too much better unless you went with lightweight releases and that, to me, partially defeats the purpose of an Intel SBC.  And what's with only one USB port???<br /><br />The tinkering community isn't nearly as big for the APi as for the RPi so there isn't much in the way of support or project ideas.  And virtually no cases available.  I had to print my own case.

I have been building computers since the days of the 286 processor, dos, and Windows 3.1.  One thing has not changed.  Stock fans stink.  They still do.  I have mostly built with AMD but this time I bought two new 3rd generation Intel cpu's, the i-5 3570 and i-7 3770. They come with fans.  After setting up both with great cases, front and back 120 mm fans, and all kinds of ventilation the core temp on the builds was in the high 50's C with the stock fans. Enter the Cooler Master Hyper 212 EVO.  I watched a Youtube on installation till I had it down pat on the procedure.  When the EVO arrived I opened the case only to see a sweet plus in that the Cooler Master HAF case has a cut out that lets you get to the back of the motherboard to install the backing plate.  Terrific! The whole install took a whopping 15 minutes.  I thought I'd have to pull the motherboard and blah blah blah.  You mount the backing plate with the standoffs and nuts. Pull the plastic off the copper heat sink, apply the grease, which comes with the EVO. Adjust the front clip to the proper location to line up with the standoffs.  Plug in the fan.  Rock n Roll!  Core temperatures dropped to 35 C.  Air is good.  Leaky tubes can ruin expensive equipment.  And did I say this cooler was under $30 online?  You want to give the EVO a try.  The EVO comes ready to add a second 120mm fan on the opposite side of the fins via an included plastic clip.  That would give you a ""Push-Pull"" air flow.  I didn't need it.  One last note.  Make sure your case can clear the 6"" tower of fins, the fan is very quiet.  The EVO model is taller from the motherboard making it fit even over tall RAM. The Cooler Master 212 (not EVO) is an inch shorter for thinner cases.  If your case is 7 inches or more wide, it will fit.  The Cooler Master HAF is the best case at any price I ever used for a build.  Give Cooler Master a try, you won't be disappointed!"

AGTP7JJ4RIBMODM2XMGGVJ4PX4GQ,B0013EMKXC,4,0,False,"In a recent build for a quad core amd we decided to switch from our tried and true Arctic Cooler 64 to the Xigmatek 1283.  Shipping was fast and we were quickly into our build.  Then the frustration began to set in.  The instructions are like many, in all kinds of languages, and about totally useless to try to follow.  The fan is not marked as to which way to mount it, and it took us two tries to get the fan blowing the right way (a topic the instructions don't mention).  The rubber fan mounts are a challenge to get into the slot of the fins without damaging fin or rubber.  And if you need two tries to get the fan pointed right, it just aggravates the problem.  The next thing you notice is this brute is tall.  I mean really tall.  It is tall like you can't use one of those case sides with an air intake shroud.  Since we used the cooler on a quad amd board we used the clips and spring handle.  The clips go onto the am2 socket mounts, and the center bar has two slots that span the top of the heat sink.  The mount is not easily centered.  If you have an intel version you are to mount 4 pegs and use that form.  Thank Goodness we didn't have to do that.  But another sticking point is that the cooler slides along the cross piece that clamp down the device.  That means you have to use your best judgment how to center the thing on the cpu, it isn't easy to see.  Since the fan is offset it is an optical puzzle to center the heatsink on the cpu itself.  You have to pay attention to how the fan connector comes off and where your socket on the mainboard is to position the fan as well.  It isn't a long wire.  SET ASIDE A GOOD 45 MINUTES TO INSTALL THIS COOLER.  THAT BEING SAID, WHEN IT RUNS, IT IS QUIET, AND IT IS EFFECTIVE AS A COOLER.  Oh and I didn't mention the spoiler mount.  There is a separate aluminum curved device that slips into one of the fins and deflects air down towards the socket.  The choice of which fin to use is up to you.  The picture on the directions show it on the third to fourth fin from the bottom.  But a better choice is closer to a third of the way up from the bottom insuring that the fan actually has a chance to drive some air down.  I have no idea if the spoiler is really needed.  It's mount does not lock into place, you have no way of knowing if you get it right or not.  THE PICTURE SHOWS IT OFFSET, BUT WE CENTERED OURS.  Just try not to ruin the fins when you slip it in.  It looks like it would vibrate and rattle, but doesn't on ours.  It just adds to the weirdness of the design.  It's sexy looking, but I can't see it doing much.  IT MIGHT BE FUN TO USE A THERMAL DEVICE AND TEST COOLING WITH AND WITHOUT THE LITTLE SPOILER.  I WOULD BUY ANOTHER OF THESE XIGMATEKS FOR FUTURE BUILDS, BUT ONLY BECAUSE THEY ARE LESS THAN $30 AND NOW I KNOW THE PITFALLS OF CONTRUCTION, SO I AM SURE I COULD CUT THE INSTALLATION DOWN TO HALF AN HOUR.  ONCE IN PLACE IT WILL COOL YOUR QUAD OR TRIPLE CORE BEAUTIFULLY.  SO I'D GIVE THE FAN 5 STARS FOR WORKING IF YOU CAN PUT IT TOGETHER AND MOUNT IT, AND 2 STARS FOR INSTALLATION DIRECTIONS WHICH ARE REALLY DENSE."

I have yet to find anything on Apple's web-site offered by Apple that remotely addresses this problem.<br /><br />Although otherwise this MacBook is an excellent performer, in this day and age there is an absolute need for reliable laptop wireless connectivity. Therefore we are very disappointed in this product's wireless performance as well as Apple's apparent lack of concern for their loyal customer base. After all, what good is a laptop with random wireless connectivity?  One day of this failure mode is one day too many and It is doubtful we will purchase another Apple computer until our confidence in their quality and customer responsiveness is restored. At the very least Apple should issue a statement admitting to the problem, indicating they are attempting to resolve the problem and specify a planned date for its resolution.<br /><br />In the meantime buyer BEWARE of the Apple MacBook MB404LL/A 13.3-inch Laptop (2.4 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo Processor, 2 GB RAM, 250 GB Hard Drive) Black which is an expensive laptop that offers worthless wireless performance!!"

The 16.1 MP with my art on the easel and a tripod, give an excellent image to work with. I used a 3.1 MP Olympus for years and had to sharpen and adjust quite a bit. Even though this is a P&S camera and, ideally I'm told, art images should be shot with an expensive SLR, I've had no such adjustment issues, no consumer issues with the prints and have even had a few excellent gicleés produced.<br />The solid performance of the macro/macro zoom feature is especially appreciated as many of my 'subjects' are floral close-ups.<br />There's a lot to learn to use this camera's features perfectly but for travel and general use it's easy and small, with a good sized LCD - an ideal P&S for sure.<br /><br />Upate: Took some stunning pictures during a recent visit to Italy.

AEFHUW3VL2LGFPPGOQAZ3EHSUZBA,B07L6F5P5W,5,10,True,"Wow, just Wow! I’ve been listening to headphones for decades and have developed quite a inventory over the years but l’ve got to say these have the best sound quality to price ratio l have ever encountered! Eight years ago I pick up the legendary UE TF 10s on Black Friday for 99 bucks, still have them, and these CCA10s blow those out of the water, now that’s progress. The main positive quality the CCA10s have is they never cause pain, no matter the volume, and they reach high levels easily even direct out of iPod touch gen6. As a result one must be careful or you will listen to high levels too long and risk hearing damage very easily. But really, these seem to have an endless amount of torque and never get strained, always having plenty on reserve, and the speedy balanced armatures cooperate nicely digging deep into the mix providing great detail, while the dynamic bass driver keeps pace quite nicely maintaining a coherent sound field, while avoiding mid bass bloat that can sometimes intrude on the mids. And they seam to avoid the deep V signature many affordable earphones display, with great intelligibility of vocals and midrange frequencies while digging deep into sub bass and extending high without sibilance. I’m thinking the multiple drivers add to the excellent stage depth as well as good width, providing a euphoric, holographic image. I have large canals so I typically do not have issues with fit, but they are far more comfortable than the aforementioned TF10, with very good isolation as well. Of the few new chi-fi phones I have experienced lately, these are the best, and really set a new standard for price/performance ratio.<br />Highly recommended 😎👍"

I had an expert photographer friend go over it with me; he found the focusing frustrating (even after changing the focus mode) and controls cumbersome.<br /><br />I compared it to another, more expensive Canon camera recommended by my friend and found that one to be much simpler to use and learn on. I decided to return this one and spend a little bit more on a refurbished version of a more expensive model. Whatever DSLR you go with, you will need either a 40mm or 50mm lens for good indoor photos.<br /><br />Pros: The camera body is lightweight but still sturdy and is small enough to fit comfortably in a backpack or diaper bag. The menus make it easy to use right out of the box.<br />Cons: The zoom is &#34;sticky&#34; as described by other reviewers. Intelligent auto mode is not as easy to use as a point and click. The special artistic modes are not as easy to use as I'd hoped (at least not to create a printable-worthy photo).<br /><br />Bottom-line: I did not feel I could take a quality photo right out of the box (as I could with the camera I bought after returning this one) and I would not recommend this for a first-time DSLR user because of the difficulty with proper focusing..

AHFEUUQPVKSX2UWIIHXADAFY7FMA,B086QSH67R,5,0,True,"I purchased this MB for my new desktop with Core i9-10900K (10th gen 10 core CPU) and NZXT H710i. It's been a while since I built a new rig, so I wasn't sure what to choose but I always like ASUS, and a knowledgeable friend of mine recently got a new ASUS MB and likes it so I followed him. The reasons I picked this MB among many Z-490 MB are (1) there is built in wifi / BT (2) there are two display outputs (HDMI and Display port). I think this is the only ASUS MB that satisfies both. There aren't many MBs with two display outputs because most people who use Z-490 paired with the latest gen Intel CPU use external GPU or two so they don't need to use the Graphics that comes with the CPU and the display outputs using the graphics chip on CPU. But I use the PC for large-scale numerical simulations so I need a fast CPU but I don't need any graphics power. But I want to use two monitors, which is why I wanted to have two display outputs. So far everything is working great, including wifi. I read that the Ethernet connection on this MB might not work well, but I only use wifi so I cannot verify this claim. I might report it when I try wired network connection. The MB fits perfectly to NZXT H710i mid tower case. I even give ASUS Aura sync a try, and attached three LCD strips. They make the PC look great at night. I also use two Samsung SSD and AIO cooler (Kraken X73)  on MB and they work perfectly. Using the BIOS it's easy to OC this monster. I don't use the software, which is so buggy and confusing, so I am inclined to drop one star, but since I uninstall the buggy ASUS software, I decided not to drop a star. So far I am very happy with the hardware (not so much with software)."
AHFEUUQPVKSX2UWIIHXADAFY7FMA,B001CDAZQS,1,10,True,"The good:<br />(1) It's good looking! Some don't like that this shiny fusion finish is a fingerprint magnet, but I love it. I think this is one of the best looking laptops not produced by Apple.<br /><br />(2) It is reasonably priced. This statement can be applied to many Toshiba laptops. Except for some pricy models (like R500), Toshiba seems to set the prices at very competitive levels. Usually Toshiba laptops are much cheaper (conditional on the specs) than Sony, Lenovo, and more or less comparable (but often cheaper) than Dell and HP.<br /><br />(3) Decent keyboard, touchpad (synaptics), sound quality (average for a laptop), screen is shiny. 3 USBs, CD/DVD burner, Built in Camera, Bluetooth, Wirelss (not incl N). It is quiet, probably thanks for the P series processor.<br /><br />The bad:<br />(1) I am worried about the touchpad button. I have been using the laptop only for two weeks, but the response of the right touchpad button (I am lefty so this is the left click button) is already getting less responsive. I used Dell and Lenovo in the past, and there was no problem in touchpad buttons after 4 years of use. I think that is not going to be the case with this laptop. Only for this reason, my next (or future) laptop will never be Toshiba.<br /><br />(2) Toshiba doesn't seems to support XP. I cannot find drivers for XP from Toshiba's webpage.<br /><br />(3) Recovery disk is really bad. I cannot choose which software to install when I implement a clean install. I tried to install without all the crapwares that Toshiba installed, but I cannot, because Recovery disk always recovers the laptop to its initial state (meaning thousands of craps which slow down or crush your PC). I hope Toshiba will include separate Vista disk or explain how to create an independent Vista disk. Also, because the recovery disk installs hundreds of craps, it takes really long time to recover...<br /><br />(4) Customer service is horrible. Toshiba does not seem to accept emails. It took forever (I tried for this review but gave up after 20 min of waiting) to connect to a customer service person.<br /><br />(5) This laptop is too new (using the latest Intel chipset) to be supported by Ubuntu or any major distro of Linux. For a while, you cannot use Linux nor XP, and thus stuck with Vista. Plus, Toshiba is not really famous for the support of Linux...<br /><br />(6) No fingerprint reader. Kind of not steady build (compared with Thinkpad so probably not fair). Battery sticks out; Toshiab cheats a bit with the ""dimension"" of the laptop. It's not as small as the official dimension suggests.<br /><br />The ugly: Amazon<br />I placed an order on August 12th. No update until August 19th, and suddenly I received an email saying that they do not have it in stock and thus they cannot make delivery in line with the estimated schedule. Hopefully Amazon will handle my order MUCH better next time :("
AG5NMII7LZ5MBXPAE2SXCAGCZP7A,B007VLDU8A,2,2,False,"I was really excited to get this product in-hand and installed into my computer.  I have a small home server that I use mostly for NAS, but also as a test/dev server.  I have been keeping my eye open for some sort of drive cage for about a year now to make it easier to swap out failed hard drives.<br /><br />After getting the cage in place in my case and wiring up everything, things seemed to be fine.  As others stated, there are no instructions, so I just used my best judgment.  I had to make some slight modifications to my case to get the cage to go in because my Lian Li case had small metal guides that impeded the cage from going in.  I simply snapped them off with and filed them down the best I code.<br /><br />After I got the cage in I ran into the first problem: The SATA power connectors are too close to allow you to actually insert them.  I read online, and several people said you should be fine with using just the Molex power connectors, so that's what I did.<br /><br />Inserting the drives was easy.  The drive trays are aluminum, not the thickest around but they seem pretty solid.  My primary drive was a Samsung 840 EVO 256gb (more on why it &#34;was&#34; later), followed by a Samsung NAS 3tb and a WD Red 4tb.  The SSD didn't fit as nicely as the HDDs did, as the trays are really designed to hold the 3.5&#34; form factor, but there are holes for a 2.5&#34; on the bottom.  All the trays went in smoothly, and the locks snapped in as expected.<br /><br />About a few days pass and my server locks up.  At first I thought it was the cheap ATI graphics card.  I had some artifacts in the display, so the card was bad, but it's a server so I didn't care, but I replace it.  Server runs for a day, and again kernel panics and freezing.  So now I am thinking maybe I bumped a RAM stick when I installed the cage, so I run memtest for 24hrs, but nothing.  Reboot the server, and again it runs for a few days, then WHAM...SSD drive fails.  So now I am thinking it was the SSD all along, so I call Samsung, get an RMA, and wait.  In the meantime, I purchase an Intel 730 240gb to get the server back online.<br /><br />Re-install of Linux goes fine.  I reseat the RAM and do another battery of memtests just to be certain.  Everything comes up roses.  Start installing stuff back onto the server...WHAM, it locks up again.  This time, it gives me an &#34;ata3.00 exception emask&#34; error on the console.  After some research, it appears that something is happening to the connection to the drive.  I found one review on a competing retailer that mentioned iStartUSA had updated the backplane, and that it wasn't working with 10k or 15k 6Gbps SAS drives, so that may be the problem.  I have double-checked all the SATA cables to make sure they are in well, and it's still happening.  At this point I am afraid to turn it back on to do more tests as I might end up bricking another SSD.  I plan to remove the cage this weekend and go back to non-caged drives.<br /><br />TL;DR;<br />This cage bricked one SSD, and looks like it's disconnecting the drives randomly, or at least the faster SSD drive anyways.  I am taking this out of my server."

Attractive computer, they copied the Apple Macbook look on the keyboard and trackpad.  I felt that my getting an 8th generation Intel chip, 4gb graphics card and a SSD made this PC a really good value for the price.  Runs quiet.  My only issue, which others have mentioned, is the battery drains very fast when this is not plugged in, it was almost dead after 3 hours. However, while this PC is lighter and thinner than most 17&#34; laptops, I'm not going to be lugging this around, its going to stay at home.  So,  having it plugged in all the time isn't a problem for this PC.  Also, compared to the Dell and HP models, this doesn't have a built in drive, but for those few times you need one, external drives are really cheap.

But anyways i'd recommend this laptop i mean it's pretty big it's a 17"" laptop and it's got the intel pentium silver processor with 8 GB ram and 1TB hard drive space so more than enough for anyone in need of a good laptop. And it's good for watching movies and tv shows on netflix or Hulu or anything like that. Or just your normal tasks like checking mail, facebook, news, browsing the web, just any type of reading content it's just an overall nice laptop so far. So yes i'd recommend this laptop but if i have any issues like i did with the hp chromebook i'll come back and say what happened but so far, so good!!! Loving it!!! :D"

AFLQADUD2JKMSOUYUXYK6BDWLXBQ,B000EVOOO8,1,12,False,"I bought drive to backup my work files. Great design, fairly compact. No software included for backups so you have to provide your own. Worked fine for 1 month but drive failed. Would not power up.<br /><br />RMA process costly and at your expense. You must ship in anti-static bag (so save box). No communication or response to 4 e-mails I sent - never had a company be so unresponsive. Not only did I lose 1 month of backups but it cost me quite a bit to ship back.<br /><br />Recommend if you buy it to don't rely solely on it for at least a few months. You have a chance of losing your only copy of something if the drive fails. Hope replacement is more reliable.<br /><br />*Update* Replacement drive was new (not refurbished) and has worked fine ever since.  I must have gotten a bad unit.

AFLGEKHQEJFXTLBOBVVVQOJ6G5EQ,B001G5LCEQ,1,2,False,"I bought this on sale before XMAS 2010 for the excellent price $40. Before I talk about the PCTV HD MINI STICK let me provide you the system I am running it on:<br />Dell Optiplex 620 with 3.2 GHZ Pentium 4, XP PRO, 3 GB of ram and 1 TB hard drive.  Nothing outstanding these days, pretty midddle of the road two year old machine.  The machine is a week old refurb so it's pretty clean in terms of software loads.<br /><br />Installation is mechanically simple.  It is as simple as plugging in any USB device into the PC.  Either you connect it to over the air or cable. One or the other, but not both simultaneously.  The device looks like a typical USB thumb drive.  The kit comes with short extension so you only have to find an open USB port on the back of your PC, plug in the cable, plug in the PCTV tuner, then connect either the cable adapter or the over the air antenna adapter.  I tried it both ways but now have it running with cable input.<br /><br />The software is 120 MB.  I know because I first tested it on my 4 year old Sony Intel Centrino laptop using the antenna.  It worked fine with a very high quality HD over the air signal.  Once tested on the laptop I deinstalled it and put it on by Dell desktop described above. The software setup is your typical clumsy Pinnacle approach.  That is, non intuitive and slow to load and slow to execute commands. The software installation was a non event.  It worked.  I am still expoloring all the hidden options.  Pinnacle often provides options that lead to trials that you end up having to buy an upgrade. So, I haven't been too excited about trying another feature because I hate buying something and then be asked to pay for another feature that's ""optional.""<br /><br />CHANNEL SCANNING<br />Takes longer than a typical new TV. Cable channels come in as Unknown with the channel number but if you click on them once you can add the channel name (e.g., NBC 4 - 203).  You can drag them to favorite channel list as well. Of course, it won't play encrypted channels.<br /><br />Remote tuner<br />Mine works off and on.  It's IR based but I think the IR mouse and keyboard are getting in each others way. I won't use it anyway. A right mouse click gives you access to key features such as channels so all you need to do is right click, click channels and pick another channel with your mouse.<br /><br />How does it work as a HD TV TUNER?<br />The primary function of view HD TV works just fine.  Yes, it works well albeit channel changes take far too long in my estimation. That is, don't expect it to act like the tuner on your Sony Flat screen. You select the channel and wait for what seems like an eternity.<br /><br />Picture quality<br />HD is as good or better than my Sony Big Screen. I am pleased.  I can use it on a my laptop or desktop.<br /><br />Audio Quality<br />My computer system (desktop) has a basic set of speakers with a inexpensive sub woofer.  It sounds fine. If you want to know more then you will have to ask somebody else with a better system that's installed the PCTV.<br /><br />Crashes<br />When first installed on my Desktop the video stream would lock up and go black after 15 minutes. I believe it was caused by the power management scheme I had setup on the desktop.  I am still in the trial mode of this package and have 30 days to make sure it's not another piece of buggy software from Pinnacle.<br /><br />Day 2 update<br />Crashes continue.  I have to reboot to run the program again.  When I restart I always get DVBDecompressor file that won't close and I have to force it close.  I think I am returning this buggy software.  It reminds me of the time I tried Pinnacle Studio.  That program stole endless hours from me.<br /><br />60 day update --<br />After 60 days it won't even startup.  This is typical Pinnacle buggy software.  It simply crashes at startup.  This is a waste of money.  I uninstalled, reinstalled and it still crashes on startup.  I even uninstalled it again AND restored my computer to an early date.  I reinstalled and it still crashes.  What a waste of money. I searched Pinnacle for updates and there are none.  I refuse to waste any more time on this piece of junk.  DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!"
AFLGEKHQEJFXTLBOBVVVQOJ6G5EQ,B0014LC9S0,4,8,False,"I bought this because my entry level Jensen NVX 200 GPS just wasn't cutting it for me. My primary purpose is to use it in rental cars when on a business trips. $13 a day rental is absurd.<br /><br />The Jensen documentation was useless and not intuitive whatsoever.  So, I found the Magellan Roadmate 1412 on sale as a refurb unit for only one hundred dollars.  Documenation was good, but the device is pretty intuitive.<br /><br />WHAT'S IN THE BOX<br />1. GPS<br />2. CAR CHARGE CORD<br />3. Mini USB cable<br />4. Windshield suction cup mount (little short)<br />5. Plastic piece with two sided tape for those who want to stick it on their dash.<br />6. CD with the manual and software for connecting the unit to internet for firmware updates and map purchases (pricey)<br />Note: No 110 volt charger<br /><br />THE SCREEN<br />Well lit with easy to read graphics.  At 4.3 inches it's plenty big enough for my aging Baby Boomer eyes. You can adjust the power level to extend battery life.<br /><br />TOP LEVEL MENU<br />There are six top level menu options.  3 per screen display --<br />1. Show map<br />2. Exit (from Freeway) Points of Interest<br />3. Cancel Route<br />4. Re-route<br />5. Active Trip<br />6. User Options (setup, etc.)<br /><br />BATTERY AND CHARGING<br />Battery is a Lithium Ion cell which charges in a couple of hours.  Don't get sucked into buying a 110 volt charger. You don't need it if you have a USB port on your computer. While the manual says you need to charge with car charger or a separate 110 volt charger ($30 to $40) that is not the case.  The USB connection will charge if you turn the GPS off when it's connected to your PC with a USB mini cable.  (I also found this to be the case with the Jensen GPS)<br /><br />Entering a route is easy.  You go through a series of screens to enter the destination address. When completed you are given four choices to select the route method:<br />1. Fastest time<br />2. Shortest distance<br />3. Least use of freeways<br />4. Most use of freeways.<br /><br />You choose your preference and in a few moments the route is calculated.  Each route can be viewed in a maneuver list that displays direction, distance, and street name. Maneuvers can be deleted from a route.<br /><br />WHAT I HAVE FOUND USING IT<br />Using it in a familiar area where I know the roads I have found only two places where the loaded map was not spot on.  One was an intersection that what was not programmed into the map.  The other was simply a function of the map not being updated in the last 8 months. You can update for free if you buy the unit new in the box.  If you buy a refurb you get the ability to update firmware but map updates are not free.<br /><br />THE DREADED U-TURN WHEN YOU GO OFF ROUTE<br />I only experienced the prompt one time and it was at the intersection of the map error I talked about above. If you do go off route the recalculating is done in a timely fashion.<br /><br />TEXT to SPEECH<br />You simply have to listen to the feminine synthesized voice that utters intelligible speech at a volume I can hear when driving in my van. It's not loud enough if you drive with the windows down at 70 mph and the radio blaring. The pronounciation is sometimes pretty funny.  For example, left on North Haggerty road comes out of the speaker with the following pronounciation; ""Nort Hahherty road.""<br /><br />The text to speech of the route means you really don't have to look at the screen.  Legs of a maneuver are stated, then .5 mile from a turn is spoken to prepare you to turn left or right.  And just before the turn or maneuver you are prompted again just in time to make the maneuver.<br /><br />WINDOW MOUNT<br />I found the suction cup was very difficult to stick to the windshield.  Warming it helped.  The length of the ball and socket arm is too short for me in my van.  I bought an aftermarket vent mount on ebay that works great.<br /><br />Don't forget about charging the GPS via the USB.  It's much more convenient if you travel with a laptop. Just plug the GPS in, and turn it off. The charging will be complete in a couple of hours. Of course, leave your laptop on."

The beauty of this Bose system is it has great sound when watching DVDs at theater volume levels.  I have 5.1 system in another room, but wires are everywhere and you have to decorate around them.  This system works great with my 50"" Samsung.  I like how Bose engineers designed a sound system that accurately reproduces the audio.  There is no over driven bass. Speech is intelligible even in the nosiest scenes.<br /><br />Remember to shut off your internal speakers on your TV.  It makes a big difference in the total sound quality.<br /><br />I was going to buy a Sony Sound Bar but I checked my Amex card points and they offered both for about the same number of points.

AHXUNV656OFRHCTBGKYFCYS6UEHQ,B004UR16ES,4,3,False,"I picked it up at Target for $259 plus tax, but received a $50 store credit card. By using my Target card, I also received 5% off, so the final deal is slightly over $200.<br /><br />I had an unused 40GB Intel solid state drive (SSD) at hand, and installed Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit on it. Considering the sluggish performance and booting time with the original 250GB hard drive spinning at 5400, I would have never kept this netbook, because you can easily have a snack until it boots or while it is loading a program. The 1GHz processor is slow enough to make you wait at any task, and installers start after 5 or 6 seconds, while you keep wondering if you have pressed the right button. On the bright side, at 1GHz, you experience less heat and probably a bit higher battery life (although the screen eats up most of the battery in notebooks).<br /><br />Upgrading is easy: you unscrew the single screw that holds the large cover on the bottom, slide it off, and you can change the RAM (there is room for two memory bays, but one of them hasn't been installed). You will have to lift the HD gently (in order to avoid damaging the connector base), and you can plug in an SSD. According to Acer, these upgrades don't void your warranty as long as you don't end up damaging something (and you put the original parts back if you have to send in the unit for repair). I used a USB stick for installing Windows 7, because I don't need an external DVD drive. Installing a clean OS also rid me of the bloatware.<br /><br />If you get one with the c-60 processor, your wait times will go down by 25% (1.33GHz vs. the 1GHz in the c-50). I haven't checked if the processor is soldered in, but if it isn't, the socket allows a swap-out for a c-60. On the other hand, the SSD makes this machine acceptable for most everyday tasks. At the same time, consider that overclocking the c-50 is unlikely to happen.<br /><br />The BIOS is extremely spartan: you cannot configure anything except for the boot sequence. For instance, I'd love to be able to adjust the fan through the BIOS. Of course, this machine is not a powerhouse, and the BIOS running in the RAM adds to the overhead. Performance-wise, the smaller the BIOS, the better.<br /><br />Upgrading to 4GB of RAM cost me $26, and even if I won't experience a lot of speed increase, more RAM will definitely extend the lifespan of the SSD.<br /><br />This unit received a lot of praise for its battery life. Other reviewers may have received better batteries, but I am actually quite disappointed. Indeed, a better battery would have added $20-30 to the retail price, so the manufacturer's decision to skimp on the battery is understandable. The 4400MAh battery provides computing power for a bit less than 4 hours with everything turned on. Pumping another $50 into a 7200MAh or $60 into a 7800MAh 9-cell is a good idea for people on the road.<br /><br />I personally don't care for the glossy screen; it has a constant reflection, which bothers me. As professional reviewers observe it, the screen is for indoor use: you cannot see much in direct sunlight or even in bright daylight.<br /><br />The AMD graphics processing unit (GPU) amazingly allows the playback of HD video either from the web or from an image file. This unit doesn't have a DVD drive. As the performance of external DVD drives can greatly vary (and I assume 4GB of RAM can alleviate some of your pain with some extra buffering), I cannot say it will definitely work, but based on the other reviews, it might, depending on a number of variables.<br /><br />As for the WiFi, the unit doesn't sense my wireless n at 5GHz, and at 2.4 it keeps connecting at 72 Mbps (a known issue with low-end Broadcom WiFi cards), which is not a whole lot, but good enough to play streaming HD video from the web.<br /><br />With the SSD and the RAM upgrade, I have a fully operational machine that is a bit slower than I would like, but it does everything I need (office apps, internet browsing, e-mail, streaming video). According to other users, quite a few games run fine on this machine, but I wouldn't hold my breath: the 1GHz computing limitation would not allow you to play many of the latest games that require computing power besides a graphics card.<br /><br />The fan is constantly on, so you probably don't want this in your bedroom overnight. The fan noise is moderate, but clearly audible. Good thing you don't need a cooling pad. Theoretically, you can install a fan controller program, but I'll pass on that.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />play HD streaming video<br />does everything with moderation but acceptably for most users<br />LED illuminated screen (adds higher visibility and uses less battery power)<br />both HD and 15=pin video output<br />Sprots channel works fine on it<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />fan noise not adjustable<br />hopelessly slow without an SSD installed<br />battery life<br />low screen visibility in bright light (LED power is limited, and the shiny surface of the screen strongly reflects ambient light)<br />no Bluetooth<br />forget about using Skype with hi-quality video<br />Netflix does not work on this"
AHXUNV656OFRHCTBGKYFCYS6UEHQ,B004N625AK,4,59,False,"[updat on 9/2/12: I have been using this for a year. It is absolutely reliable and the latest firmware (about a month ago) improved on its capabilities quite a bit. Note: I have updated my previous review too.]<br /><br />Verdict: Perhaps the best router for the home user<br /><br />I have owned this router for about 10 days. [ update, 12/2/2012: it is still working fine.] It replaced a Netgear MIMO-g router that has been serving me for four years, and it is still alive as a backup router. I wanted faster connection speed and an intelligent router that gives priority to my VoIP calls over video streaming or downloads. I picked up the N750 at Costco's to make sure I can return it if it does not work out. So far, so good, but I have already encountered the major cons/limitations, so here is my take on the Belkin N750.<br /><br />This router connects at the speed advertised and it does not overheat (a major advantage over other comparable routers). Belkin's customer service is also one of the best in the router business. You might or might not be able to use the advanced features, but at $99, this router matches or beats the features offered in this price range even without the extras. As I use it for its basic features (including simultaneous dual band), I am happy with it.<br /><br />At 300+450, this router is fast. I am able to connect my three laptops, my Blackberry and my Zune without a hitch, getting 1GB/s on the Gigabyte port, 450 on the 5GHz wireless N, and 300MB/s on the second wireless N laptop. Both laptops connect at 5GB/s, only one receives 450MB/s (i5 17"" business notebook), the other laptop is stable at 300 (2.1GHz 12"" dual processor business laptop). This seems to be a limitation on the router, but heck, let it be the worst feature ever I see on it. The third laptop. actually an Acer Aspire One, connects at 72 with its built-in WiFi [update: after I installed an external USB Cisco, it is receiving @300; the laptop apparently is sharing the IRQ between the wireless and the sound port otherwise). This one also has the slowest processor (it's a 1.0GHz net-book).<br /><br />Installation: the router comes with a pre-configured WPA/WPA2 password that you receive on a slip that you can slide into the slot under the router for safekeeping. You can change the password, but the length (8 digits) gives you an idea of the ideal password length: anything longer is likely to slow down wireless connection, which is common on older routers (that usually forced you to use WEP if you did not want to halve the connection speed).<br /><br />Gigabit feature: Works fine. No problems ever.<br /><br />Simultaneous dual band: works fine on multiple computers at both 2.4 and 5GHz at the same time. No slowdowns and no overheating problems when both bands are used.<br /><br />Reliability:  no dropped connections ever. Rebooted twice in the first two days but has been working fine ever since. No overheating problem, which I find a major advantage over comparable routers.<br /><br />Range: the range matches or exceeds the Mimo/g range. The 5GHz band works through thin wooden walls. Strangely, the signal strength tends to change between 4 and 5 bars even when I am sitting within 2 yards from the router. Still, the situation is the same when I am 6-8 yards away. (Sorry, I live in 730 sq. ft., so I cannot tell you about longer ranges. I assume, this router works fine up to 30-50 yards (depending on the band; 2.4 goes farther), but don't take my word for it.)<br /><br />Intelligent router that gives priority to my VoIP calls over video streaming or downloads. (This feature requires some user configuration, and the Belkin setup panel failed to update features first, but worked fine at my second attempt.) [Update: the latest BIOS update has improved this router.]<br /><br />The router comes with two USB ports. You cannot use them, unless you install Belkin's proprietary program, which creates a little overhead, but nothing serious. As using the USB ports requires the router to act as a server, your firewall might go nuts. (Mine did.) Once I realized that I was unlikely to use the USB ports, I uninstalled the program, but the uninstall feature left the internal server in the registry, so I had to reinstall my firewall. (Well, a system restore would have worked too, but I did not have one available.)<br /><br />Belkin has good customer service. Once I encountered the problem with their uninstaller, a tech rep helped me out in less than a minute. They even followed up on their service the next business day! A great advantage over Netgear or Asus, in my experience. Just make sure you get to a real tech rep, because the people answering the support line first usually cannot do much more than read the manual and the internal bulletin (this is universal with high-tech companies). Once you get to their second tier, you get no-nonsense, professional support. Well, there is usually not much to do, because the router is so strongly pre-configured for dummies that there is simply not much to adjust; it's plug-and-play for the average home user.<br /><br />Some users on the web complain that they cannot configure the router as an access point. As far as I know, there is no need for that for the home user. My PDA and my Zune connect to this router without a problem."

I am not sure about slower machines.<br /><br />Also, my laptop has a 128GB 1.8"" Samsung SSD (Solid State Drive) that is slower than 2.5"" SSDs but it still comes up with a respectable 6.9 hard disk score in Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, and  for everyday tasks, it is remarkably faster than spinning drives.<br /><br />I have tried XP Pro, Vista Business, and Win 7 x32 on this machine (HP supports only XP and Vista), and they are slow and clunky. Besides losing 700MB of memory on 32-bit OSs, the machine is also considerably slower on all accounts (Vista works better than XP but even Vista is pushing the limits). With Windows 7 Ultimate x64, however, the unit works like a breeze.

Frustrating. About can $60 buy you a swapout caddy for an internal 2.5"" HD/SSD that replaces the built-in CD/DVD player/writer and adds another USB port.<br /><br />HP's business class warranty is the best; usually a 2-day turnaround (although they guarantee 3-5). This unit had a slightly defective motherboard when I got it (the device driver for the SD card would not load), and it took HP from Monday afternoon to Wednesday morning to send the unit back fully repaired. I keep an image of the first clean installation of Win 7 Ultimatex64 because it can take me about 8 hours to install the OS, the upgrades and my programs if anything goes wrong.<br /><br />Compared with similar laptops, you can get products that perform slightly better than this unit in this price range. Those, however, will not have the spill-proof keyboard, the extreme heat/dust resistance, and the 3-year no-hassle business class warranty (buying anything comparable costs at least @200 most of the time."

That can go over 7 hours on a 9-cell.<br /><br />Plays HD videos fine.<br /><br />The fingerprint reader is not the latest but it works fine and you don't have to type in passwords.<br /><br />Overall security is good on this machine.<br /><br />Fast wireless in Win 7 x64.<br /><br />Sturdy case, spill-proof keyboard, dust/heat resistance.<br /><br />Out of what I heard, the 2530p that have webcams built in, have the best among built in webcams. As I usually don't Skype when I carry the thing around, it turns out that the dual-focus 2GB Logitech that I picked up for $40 on Ebay is a lot better than any built-in webcams for the time being.<br /><br />The machine runs quiet and cool during everyday computing.<br /><br />Only two USB slots, and they are only USB 2.0. Frustrating. About can $60 buy you a swapout caddy for an internal 2.5"" HD/SSD that replaces the built-in CD/DVD player/writer and adds another USB port.<br /><br />HP's business class warranty is the best; usually a 2-day turnaround (although they guarantee 3-5). This unit had a slightly defective motherboard when I got it (the device driver for the SD card would not load), and it took HP from Monday afternoon to Wednesday morning to send the unit back fully repaired. I keep an image of the first clean installation of Win 7 Ultimatex64 because it can take me about 8 hours to install the OS, the upgrades and my programs if anything goes wrong.<br /><br />Compared with similar laptops, you can get products that perform slightly better than this unit in this price range. Those, however, will not have the spill-proof keyboard, the extreme heat/dust resistance, and the 3-year no-hassle business class warranty (buying anything comparable costs at least @200 most of the time."

It is still working but most of the silver is gone and the buttons are getting weak and vague. So it was time to get another one...thought I go high tech and shop for something different. Bought a Logitech Trackman...gonna give that ball thingy to my son...the search continued. Well to make a long story short...<br />"" I'm back"".

AEM7GPBL4Y7H3ZCNPJUB2OW3ATNQ,B074XN1LH3,5,0,False,"My tour so far with the Sonos is rather uneventful.<br /><br />First, I did the usual thing guys do.  I took it out, threw the instructions aside adn plugged it into my router and the power and a light came on.  I was thrilled.  Now what?  I know, &#34;ALEXA!&#34;...nothing.  Darn.<br /><br />I really do not want to read those instructions and this thing shouldn't make me right?  So, any buttons.  Hmmm, oh, yeh, there is one behind the thing.  I will hit that.  Yay.<br /><br />Flashing blue light turns red.  A nice musical tone comes out for an instant, and it starts flashing the light red.  Then the red light turns solid.  I did something.  ALEXA????  Nothing.<br /><br />Well, my phone is on wifi, but maybe this thing forces bluetooth even if it is hooked up to the network.  Must be a Sonos app somewhere.  Grab the phone and whatever you do DO NOT READ THE INSTRUCTIONS.<br /><br />Sure enough.  Sonos App.  Download.  Wow, what a setup sequence.  Easy but lots of steps.  Must connect through wifi initially, ugh.<br /><br />OK, cool, Alexa talks to me and tells me all kinds of nonsense like how many teaspoons are in a tablespoon and who the first Roman Emporer is.  It also tells me most people my height weigh less than I do.  Hey, I am not fat.<br /><br />Alexa makes me laugh a couple of times when I try just random banter.  LOL.<br /><br />The speaker is heavy for its size, which makes it sit solidly in place.  It also likely causes the solid tonal resonance it has.  Will have to try music next, but it says I have to install the Alexa app.  Here we go again.  Bear in mind, I have not read a single instruction.<br /><br />Alexa play some music.  Oh, I need to install apps again. LOL.  OK.  Oh, select default music player service?  A 30 day free trial to Amazon Music to play any song I like any time with no commercials?  Sweet.  But I don't like installing all these apps on my phone.  Oh well, no biggie.<br /><br />Alexa play Tom Petty.  Alexa responds asking me if I want to shuffle some Tom Petty Music and off we go.  Turn it up Alexa.  Louder Alexa.  Louder Alexa.  Not bad.<br /><br />Tonal resonance is darned good for a small speaker.  Wonder if I can get it to crank these tunes through my stereo system.  I don't have a smart receiver, but I am certain that will be another doo dad I will need to buy.<br /><br />Although, really, all I would need to control things through Alexa would be for it to interface with my Harmony Remote system.  Or a PC connection would work, because the PC is connected to the stereo...of course.<br /><br />Hmmm.<br /><br />Now, I have Google's talk app on my phone too.  My feeling is they are very similar.  Alexa feels a tad more refined.  I ask Google if it knows Alexa and it says Alexa has a soothing voice.  LOL.  OK, I am literally having conversations with electronics now.  And the responses are relatively intelligent.  AI is alive and well.  Or rather not alive, but doing well.  LOL.<br /><br />I have to continue this journey of voice activation and interaction with these devices, but I am enjoying it thus far and these things are actually pretty good at humor too so they have made me laugh several times.  More than most people do.  LOL.<br /><br />Back adding more of my experience.  Good morning Alexa and Good night Alexa get interesting results.  The thing I notice is I am listening to my music much more often.  I am in the mood I say Alexa play Tom Petty, and voila.  Requires a service of 7.99 a month to do it to that level but with the service the choices are endless and easy.<br /><br />I am disappointed that it cannot hook up to my stereo like echo can.  So if you want to have Alexa control your stereo, the echo is a cheaper and better solution.  This is better as a satellite for kitchen, bedroom, etc.  It sounds great, but there is no way it could possibly sound as good as good larger speakers.  Given I am usually near my stereo I can use the echo.<br /><br />But the uses are endless elsewhere, such as bath, bedroom, hallway, basement, etc. although you would spend a bundle putting one in each room and an echo and a small stereo setup would be cheaper.  It has line out.  This speaker does not.  Would be better if it did, but that is not the idea of this product.  I have more to learn about it in terms of bluetooth.  I will have to return for that experience."
AEM7GPBL4Y7H3ZCNPJUB2OW3ATNQ,B005FPT38A,1,6,False,"UPDATE: Please read this entire review before saying you do not find it of assistance.  If you have an ATI card, you will spend days on this unit and it will likely never work right.<br /><br />In addition, after changing over to an Intel system with which it does work, the driver and/or firmware still have bugs that are reported elsewhere on the web.  The tuner fails in Media Center regularly.  Media Center stops recording when this happens, and the only apparent solution is to power the unit on and off and/or reboot Windows both of which require you be physically present.  This makes the unit WORTHLESS when on travel.<br /><br />I have purchased a new tuner and plan on experimenting with it.  In the meantime, because this does not work properly with many graphics cards and randomly stops working about every 2 days, I see it as a garbage device.  I depend on my DVR to record when I am not at home and I CANNOT DEPEND ON THIS DEVICE.<br /><br />Again, read the review before you put it down.  If you have an ATI card or travel and require your system to record while you are gone, this system will not work for you and will cause constant consternation.  And Hauppauge tech support is no help at all blaming everything but the box itself.<br /><br />As far as my original report goes, Hauppauge has NOT offered any solutions.<br /><br />------------------ORIGINAL REVIEW----------------------------------------<br /><br />I am flagging this with one star because of the overall misguided and questionable tech support I have received on this item.  I did eventually get it working (with non-premium channels), but it took a ton of perseverence, a strong knowledge of Windows 7, and time.  People that are not tech savvy will likely never get this tuner to work without considerable help from their cable company and Hauppauge support.  And if you have ATI/AMD graphics on your computer, you will likely never get it to work properly with premium channels, although with perseverence you may find a solution.<br /><br />I have had a multi-day experience with this box that, in retrospect, was totally unnecessary.  This series of support problems had to do with just basic operation of the box, proper activation of the cable card, and installing the correct versions of the firmware and drivers (no small feat).  Even after all of this, and knowing the box is finally working correctly, premium channels do not work on my AMD/ATI based system. And support folks have blamed everything but the actual problem.<br /><br />I don't completely understand why ATI cards and drivers have problems with these tuners, but I know they do.  And the problem appears to only exist on premium channels like HBO. And it also appears that Hauppauge support knows it and only gives it cursory mention like it has all been fixed.  It has NOT.  My system is new, it has the latest drivers, the system works great in every way, but not with HBO on this tuner.<br /><br />Now, to be fair, a huge part of the problem initially was poor support from my cable company.  I spent hours on the line with their support folks, and they kept wanting to send out a technician because most of the support people that work for them have no idea what they are doing or are just plain lazy.  After several days and half a dozen tries, I finally spoke to someone that discovered the original support person had entered an incorrect number when ""pairing"" the devices.  I do not want to get into it in detail, but there are three long numbers involved in ""pairing"" the device and if one digit is wrong, it will not work.  And one of those numbers, in my case, had been entered incorrectly.  And it took six calls to their technical staff to chase it down.  I was reluctant to have their tech come to my house because the box is not supported, so they charge an hourly rate if it is not their equipment.  And the driver updates, etc. I had to do along the way, he would not have been able to do or even known about.  So, I believed it would be an expensive exercise in frustration.  I bought the box, after all, to save money on the rental of my DVR and to get more control over my recordings, not to spend triple the cost of a month's cable service on a tech.<br /><br />Hauppauge support exacerbated the problem.  Their support person immediately blamed the cable card (standard finger pointing technical support).  He said some customers get five cable cards before one works.  Knowing electronics and understanding what he said was impossible, I pursued the problem without giving his statement much credence.  It is impossible for what he says to be true because the cable companies use the same cards in all their DVR and rented cable boxes.  If such a huge number of cards was bad, then a huge number of customers would not be able to activate their DVRs or cable boxes, and that is simply not the case.  The reason the card swapping likely works is ONLY because the cable company will eventually get the card to activate properly.  It is incredibly difficult to do and most of them, apparently, have no idea how to do it.  So, sooner or later, you will get a tech that knows what he is doing and the card will work.  And the most common reaction will be to blame the cards, but it was poor tech support and complex procedures that result in the failure, not the card.<br /><br />So what is fact?  That most cable company support people do not know how to activate a cable card, and if the device into which the card is installed does not belong to them, they are less inclined to want to support it for free.  If anyone tells you it is the card, they are likely dead wrong.  They rarely fail.<br /><br />The diagnostic software from Hauppauge's website (downloaded separately) was telling me the card was not activated as was Media Center.<br /><br />But because the diagnostic software from the site is flawed, it presents errors that do not exist.  It says Windows is not activated for example, and that Digital Media Adviser in Media Center has not been run, when neither report is accurate.  How these bugs have been allowed to persist in their software when they are a simple check of the Windows registry values is beyond imagination, but it immediately makes you doubt what you are reading when you run the diagnostic.<br /><br />The Hauppauge support person said that if the cable company insisted the card should be activated and it wasn't, the card was bad.  He was wrong.  The card would not activate simply because the cable support team did not know what they were doing.  If your card does not activate, it is a problem with the configuration by the cable company, a bad connection (which should be evident from the diagnostics), or bad firmware for the tuner (make sure to get the latest from the Hauppauge site, don't bother with their included installation disc).<br /><br />So, the card would not activate, but I could tune, watch and record all non-premium channels fine.  Many folks might just give up there and be satisfied.  If you don't have premium channels, who cares?  But for many cable companies, this may not be the case.  Bottom line is if it works well enough for you, you can punt until it doesn't, because even with a completely non-activated cable card, the box tuned every channel perfectly for me except HBO.<br /><br />The Hauppauge support person suggested I update firmware (then realized I already had), update drivers for the device (then realized I already had), cycle the box, etc.  Then he told me to get a new cable card.  I didn't buy it.  I was right.<br /><br />When the cable company finally figured out how to activate the card, it turns out that the diagnostic program for the tuner had been correct, and the card was not properly activated or paired despite what cable company support staff had been telling me.  It wasn't the tuner at all.<br /><br />I could have requested they send out a tech, but at $50 an hour, it would have been expensive.  And they charge if the box is not theirs which is understandable.  However, he would have likely gotten it activated more quickly than the inept telephone support staff.  He still, however, would not have solved the ultimate problem.  He likely would have figured out the pairing issue, but he would not have been able to get this tuner to work with HBO on my computer.<br /><br />With the card activated and working flawlessly, every channel except HBO worked, but that was the case before it was activated.  HBO would just generate a black screen, no picture or sound.  The cable company blamed the tuner and Hauppauge blamed the cable company hardware.  Neither suggested it was the video card, despite the fact that Hauppauge apparently knows about the issue, at least to a degree.<br /><br />On a lark, because of sparsely reported problems with ATI cards in the past, I decided to just try a different computer, one with Intel graphics.  And lo and behold, everything worked like a champ.  It tuned HBO perfectly.<br /><br />So, what have I learned that you should know.  These tuners do not work properly with the ATI 6310 video cards, and likely many other ATI cards, when using the most recent drivers from AMD/ATI.  And it is not clear what drivers the tuner would work with.  I could not get any version of the drivers to work.  But I have not spent the hours necessary to chase down each possible setting in the driver configuration.  Hopefully someone that has will post the solution if there is one.<br /><br />A pdf from Hauppauge states to turn off a feature in the driver, but that feature is not visible from the driver software, at least not in recent versions.<br /><br />Regardless of what graphics card you are using, ensure your cable card is activated and ""paired"".  If the diagnostic program and Hauppauge software do not tell you that you are subscribed to HBO and you are activated, get the cable company to do their job and get it activated.  If you have problems, and the signal quality is reported as good by the diagnostics, then your cable company is at fault.  But they will likely continually blame the tuner and/or try to send out a tech.<br /><br />If you have an ATI card of any kind and cannot get HBO to work, get Hauppauge support, which to their credit does respond, to get you the proper fix.  So far, I have not been able to get it out of them, but it likely involves disabling features in the existing ATI driver or falling back to some stable version and blocking updates.  Hauppauge should have it plastered all over their support site.<br /><br />If you are not tech savvy, do NOT expect this tuner to work out of the box if you have an ATI graphics card or are using on-board AMD graphics (ATI graphics chip).  Getting it to work with any card is hard enough, and will likely require you get a cable company tech to come to assist you.  But premium channels will most likely NOT work with AMD/ATI graphics drivers.  And if you are not tech savvy, you will not get any real help from the support team.  In fact, you may not even know what a graphics chip is or a graphics card.  You will need step by step instructions, and they are just plain not available.  If you get it working, consider yourself incredibly lucky.<br /><br />If you are tech savvy, you can save yourself a ton of time realizing there is a true problem with the ATI drivers and expect that premium channels will not work, but focus primarily on getting all diagnostics to pass (with the exception of the bugs mentioned in the Hauppauge diagnostic software).  If the software says you activated, are subscribed to a premium channel and the signal is good, and you are getting a black screen or errors when trying to tune that channel, it is an incompatibility with the tuner and the graphics chip/card drivers.<br /><br />Does this box work?  Absolutely.  Is it a solid piece of hardware?  Yes.  Will it work well for you out of the box?  Likely not.  Will you spend hours with it and perhaps get totally frustrated and give up?  Likely.<br /><br />So, this box gets one star until Hauppauge support gets their act together and updates their web site to explain that ATI drivers do not work with their box for premium channels OR provide a clear fix on their support page.  They also have to fix their diagnostic software and make it part of the standard installation, not make people go to their website and hunt it down.  And their instructions have to be improved to prevent endless hours chasing ghosts.<br /><br />It is not clear that this problem exists with other tuners.  It may be a generic problem across all tuners.  And Hauppauge appears to have had information regarding the problem on their website, but now makes it impossible to view (another website problem).  They may want to hide the problem to keep potential buyers from getting discouraged.  After all, a huge number of folks have AMD/ATI graphics chips/cards.  But it is maddening.<br /><br />If I get a final setting fix for the ATI drivers that work, I will post it here.  But it is my contention that people should not be going to the Amazon reviews for technical support.  And bad technical support is worse than none at all.<br /><br />When Hauppauge gets their act together, I will up this to a five star review.  Until then, this is likely an unusable box for many people, especially for premium content."
AEYW74Q7XFOME44IKUEBMARHEVXQ,B00HXZ34EY,2,8,True,"I have to admit that after using my MacBook Air for a week or so with this keyboard cover, I need to completely change my original review.  So, I’ve deleted my review and have written this complete edit.<br /><br />I'm using the Mosiso Ultra Thin Clear Soft TPU Keyboard Cover Skin on a MacBook Air, which is the MacBookAir6,1 [Intel Core i7; 1.7 GHz; DuoCore] model [A1465 US Keyboard].<br /><br />As it turns out, the Mosiso Ultra Thin Clear Soft TPU Keyboard Cover Skin does not actually fit perfectly, as I originally thought it did. I thought the looseness of the cover was entirely due to the fact that it's &#34;Soft TPU&#34; as opposed to silicone, whatever soft TPU is.  The rubberiness of the silicone makes that kind of keyboard cover more skid resistant.  Thus, it doesn't move around when you type.  This one does.  And, if there's a swift breeze, the cover will blow off my keyboard, which actually happened. That incident made me look at the keyboard cover more carefully.<br /><br />I'm not sure if the bad fit is why it's a little bit more difficult to type with this cover on.  It definitely has a different feel than I'm used to with my other silicone keyboard covers for my iMac and MacBook Pro 15&#34;.<br /><br />I took two photos of the keyboard cover’s fit on my MacBook Air, one of the left side of the keyboard and the other of the right side of the keyboard.  You will see how the keys and raised shapes are shifted, fitting perfectly on the left but not so much on the right.<br /><br />I only removed one star from my 3 star review, because many of the reviewers seemed to think that this keyboard cover fit perfectly.  I may have gotten a reject or my keyboard may be slightly different from theirs.  Given that the keyboard responsiveness is so subjective as well, I thought 2 stars would be appropriate."

Marvell Controller supports a single internal SATA 6.0 Data only storage device and includes a eSATA connection on the back of the case.  USB 3.0 support is provided by intel and Asmedia chipsets.  I have an Asmedia controller on my z68 board and it has functioned flawlessly with every device I have connected to it.  Both USB controllers support high speed charging function.  Includes 3 4pin chassis fan headers managed by Asus QFAN in BIOS or through Asus Probe II Desktop Utility.  Lowers power consumption and keeps your work environment quiet.  Onboard EPU and TPU switches can also be controlledmanually or in BIOS.  AHCI/RAID supports 0, 1, 5, 10.  HD Audio / AC'97, Realtek Gigabit NIC.<br /><br />Board layout is executed well.  This particular board is intended for multi GPU SLi as cross-fire set ups. Slots are positioned evenly and you won't run into fitment issues with larger cards unless your case is small or has a larger tha normal drive cage.  All connectors are easy to reach, even if you have larger hands.  This model does not come with an Asus Q Connector block, so you'll need to connect these directly to the pins/header yourself.<br /><br />The real beauty of this board lies in it's BIOS.  It includes a comprehensive set of features with Auto or Manual configuration.  Want to overclock your memory or processor, no problem.  Asus also inclues it's TPU feature which can automatically OC your CPU and memory safely. My z68 has been a solid performer, but this z77 platform has picked up where it left off, adding more options and configurable features.  The BIOS flashback feature alone is wonderful, and allows recovery from a failed BIOS flash in the majority of cases.  You hope you never have to use it, but it's there if you need it.<br /><br />Things you may want to pick up with this board.  A 2 port USB 3.0 header for the front of your case if it doesn't support it.  Adding it will give you 3.0 support on the front of your case in addition to 2.0.  Helpful for charging your phone or tablet, also great for 3.0 disks.<br /><br />This is a fantastic, mid priced, feature rich board.  My experience with it and other Asus products has been stellar.  System build was for my mother.  She couldn't be happier."

This purchase was intended for a mid range desktop that doesn't see any gaming.  While overkill for its intended purpose, it appeared to be a good value at it's price point.  I have had nothing but stellar experience with EVGA cards in the past.  Based on cursory review, this card appeared to fit the users needs. (Build was for Mom)<br /><br />Unfortunately, I can't attest to the cards gaming performance since we never got past the sound of its fan.  The card sounds like a jet engine regardless of the fan % setting specified.<br /><br />It sounds like a hairdryer on it's high setting.  This is with fan % set to 21% (lowest setting), system idle, core temp 22-24c.  At the lowest setting, the fan is screaming.  I paired it with the latest forceware drivers and EVGA PrecisionX 4.0.1.  Change the fan % to 70% and speed increases, but there is only a discernable change in the pitch of the fan sound.  Overall, it still sounds like it wants to tear itself out of the case.  Literally!<br /><br />After visiting the EVGA forums, I see this complaint has been mentioned by many users who have this series, 650, 650Ti, and SC.  As of this writing, there are no performance related bios updates, fan unlockers, etc available.  Others might be willing to accept this, but the noise this thing generates is intolerable for anyone who is expecting a quiet workspace.  I understand fan speed increases when the card is being pushed, but several family members actually asked me ""what is that noise""? when they entered the room...  PC sitting idle.  If you don't mind fan noise that dominates your environment, this card might be right for you, but if you are accustomed to quiet until you start gaming...  you will not be happy with this card.<br /><br />Note: The video was shot with an iPhone 5 held approximately 1 foot from the back of the case.  Case sitting in the middle of the room and is not near any walls or obstructions that might reflect sound.  This is how it sounds from the moment the power button is pressed.  System idle, core temp 22-24c.  **Edit - I untimately opted for a GTX660 FTW Sig2 (my z68 based rig) and put its twin fan 560Ti DS SC into the system below.  Whisper quiet.  Now that I have had a few weeks to research this and gain feedback from others, I would recommend a 650Ti Boost at a minumum, or one of EVGA's Sig2 models.  The single fan design on Boost models and the higher end cards are indeed quiet.  The single fan design on the base model 650's (which is different) is noisy.<br /><br />Specs:<br />Asus p8z77-V-LE Plus<br />i5 3570K ivybridge<br />16 GB Corsair Vengeance<br />Intel 520 SSD 120GB Boot<br />WD Black 1TB Data"

Auto Tuning offers you an easy way to automatically optimize the system for fast, yet stable clock speeds.  Takes much of the trial and error out of overclocking and allows you to revert if you go too far.<br /><br />The EPU chip gives system wide energy optimization by automatically detecting current PC loadings and intelligently moderating power consumption.  This reduces fan noise and overall power consumption.  If you're like me, then you want to work in a quiet environment.<br /><br />If I could have my every wish, this board would have come with (4) 6Gbs ports on the z68 chipset, instead of 2.  Hardly a complaint and something I can live with.  Superior out of box performance and experience.  ***Update: I now own two of these boards.  Both work flawlessly!

Firmwares change and don't work with the tools you finally figures out how to discover and program it. Only a useless chat tech support that I still think is just a robot and not an intelligent human being. Because it keeps getting back to a keyword you fed it earlier in the &#34;conversation&#34;.

Well guess what Ubiquiti discontinued the product and replaces it with yet an other Beta product (mesh).<br /><br />I waisted 8 hours getting this unit to work. One was a broken POE power supply that did provide power but did not pass trough data. Given the temperamental behavior od Ubiquity products it takes a while to figure out this basic condition because one never knows what secret button needs to be pushed to make it work

I think your computer has to be compatible with the defective firmware to run the firmware update program.<br /><br />Anyway, the new firmware did the trick and I haven't had any other issues. Not buying an OCZ SSD again, though - the whole process took over a month to resolve and way more of my time than it was worth."

I have an early intellicode opener, and it programmed quite easily.<br /><br />I had been using a &#34;Clicker&#34; (by Liftmaster) universal keypad, but when I upgraded my 30 year old Genie Professional to a newer model, the newer unit used intellicode, and the Clicker would not work with it.  There are clickers that do work with Geni Intellicode, but I figured I might as well buy the genuine article, as the price was right, and it was the latest model, in case I have to change my unit again in 30 years, maybe it will still work with the new one. :)"
AELYPIYCIZUCXZC2VCOGB6IKFHJQ,B005IHAIJ8,4,4,False,"This camera has turned out to be a pleasant surprise for me. Build quality is excellent. That wasn't a surprise. And, I knew that it was capable of producing excellent photos. My concerns had more to with the NEX system's lack of high quality lenses and how much I would like the mostly touch screen interface.<br /><br />As to the interface, that's part of the pleasant surprise. I'm not sure that a few years ago I would have taken to it quite as well. Thank Apple and the iPhone for educating me on the advantages and ease of screen based controls. With a quick button push and Sony's well thought out basic controls, I can quickly get to and change the settings I most often access. The touch focusing and focus tracking are wonderful.<br /><br />One other thing that surprised me is how useful the intelligent auto setting has turned out. As someone who usually shoots in aperture priority or manual mode, I'm used to making all the exposure decisions for my photos. Just to try the camera out, I shot an afternoon letting the camera make those decisions for me. In normal lighting situations, it did a great job, quite consistently. Subsequent experiments have shown me that I can actually trust the camera enough to leave it on IA for quick snapshots. I would never have imagined that possible. When the light gets dim, I switch back to aperture priority and control the ISO settings. The intelligent auto setting doesn't understand tripods.<br /><br />Low light is another area where I've been pleased. I normally think of most cameras special modes as marketing gimmicks, or toys that people play with for a while then forget. The NEX's hand held night function actually works very well, allowing me to take a number of indoor photos in low light that came out great. The hand held HDR function is also something that I'll use occasionally in high contrast lighting.<br /><br />My biggest problem in choosing a NEX camera has been the lack of small, light, high-quality lenses. That's still a concern for me. I'm okay with the kit lens. It's quite good for what it is. But it does have its limits. Until Sigma came out with their 30mm lens for the NEX system ([[ASIN:B0078ZYBP0 Sigma 30mm F2.8 EX DN- Sony E 330965]]), I wasn't interested in the system. That has turned out to be a good lens that gives me some of the compact size and image quality that I felt was lacking. It matches this small and light camera with a small and light lens that is sharp and has a decently large aperture at F/2.8. That makes the NEX-5N into a very good street photography camera.<br /><br />That's a lot of rambling to say that this is a good camera for experienced photographers, within limits. It's not a replacement for your DSLR. It is a good street/travel camera. Some more small prime lenses would help us a lot. For those who are moving up from point and shoots, this is a great camera. The image quality is excellent, the controls are good, as is the touch base menu system. And the camera has what appears to be a pretty good built in help system.<br /><br />P.S. Two extras made my experience with the camera better. I've already mentioned the Sigma 30mm lens. There's an Arca Swiss compatible tripod plate made by SunwayFoto (check eBay) that's specifically designed for the 5N. The quality is good. It allows access to the battery/card bay on the camera bottom and lets the swiveling screen to work normally."
AHLJANANMZ4XSEHEGGL2YQFZRZGA,B01GIUYQ3M,1,1,True,"I purchased this for a PC we use in the Family Room, connected to a 1080P TV/monitor and it works fine. I was looking for a performance boost over the Intel graphics integrated into our @ 2012 PC and it fit the bill. The only problems I've had with the card are that - when first installed - the PC identified the card as an HD 7700 (an earlier version of the chipset). That created some issues with switching from cable TV to PC operation (I got frequent green screens, which I never had with the Intel chipset). Once I figured out that I didn't have the latest R7 240 driver installed and had Windows 10 install that, the problem was solved. Additionally, I've grown used to video cards being virtually silent and this one isn't. It isn't exactly loud, but you can hear the fan when sound is not playing. That's not the experience I was looking for, but for $62 I can't complain too much.<br /><br />9/18/16 Update: Well, sadly I was wrong in believing that the updated driver(s) would solve the issue. I am still having a problem with switching from TV to PC, I even purchased the latest standard HDMI cable to see if that would solve the problem. Now, the screen goes black when switching from TV to PC (though not the other way). I am truly perplexed and am seriously considering dumping this card. I really don't want to have to re-plug the cable into the back of my PC each time I switch viewing modes. I'm going to give this card a two star rating since it works, though with much annoyance.<br /><br />I hope MSI reads these reviews, because I'd like to keep the card if they can help me with a solution. Otherwise, it's going back."
AHLJANANMZ4XSEHEGGL2YQFZRZGA,B001GIAWAS,5,2,False,"Where do I begin? I've been searching for a quality video card to use with Linux for quite some time and have been disappointed more than once.<br /><br />After experimenting with a couple of ATI cards (a Radeon X1650 and the very recent HD4350), as well as Intel integrated chipsets (both GMA915 and GMA950), I finally came to the conclusion that Nvidia is the only way to go.<br /><br />While none of the above create drivers for Linux that are anywhere near as good as the ones they produce for Windows or OSX, Nvidia at least makes some effort to write half-way decent drivers. So performance (at least in KDE-based Linux distributions) is OK with a reasonably good processor.<br /><br />When I saw the XFX 9500GT available for only $60, I went for it. The vendor I used (not Amazon) also included a free copy of Call to Duty 4 which, ironically, I installed on my Windows 7 PC using an ATI Radeon HD4670 card (great graphics, BTW).<br /><br />So far, so good. This card works very well in Mandriva 2010, is pretty quiet, and runs at about 60 degrees centigrade on my PC.<br /><br />XFX does a very good job of packaging its cards, and the documentation is very impressive. I'm happy, and for the price and performance, I'm sure you will be too."
AE2PIZ3MS7HJFTM2UK4VAITPXUAA,B005C31F2M,5,15,False,"I purchased this card to upgrade my Dell XPS 8300.  The power supply on the 8300 is somewhat restrictive at less than 500W.  I could tell from their website specs that this card is likely their ""high end"" option.  Amazon's price is MUCH better than Dell's upgrade cost and installation is a breeze.<br /><br />The card requires two power connectors but the 8300 has them.  Also, the 8300 case is a bit narrow and this version of the card fits with a little room to spare.  It's a bit noisy but that's pretty common for a card with these specs in this price range.<br /><br />Overall, you won't be disappointed and for those of you wondering if this is compatible with Dell's XPS 8300 - it is.

AEEFDB5HGXZPRAVTHRBJOUKMWXIA,B00HUBK82C,5,10,True,"I swear my Samsung BD-F5900 is a brand new unit. I love factory refurbs. They are usually like new. But with only a 90 day warranty, which is usually normal for refurbished items, I purchased the $5.00 2 year extended warranty. So I'm covered if there are any issues.<br /><br />Taking it out of the box, I immediately knew I made the right choice. It's shiny, sleek and compact. Some say there is no display and the buttons suck? Well I have a display on mine and it is vivid, and the buttons work perfectly. I also like the remote. It is very easy to use. Mine came with the unit, remote, book and HDMI cable. I did not get any batteries, but that was no big deal.<br /><br />I placed my unit in my rack, plugged it in, hooked up the HDMI to my receiver and turned it on. It immediately took me to a setup screen. Initial setup was a breeze. It is very explanatory. If you have trouble, it is probably because you just don't understand what you are doing. So just find someone who does. My firmware upgrade was also easy. I searched and it found a new version, it downloaded and installed. Then I proceeded to set my defaults, logged in to my Samsung account, upgraded the Smart Hub App Store software, and installed my Apps. Boom, I'm ready.<br /><br />It has the Smart Hub, which I love. This is why I DID NOT purchase the newer H5900 model (What was Samsung thinking). Also the NEW model does not and never will support Amazon Instant Video (I called Samsung). Most apps suck too. This F5900 model is loaded with all the features and Apps you expect to find with the Smart Hub.<br /><br />Others complained about no apps and missing everything. You have to log into your Samsung account, before you can go to the App store and download anything. If you don't have a Samsung account, you have to create one before you can upgrade Smart Hub and download any Apps at all.<br /><br />The player is super fast, super quiet and loaded with features. I especially love where you can watch a normal DVD and it up-converts to 1080. It is a lot clearer. Blue-ray is vivid. I can't test 3D, because my TV is not 3D.<br /><br />The sound quality through my 7.2 receiver is amazing. Whatever the disc dishes out gets reproduced perfectly through my receiver. The volume is lower, but I just adjusted my receiver's Intelli-volume to match the other inputs. Also, some mention no audio through the HDMI, and Samsung told them that they needed to hookup an optical cable. Well that information is FALSE. HDMI out from the F5900 fully supports Video and Audio. So if you do experience this problem, it may be your receiver or TV causing this. Remember there are different version of HDMI. So older receivers may not support audio, just like older receivers do not support 3D throughput through HDMI.<br /><br />The WIFI is fast and excellent (I have FIOS). I streamed Amazon and Netflix without any hesitation and the picture is unreal. It even plays them at a higher rate.<br /><br />Overall, I am extremely HAPPY. I'm glad I chose this over any other unit in the price range. It is well built, looks great, works perfectly, is loaded with all the features you would want and need. What more can you ask for.<br /><br />I recommend this unit to anyone wanting a 3D Blue-Ray player with Smart Hub, Network and Wireless, All Share (which is great. I stream my Ipad, computer and cellphone to the TV) and so many more features. I may buy another one for the bedroom.<br /><br />Buy one, you won't regret it!"

I didn’t experience any issues.<br /><br /> The keyboard ranks as pretty good, but I much prefer Lenovo keyboards.<br /><br /> The flexibility of the unit is really excellent. I use it a lot as a tablet with a third-party holder. It’s heavy, but tolerable, though I almost always rest it on a table or my lap.<br /><br /> So far, I haven’t had any quality issues. Build quality on this unit is excellent.<br /><br />But I am very wary of Dell products. Battery life appears to be fairly short, around four hours, though I am sure you could get more out of it with Scrooge-like power management techniques.<br /><br />The unit is pretty light. I suspect it will become my regular travel computer.<br /><br />Overall, I like it – but I worry because it’s a Dell. Once  upon a time, Dell stood for quality. Not so much any more. But maybe they’re coming back. Time will tell, but so far, so good.<br /><br />Jerry"

Transitioning from one NAS to another is not necessarily a simple process, so it will be a while before I put the 526X fully online. When it comes to data, I am an extremely cautious person. I always read the manuals, several times if I need to so I understand the system. In this case, there’s a lot to understand.<br /><br /> The NetGear ReadyNAS OS 6.7 manual is a dense 255 pages. The Operating System has just about every feature you could want, including DLNA capability, automatic RAID configuration, a rather interesting cloud capability called ReadyCloud, built-in free anti-virus, snapshot recovery capability and much more. These capabilities can be expanded and enhanced by about 50 currently available add-ons, both free and paid.<br /><br /> I am more interested in the software than the physical box, but the hardware is impressively powerful with an Intel “2.2GHz Dual Core Server Processor based on the Intel Broadwell architecture” and 4GB of DDR4 ECC RAM (which is expandable to 64GB). The unit will, according to NetGear, support up to 80 users. This is the six-bay model and will support 10TB drives. (I’ll be starting it with the four 4TB drives currently running in the QNAP.) This is a large and heavy box. It measures about 11 x 8  x 10 inches and weighs more than 17 pounds without drives.<br /><br /> As I mentioned, I am super-cautious when it comes to preserving and protecting data, so I will be moving slow in bringing this NAS online. I’m going to start with a pair of 2TB drives as I learn what I can do with this NAS and how to administer it.<br /><br /> Frankly, from what I’ve read so far, this is a little like transitioning from a light piston-powered aircraft to a multi-engine jet transport. I think it’s going to be a fun ride.<br /><br /> While it is likely that this is overkill for my current small operation, the NetGear ReadyNAS 526X looks like it would be right as home in just about any small business environment.<br /><br /> As I learn through experience, I will amend my review.<br /><br />Jerry"

This could limit their usefulness with productivity applications in an office or home business setting. The lack of connectivity n many of these compact laptops can also be a problem.<br /><br /> Enter this clever monitor stand and dock.<br /><br /> It will handle any VESA mount equipped monitor, offers a wide array of USB and other ports and connects to the computer with a single Type C connector.<br /><br /> It’s really docking made easy.<br /><br /> It provides mounting for dual displays and two USB 2.0 ports, two USB 3.0 ports, rear speaker output, a combo audio port and a Gigabit Ethernet port – everything you need for attaching external keyboards, mice, hard drives, speakers and so on.<br /><br /> Graphic instructions are included and assembly isn’t difficult.<br /><br /> This mount is on the large side, which is to be expected, and feels quite solid and secure.<br /><br /> I set it up for my significantly better half using a 12 inch Core M based laptop and a 24 inch Dell display.

AHMNA5UK3V66O2V3DZSBJA4FYMOA,B01F1Z7DEE,5,6,False,"I have been pondering the Microsoft Surface Pro 4 for months. It is so attractive, my aging shoulders would appreciate its light weight and the reviews have been generally positive. But it is so expensive!<br /><br /> Enter the Acer Switch Alpha 12.<br /><br /> Simply stated, I love it.<br /><br /> It has a couple of shortcomings. Battery life is shorter than I would like. And the touchpad has the potential to drive me mad.<br /><br /> But the screen is absolutely gorgeous. The 2160 x 1440 display makes the screen feel larger than its 12 inch diagonal.<br /><br /> The keyboard attaches magnetically to the tablet. Keys are responsive and typing fairly rapidly does not represent  a problem. The keyboard has a soft backlighting which makes it quite useful in dim and dark conditions.<br /><br /> The touchpad, however, may drive me mad. The size is barely okay. Left-and-right clicking, though, is a sometimes affair. This is complicated by right-clicking requiring a two-finger press. Seven touchpad gestures are recognized. I have not found them to be universally implemented or particularly reliable. But this may be an issue that requires patience and practice.<br /><br /> The kickstand adjusts to any angle within its range and is very sturdy so far. Since most of the weight Is in the tablet portion, using the unit as a laptop sitting on your leg is a tricky affair because the kickstand must be extended. This means the keyboard winds up against my belly and not overly convenient to type on. Tablet mode may  be the better option.<br /><br /> As a tablet, you would be correct in assuming the size makes it unwieldly and you’d be correct. And the weight precludes lengthy sessions of hand holding the unit. But, overall, it is a very usable tablet.<br /><br /> The unique cooling systems does a good job of dissipating heat.<br /><br /> The Intel core i3 processor is more powerful than I expected and worked well with Nuance Dragon Naturally Speaking. Word processing was trouble-free as was Skype. However video production switching quickly bogged down which probably has more to do with the onboard Intel GPU than the CPU. Video recorded with the internal camera and Microsoft Movie Maker was in sync. Microsoft Word performed very well.<br /><br /> The internal 2MP camera is extremely grainy and the 5MP rear-facing camera is okay.<br /><br /> The standard USB port coupled with the Type-C is a forward looking, very usable combination. The AC adapter is inline and has a long cord.<br /><br /> Overall, I am very impressed with the unit, though I think the i5 variant should be explored if you intend to do serious video work with the product. For routine things like video and music streaming, web browsing, email and typical word processing, the Acer Switch Alpha 12 with the i3 does the job – and it is very light and portable.<br /><br />Jerry"

The Seagate ST2000LM007 spins at 5400RPM while the present drive runs at 7200RPM. I used to think that bare statistic made a lot of difference, but having run with the 1 TB for more than a year, I am not so sure about that.<br /><br /> The Seagate has a 128MB cache, the 1 TB has only 32MB. The Seagate average seek time is 13ms: the drive it is replacing has a slightly higher seek time, although it does spin faster.<br /><br /> A big factor is going to be the applications. Over the past couple of years, there have been significant enhancements to using hyper-threading, multi-core processors and exploiting GPUs.<br /><br /> So the Seagate ST2000LM007 is indeed a thing of beauty, a technical marvel. Installation takes seconds. Throughput is okay, though I don’t ever expect to achieve the promised 6GB per second transfer rate. But my drive speed test (CrystalMark) doesn’t test the drive under real world conditions.<br /><br /> I’m just going to have to observe the processes I use and render subjective impressions. I don’t do super-demanding work, like 4K video which is another reason why I think his 5400RPM drive will work out well.<br /><br /> Over the next few weeks, I’ll be using it on a daily basis. If my results are really in the mud, I’ll amend this review, otherwise not.<br /><br /> On the whole, though, the ST2000LM007 is just a beautiful piece of work. I love it.

Problems to be solved and computations to be performed were submitted in the form of stacks of punched cards. Then came terminals and the beginning of shared computing. Then came distributed computing until we ultimately endd up with the internet.<br /><br /> The Chromebox (and Chromebook) are the current culmination of this process.<br /><br /> The Acer Chromebox CXI2-4GKM is a network computer. While a thin selection of apps which can be run locally or on the network are available, the real focus of this device is to access internet based (online) resources, particularly the Google constellation of Google Docs, Google Search, Google services and offerings, such as YouTube.<br /><br /> The device is a tiny box, measuring about 6.5 x 5 x 1.5 inches, powered by a relatively low-powered Celeron CPU with Intel HD graphics and 4GB internal RAM, couple with 16GB SSD internal storage. The specs wouldn’t fly for a Microsoft Windows install, but when all your apps are on the internet and Google Chrome Browser is your Graphical User Interface (GUI), this modest hardware is all you need.<br /><br /> Google Apps will handle nearly all your word processing, spreadsheet and presentation needs. Other Google apps such as Gmail and Calendar cover most personal and business needs. The Chromebox has sufficient power to handle all these and others such as Netflix. And, of course, there are many other online applications for more esoteric needs such as mind mapping, project management and so much more, all delivered over the internet through the Chrome browser.<br /><br /> The Chromebox is, in fact, the future or a strong harbinger of what the future will be. You can stick the Chromebox on a shelf or even mount to a monitor with a VESA bracket.<br /><br /> Connectivity could be fairly described as superb: 4 USB 3.0 ports, Gigabit Ethernet, DisplayPort, HDMI, 802.11 a/c, Bluetooth 4.0 and an SD card reader. A USB connected keyboard and mouse are in the box, but they are very basic. I would suggest replacing both with a higher quality mouse and keyboard. You also get 100GB of online storage free for two years.<br /><br /> Startup takes seconds. Literally. It’s kind of mind-blowing.<br /><br /> Performance is pretty good on Netflix, but spotty on YouTube which mirrors my experience on other computers in my environment.<br /><br /> Overall, if you don’t need a Windows box or a lot of local app flexibility, this is a great little machine. Just remember: if the ne goes down, for all practical purposes, you’re pretty much finished except for what you’ve stored locally.<br /><br />Jerry"

The prices keep coming down and the audio output quality keeps going up.<br /><br /> The WS-852 and its more expensive sibling WS-853 are little wonders of technology.<br /><br /> Both are certified to the 6 star level of compatibility with Dragon Naturally Speaking, the vest voice to text program currently available in the consumer market. (Fpr best results, use the recorder with a compatible headset.)<br /><br /> The feature set on these recorders has always intrigued me.<br /><br /> The only  feature I constantly use on older models is the scene selection, where you can choose between solo dictation, small meetings, conference room, auditorium and so on. Now, according to Olympus, you can choose an “Intelligent Auto Mode” which will set the microphone sensitivity automatically or choose one of the seven “scenes”.<br /><br /> Olympus has also introduced a “simple” display mode, which presents only those functions that are frequently used. This is a good idea that certainly reduces the confusion factor for first-time users – and old pros as well. I suspect it is a result of the competition Olympus faces from smart phones, but whatever the reason it’s a good idea.<br /><br /> A new addition is a flip-up stand, intended to reduce vibration when using the microphone on as tablet.<br /><br /> One very unwelcome change is moving the external microphone and headphone jacks to the side of the unit. This is extremely bothersome to me since I almost always have an external microphone plugged into the unit. Most often it is the Olympus ME51S Stereo Microphone which I find extremely effective for recording small meetings. Possibly the new built-in Olympus stereo microphone will do as well, but I am a bit skeptical.<br /><br /> The unit will accept a 32GB microSD card that will give you umpteen million hours of storage. The  4GB will suffice for most  people: just use the built-in USB connector to transfer your recordings to your computer.<br /><br /> Finally, bear in mind that this is intended to be a voice recorder: the frequency range is quite limited and music doesn’t come off too well. Also new is a filter that lops off the lowest and highest frequencies in a recording. It can be useful in getting rid of ambient noise.<br /><br /> Overall, for those who appreciate the versatility of a dedicated digital voice recorder, you won’t go wrong with the WS-852.<br /><br />Jerry"

It is silent.<br /><br /> I tried it on a Dell Venue 11 Pro which runs full Windows 8.1 and an Intel Atom processor. The Seagate was simply blindingly fast. Makes the Venue, when connected to its keyboard dock (or a Bluetooth keyboard) and a mouse, a full-bore system. With the Venue (156GB available internal storage), keyboard dock, Bluetooth mouse and this SSD, my Intel i7 ultra-laptop will stay home most of the time in the future. The new setup weighs in at less than 3 pounds. Amazingly, I can do simple video editing on this low-powered system and the Seagate makes that process a lot more efficient.<br /><br /> On my primary system which has all USB 3.0 ports, this thing just plugs and plays. It’s very fast here too.<br /><br /> Overall, this is a great little drive. Very high portability factor, extremely fast with USB 3.0 ports and reasonable capacity at a pretty good price, about a dollar per GB. I’ll be using this one with my Windows tablet. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for very light, small form factor, super-fast and reasonably sized and priced external storage.

In real-life terms, the images are tack-sharp. Focus range is excellent. I use the webcam for making stop-motion videos of Lego mini-figures with my grandson, where lens-to-subject distance is  mere inches; video conferencing where I may change the focus from a couple of feet to inches when I hold something up to the camera. Focus changes fast and smoothly.<br /><br /> Full 1080p and 720p video is available.<br /><br /> Right now, I am working out a system to use two of these C920s for video conferencing with one on an inexpensive webcam switching program so I can swap out a view of the screen or a second camera on a copy stand.<br /><br /> Microphone audio is excellent.<br /><br /> The Logitech software is capable and far more stable than earlier incarnations.<br /><br /> The mount works well on laptops, adapts very readily to sitting atop CRT and LCD monitors.

Finally, it will also play JPG image files.<br /><br /> The compact, but thorough manual walks you through hooking up the device with various audio encoders.<br /><br /> The front panel doesn't display a whole lot of information, but again, who really needs the surplusage offered by more expensive and pretentious units?<br /><br /> Standard functions such as enabling subtitles are available.<br /><br /> The real kicker for this unit, however, is its ""upconverting"", ""uprezzing"" or ""upscaling"" capabilities. The process, basically, is taking the existing image data and adding pixels in an intelligent way to make it look good on higher resolution devices. The Toshiba does a very good job of this. You can't, of course, get 1080i or 1080p content when it doesn't exist originally, but you can fake it well - and that's what the Toshiba does.

It is flawless. I have used it with computers running an Intel Dual Core 2.5Ghz CPU, lots of RAM and 7200RPM drives down to a Intel Pentium M running at 1.6Ghz in 1GB of RAM and a relatively slow 5400RPM hard drive.<br /><br /> The results are perfect on every machine.<br /><br /> I've run the ADVC300 using commercial software, Adobe Premiere Elements, and open source, the venerable and really capable freeware, VirtualDub.<br /><br /> Perhaps best of all, the ADVC300 has tools in its own hardware to work  a number of adjustments on the incoming signal. If your tapes are worn or poorly exposed or just old, this capability effect changes can be a lifesaver.<br /><br /> I haven't had a need to use these capabilities yet, which are by the way, controllable by Canopus supplied software.<br /><br /> The unit comes with everything you  need: the ADVC300 converter, a 6-pin to 4-wire Firewire cable and a AC power adapter. The supplied manual is on the terse side, but it does explain what you need to know. In any event, with controls like these, you're going to learn by experimentation.<br /><br /> Yes, the unit is expensive. Very expensive.

Some Bluetooth and IR keyboards provide a bit of relief in that they offer a larger keyboard, but they are typically flimsy and somewhat difficult ot deal with.<br /><br />  Enter the Atek Travel Keyboard, a very simple concept, done very well.<br /><br />  Atek provides a full-sized keyboard with a sliding protective cover and even (and perhaps unnecessarily) an inflatable wrist rest.<br /><br />  The keyboard is a delight. It weighs just under 1.5 pounds, measures about 15 x 5 x .75. The keyboard nests inside a protective hard cover, which in turn converts into a base holding the keyboard at an excellent angle for typing. There is also an easily inflatable wrist support, if you want to use. Finally there is cloth pouch to hold the assemblage.<br /><br />  The unit connects via USB.<br /><br />  Some may think the unit too large, heavy and unnecessary to carry with them. However, as soon as you have to type for more than a few minutes, you'll appreciate having the Atek Travel Keyboard nestled in your gear bag.<br /><br />  It is a delight to type on the full-sized keys. Atek made some intelligent design decisions. There are no right side Ctrl, Print Screen, Pause Break or Scroll Lock keys. Finally there is no right side Windows Start key. None of these are a significant loss - and the gain is a luxuriously sized keyboard you can comfortably type on in your motel or hotel room or on the coffee shop table. There is also, for those who need it, a full dedicated numeric keypad.<br /><br />  This keyboard is made for accurate fast typing.<br /><br />  You can see how seriously Atek took designing this keyboard by reading the short manual. It contains a short and very interesting section on why most laptop keyboards are so bad. Interesting material, indeed.<br /><br />  I don't know about you, but more than once, while on the road, I have run out to a store to buy a full-sized keyboard to use with my laptop. Usually it was because a client suddenly demanded a new document or substantial revisions of an existing document - deadline production loads that are simply not suited to the capabiltities of many laptop keyboards.<br /><br />  For the money, you can't beat this keyboard. Unless you are one of those masochists who totes a 17"" laptop around, you need to have one of these in your kit. One day you are going to have to turn out a lengthy document on your laptop with its puny bilt-in keyboard. The Atek Travel keyboard will make your work a breeze. Excellent value."

And it is that one quality that causes me to give the Aspire One only 3-stars, because the problem is one that could have been overcome through more engineering effort.<br /><br />  My hands are large, old and somewhat arthritic. The keyboard of the Acer Aspire One is thus impossible for me to type on in a noral or near normal manner with any degree of facility or speed. Just another 2 or 3 mm of keyboard width would have helped, I think. As it is, even after some serious practice, I have to slowly and deliberately stay aware of my finger placement as I try for each corret key. Hitting the wrong key, not surprisingly requires no effort.<br /><br />  The touch and feel of the keyboard is great. It is just too small for my hands.<br /><br />  Everything else about the Aspire One is top-notch.<br /><br />  The Intel Atom processor and Windows XP Home are made for each other. Startup is very fast on a cold boot and almost intantaneous from standby. Performance with one or two applications running is more than adequate - and I mean actually running, not just sitting open.<br /><br />  I tried it with [[ASIN:B001B5J7LQ Dragon NaturallySpeaking 10 Preferred]], a very demanding program, and was very surprised. Dragon worked. It ran much more slowly than it would on a more powerful machine, but it did run and speech recognition accuracy was high.<br /><br />  The 1 GB of RAM appears adequate, but like many, I would prefer the option to bump it up to 2 GB. As it is, the maximum capacity is 1.5GB and getting to the RAM is a bear.<br /><br />  The screen is a joy to behold. Marvelous clarity and tack-sharp. Photos and movies look superb. Text even at smaller sizes is easily read.<br /><br />  The two card readers are a convenience even with the 160GB hard drive. Perfect way to carry pieces of your music and video collection with synchronizing or transfer problems. Three USB ports, 3.5mm audio ports and a VGA-out port are all useful.<br /><br />  In terms of overall design, the machine is exquisite. Just the right size for toting in a large jacket pocket, passport or inflight bag or numerous other carriers. Contrary to many reports in Amazon reviews, my Aspire one was essentially noise-free and WiFi range was more than satisfactory.<br /><br />  Likewise, the arrangment of the touchpad with its vertical buttons at the side caused no operational problems.<br /><br />  The battery is fantastic. Five hours easy with normal activities. Carry a spare and you're ready for as long day at the airport waiting and a long flight.<br /><br />  No built-in Bluetooth, which I consider a curious omission, but a $20 dollar adapter takes care of that.<br /><br />  Overall, the Acer Aspire One is a terrific computer, truly meriting 5-stars on engineering and technological bases.

This is, frankly, unexpected at this price and in this brand. Start-up and shot-to-shot recycling times are still on the slightly slow side. Expect to miss a lot of critical moments as you would with any other point 'n shooter. The camera is a bit on the heavy side, though this is consistent with the build quality (I think) and the use of AA batteries. On the whole, not a long list and nothing serious.<br /><br />  On the plus side, there several features I consider outstanding and unique. The video quality (with stereo microphones) is nothing less than astounding. A friend of mine has been making videos for YouTube of music club performances, handheld with harsh club lighting and they are surprisingly good. I have been very impressed with the videos I've made under a variety of conditions. I suspect many people like having a video capability in their still camera. I know I do and appreciate that I don't have to carry a separate device. The zoom range is terrific, the Image Stabilization (IS) works while in video mode, which is very welcome and very important and you can zoom while in video mode. All in all, if you appreciate having a video capability, a good reason to buy the camera.<br /><br />  The Canon LCD display can be set in many positions, with its unique hinging system. You can hold the camera overhead or ground level. You can flip it over for use as a monitor when doing photos or videos of yourself. (A particularly handy gadget to use when you're on vacation or otherwise want to include yourself in images is the [[ASIN:B000V244U4 Quik Pod Pro-Plus Extendable Handheld Tripod (18-inch) with Accessory Kit - for Canon Powershot, Casio, Epson, Fuji Finepix, HP, Kodak Easyshare, Minolta, Nikon Coolpix, Olympus Stylus, Panasonic, Pentax Optio & Sony Cybershot Digital Point & Shoot Cameras]].) There is also an optical viewfinder. I find this combination in many Canon cameras an unbeatable feature.<br /><br />  There is, unusually for a camera of this class, a hotshoe for external flashes. Adding an external flash will provide tremendous improvement to the range and versatility of your camera in almost all photographic situations. Ever wonder why the pros always use and external flash? It's because it helps them turn out better photos. Even a low power external flash will work wonders and the S5 is one of the few cameras in this range to permit you to use one.<br /><br />  The S5 uses AA batteries. Many will argue that this is an old-fashioned approach. Not me. On too many occasions (one is actually one too many), I have had run out of juice with lithium ion battery powered cameras. Nothing is more frustrating then a camera that is without power. AA batteries are available worldwide, are relatively inexpensive and relatively lightweight. Again, I consider the use of AA batteries in the S5 to be an advantage and a reason to buy the camera. A set will last for 150 -200 shots.<br /><br />  In terms of general features, image quality is excellent, with ISO available up to 1600. Noise starts at ISO 100 and becomes progressively worse at higher ISOs. This is normal for this kind of camera.<br /><br />  Color rendition is excellent. I haven't yet notice any purple fringing which is relatively common in cameras of this kind.<br /><br />  There are more than 20 pre-set shooting parameters, more frankly than you will ever be likely to use or even remember. There is - bless Canon - full manual control available. This is a real camera!<br /><br />  The controls are well laid out and, even with my large hands, I had no difficulty manipulating any of the controls. Menus are intelligently done and easy to navigate. There is a separate button for video which is a nice, but necessary, touch.<br /><br />  Focus at all ranges is pretty quick, though I have encountered some occasional hunting.<br /><br />  Lens range is typical for a 12x. Be nicer if the bottom end were the equivalent of a 28mm, not 35mm.<br /><br />  There is competition in this price and feature range. Panasonic offers the Lumix FZ18 which offers an 18x zoom with a 28mm equivalent bottom range. It is worth considering, but lacks the Canon swivel display and video zoom capabilities.<br /><br />  Overall the Canon S5 is an undeniably fine camera for its price range. It is absolutely not a DSLR and anyone wanting the feel of a traditional 35mm SLR and the ability to grab instant pictures should seriously consider spending far more and buying a DSLR. Within its limitations, however, the Canon S5, in my opinion, sits at the top of its class and should be seriously considered.<br /><br />Jerry"
AHMNA5UK3V66O2V3DZSBJA4FYMOA,B000RUPEOA,4,6,True,"Like so many others, I am on a perpeptual search for the ""perfect"" Bluetooth headset. I want it to slip over my ear quickly, to fit firmly into my ear canal, allow me to hear clearly while I am standing in the midst of a roaring crowd and reproduce my voice perfectly no matter how lousy my connection.<br /><br />  Someone on  quest like this encounters a lot of disappointment.<br /><br />  The Jabra 510 met some of these requirements, but not the critical ones. Hearing the other party often required pressing it into my ear and I often received complaints that I was difficult to hear.<br /><br />  Many reviews on the Jawbone have been glowing . . . and some have been downright derogatory. I figured that I might as well try it.<br /><br />  The design is visually appealing, but the earband is a piece of bad design. Apparently made of aluminum or some metal alloy, it is relatively inflexible and difficult to place over the ear. One point against. There have also been reports that these earloops are easy to break.<br /><br />  There are only two buttons, both of which are hidden. One is relatively easy to find, the other requires a bit of hunting. This second button is also the volume control. Press it a bit too long and you've just turned off Bluetooth and lost your call.<br /><br />  The visual indicators for status are sparse, so often you are left guessing as to precisely what status your Jawbone is in. I found that restablishing my Bluetooth connection, which I had accidentally severed, was way more difficult than it had to be.<br /><br />  Initial pairing was flawlessly simple, but if you lose your connection while driving on an expressway, for example, trying to reconnect turns you into an accident waiting to happen.<br /><br />  Received audio quality is pretty good. Using the standard ear bud, the fit was good, but not perfect. The volume control proved to be hit-or-miss. Sometimes pressing it as the directions specified increased the volume. Sometimes it broke my Bluetooth connection.<br /><br />  I tested the voice transmission capability by turning up the television and radio at the same time and calling my own voicemail. I must tell you, the noise cancelling technology works very well. Voice quality is acceptable: we're talking cell phone audio here, not concert hall acoustics.<br /><br />  The battery seems to last the specified times, but the proprietary charger connections are not only a bad idea, but stupid as well. While one end of the cable can be plugged into a standard USB slot, the end that attaches to the Jawbone is proprietary. This is just plain dumb. It should be a mini-USB. Instead you have to remember to pack yet one more cable.<br /><br />  Is the Jawbone worth the premium price? Kind of doubtful. With other headsets, I've never been unable to complete a phone call, although sometimes I have had a hard time hearing and being understood. The Jawbone does make your voice more intelligible with its noise cancelling abilities. So I guess the determination would be how often you would need to depend on that noise cancelling technology. I am also wary of Aliph's customer support. Many Amazon reviews have remarked on poor build quality, breakage and very poor customer support by the manufacturer.<br /><br />Jerry"
AHMNA5UK3V66O2V3DZSBJA4FYMOA,B000V1MLBE,5,590,True,"I'd love to do a video review of the Flip Video Ultra, but there's so much detail to be covered, I think the video format might get boring.<br /><br />  First, the Flip Video Ultra is in a class all its own. It is purely a highly portable video recorder for casual use. It will not replace your $12,000 Sony prosumer model or even your $800 Sony, Canon or Pansonic.<br /><br />  Rather the Flip Video Ultra is an extremely portable unit, measuring about 2.25 inches across by 4 inches high and a bit more than an inch thick. Powered by two AA cells, it can record 60 minutes or - surprise - more of  video. In my experiments, I recorded almost 2 hours of video on a Flip Video Ultra. There's no big secret here: if what you are recording has relatively little movement, you can stretch your recording time. Thus, for recording lectures of your version of ""My Dinner With Andre"", the Flip might work out better than you planned.<br /><br />  The 640 x 480 VGA video is surprisingly good. Not theatrical quality sharpness, but far better than your cell phone camera will produce. Action is recorded smoothly with little, if any, artifacting. Exposure capability is excellent. I tried it on scenes ranging from a brightly lit sunny outdoor street with wide contrasts to a dark highway lit only by passing cars. Good detail under all conditions with little blocking. Quite surprising, really.<br /><br />  Incidentally, another reviewer complained that the lens could be easily scratched. That's not true. The actual lens is recessed and protected by either a glass or plastic cover. So far, it shows no susceptibility to being easily scratched. If it is, it appears to held in place by a metal fitting. Whether that permit user replacement, I don't know, but should the lens cover become damaged, I am sure it could be replaced.<br /><br />  The unit has what appears to be about a 2x digital zoom, which is a nice touch.<br /><br />  The Flip Video Ultra is a very nice piece of design. The battery compartment latch is on the bottom and is highly resistant to accidental opening. There's also a tripod socket on the bottom. It is mounted off-center, which I consider unfortunate because this camera would be a perfect fit for the [[ASIN:B000NPCI9I Quik Pod Pro+ with All Accessories Including Tripod Legs]], a handheld camera mount that allows you to include yourself and a companion or two in your own videos. It's really a very clever gadget, but the off-center tripod mount on the Flip makes it a tiny bit difficult to use.<br /><br />  From the back, on the right side, is a sliding switch to power the unit on and off. Again, the switch is very well designed and very difficult to trip accidentally.<br /><br />  On the back of the Flip is a 1.5"" transflective screen that you can see even in quite bright daylight. It is more than sufficient for casual videomaking. There's a 4-way rocker switch under the viewfinder. This four way has a big red button in the middle that controls recording. It is on the difficult side to use, requiring you to use a fingernail to depress it to stop and start recording. They obviously made it this way to prevent accidental starting and stopping, but they did their job too well. It's a bit of hassle to cleanly start and stop recording. But at least you won't be making any accidental recordings with this unit. The rocker switch is multi-purpose.  Playback volume is controlled from here as is the digital zoom and, in playback mode, moving from one clip to another. There's a play button to the left of the 4-way and a delete button to the right. Couldn't be simpler. My only complaint is that the recording start and stop function isn't as snappy as it could be.<br /><br />  Response time of the unit is excellent. Once you do get that pesky start button pressed, the unit begins recording almost instantly. Audio quality, by the way, is excellent. The built-in microphone is sensitive and nearby voices are recorded without distortion.<br /><br />  Some people fail to see the utility in the Flip Video Ultra, pointing out that their digital cameras also have video. Yes, many do. But few offer the capability of recording an hour or more of 640x480 video at one time. Most can't hold an hour of video on a single card. And few are as small and compact as the Flip Video Ultra. So the comparison of the flip with digital still cameras doesn't fly.<br /><br />  The Flip is the kind of thing you can carry with you all the time and whip into action reasonably quickly (but thanks to that pesky record switch, not quickly enough) to capture some cute thing the kids are doing or something that is going on around you. Bloggers, blossoming independent journalists and artists of many kinds will love the Flip. Parents who are into recording their kids' cute moments will also love it. And, frankly, it's a nice thing to pop in your pocket when you're travelling. The Flip is one of those rare gadgets that can appeal to many different kinds of people for many different reasons.<br /><br />  The real beauty of the Flip is in getting the video off the camera and onto a computer.<br /><br />  Just plug it into a USB port.<br /><br />  That's it.<br /><br />  The USB connector flips up from the Flip.<br /><br />  Truly slick design, reflective of very innovative thinking.<br /><br />  Plugging it in brings up an idiot proof interface for getting the video onto your computer. (There's an option to save it to DVD through authorized dealers which I did not try.) It's  two-step process to transfer. Simplicity personified.<br /><br />  Flip also includes a trial version of Muvee Autoproducer which can more or less edit your video clips into a presentable format by applying machine intelligence. It works, sort of, and for many people may be all they need or want. Be forewarned: there's a sales message included that promises you 20% off the full version of Muvee Autoproducer. But guess what? The ""special deal"" gets you Version 5 of the product, not the currently shipping Version 6 to which you can upgrade for $39.95 more. Guess what? That brings you to the full suggested retail price of the current product. This kind of ""special offer"" has an unsavory aroma to it. I've written to both Pure Digital, makers of the Flip, and Muvee to see if this is just an unfortunate mistake (i.e., the offer was embedded in the software before the new version came out) or is just a plain attempt at a rip-off. Should you be attracted to the ""special offer"" on the Muvee software, I suggest you check it out for yourself.<br /><br />  I'm obviously a quick convert to the Flip. I think it's a great gadget and a more than adequate substitute for heavier equipment in appropriate situations. I've been thinking of doing some video blogging for a project that requires one-on-one interviews. I can see buying another one or two Flip Video Ultras, some lightweight [[ASIN:B000J43MMA 4-SECTION Tripod with Grounder]]and with a portable light or two, having a more than adequate two or three camera setup. The quality would be more than adequate for web distribution and, depending on circumstances, even for DVD distribution to a business audience.<br /><br />  I am obviously impressed by the Flip Video Ultra. It has not only a very high cool factor, but a very high utility factor as well.<br /><br />Jerry"
AHMNA5UK3V66O2V3DZSBJA4FYMOA,B000K3JRN8,4,23,False,"The truly portable computer has been a long dreamt of concept. Way back when, the Compaq - which was heavy enough to stretch your arm if you had to carry it any distance - was the cat's meow. Then the Osborne, the GRiD, the Apple Newton and dozens of othe contenders.<br /><br />  Microsoft is trying to ignite the category with its UMPC (Ultra Mobile Personal Computer) specification. The firat contender was Samsung with its Q1 which did not receive generally favorable reviews. Now Asus, with much anticipation, has debuted its R2H model.<br /><br />  Beautifully designed, it is sadly underpowered, which does not make it unusable: it simply means that this is a machine only a geek will truly love. I'll be explaining the reasons why.<br /><br />  The physical design is nothing short of exquisite. A brushed aluminum face with a plastic body. Mouse and navigation buttons are artful slotted tabs. The thumbstick is positioned very niced on the right side and the navigation pad on the left. Much thought obviously went into the placement of the controls, because they fall naturally, perfectly under the thumb. As a handheld, this slightly more than 2 pound unit requires two hands for exercising full control. A wrist strap is a necessity if you want security instead of a thousand dollar accident at your feet. Oddly, Asus does not provide a wriststrap or lanyard, though they do provide some other nice accessories.<br /><br />  The 7"" screen is very nice, sharp and crisp. Like most screens, it is unusable in direct sunlight, which of course sharply reduces the utilty of this or any other portable computer outdoors. Standard resolution is 800 x 468, which is the Microsoft spec. The Intel 945 chipset, however, allows you resolutions up to 1024 x 768. You have to scroll to see the full screen. Microsoft's ClearType technology renders even icon text clearly and sharply, so using this small screen is not a problem.<br /><br />  Microsoft Windows XP Tablet Edition is a joy to use. Handwriting recognition is awesome. Even my scrawl is largely recognized. This is not an active touchscreen, so you will get vectoring if you're not careful.<br /><br />  Asus chose to use the Intel Celeron M 900 Mhz CPU. Very marginal choice. Don't expect to do much multitasking on this machine. It is on the slow side at its very best: not unusably slow, but slow like an old 386 or 486. The very first thing you have to do with this unit is to rip out every bit of bloatware that Asus and Microsoft launch. Delivered, the machine has 768 MB of RAM. 256 is soldered and the 512 SODIMM can be replaced with a 1 GB stick: do it. You're going to need as much free RAM as you can get to run at peak efficiency.<br /><br />  The good news is that you can run most applications flawlessly. The 60 GB 4200 RPM 1.7"" form factor isn't terribly pokey. Asus provides a thumb typing utility called DialKeys which isn't bad, but downloading and using Mobience's SoKey utility srikes me as a better option.<br /><br />  Handwriting recognition, as noted, is excellent. There's a pop-up QWERTY keypad as well. Taken with DialKeys or SoKey, there's no shortage of manual input mechanisms and all of them work well for limited amounts of textual input. For anything more than that, you'll want to hook up a standard USB, Bluetooth or wireless keyboard and mouse. I used all three without difficulty.<br /><br />  With a regular mouse and keyboard attached, you have yourself a tiny little computer that can definitely get the job done. Yes, an ultra portable laptop will suffice as well, but then you lose the handheld tablet capability. Also, the Asus is less expensive than most extremely lightweight laptops.<br /><br />  The unit has three USB ports, a video out port that seems to use an iPod like cable and ports for headphones and microphone. The speaker is adequate, but sound through the headphone port will knock your socks off.<br /><br />  The unit has a 1.3 M webcam and a surprisingly good onboard microphone.<br /><br />  Bluetooth and 802.11g WiFi are provided. The WiFi reception is on the weak side. Only 30 or so feet from my accesspoint with the R2H and I am losing my signal. None of my other devices are that insensitive. Asus also includes a very neat driverless USB transfer cable.<br /><br />  There's also a GPS that works quite well. I was able to secure four satellites from inside several feet away from any windows. Excellent performance. However there are few convenient ways to mount the R2H in a vehicle, so without a co-pilot, you're not going to be dointg any navigating with this unit.<br /><br />  Overall, the R2H truly rocks - if you are a geek and don't mind going through the trouble of stripping out all the bloatware and can live with the slowness of the processor and hard drive. Beyond that, there's nothing bad I can say about the device. It's a 2 pound handheld Windows computer that can do just about any reasonable task you ask of it, whether it is serving as a Skype or IM videophone, writing a document in Word or OpenOffice, listening to music or an audiobook or watching a movie. Truly a form of geek heaven. Battery life is unpleasantly short, about three hours from the larger six-cell LION battery, so make sure you carry a spare, an external battery or your AC adapter.<br /><br />  For travel or just hanging out at the internet cafe, this unit is a delight. I knock off a star simply because the CPU is so slow and Asus load so much performance-crippling bloatware on it. I don't think the average user would care for this unit: but geeks will definitely groove on it.<br /><br />Jerry"
AF2LFSDT2SHRD2WEEC3O2ZWIWYEQ,B07R8WK8VP,4,3,False,"My first home desktop was a 1995 IBM Aptiva. It had an Intel Pentium processor with the cheetah speed of 475 MHz, floppy disk and a dial-up modem to connect to AOL. It came in at a cool $1999 and I was the coolest kid on the block because I could download a song from Napster in only 12-20 minutes!<br /><br />Flash forward a billion years in computer time. No one uses desktops anymore and even laptops are a bit provincial and quaint to the digital-native, gen-Z kids.

This one lives in the family room where it can be used to back up, store and organize all your phone’s videos and pics, create documents, manage your finances and, of course, be used for gaming.<br /><br />It doesn’t have the best video graphics card, but I give it a 4 out of 5 so that’s pretty good at this price point."
AEPI3J4HMIHUUNP4K54H5SV7EGZQ,B00MEW1YRA,4,3,False,"I don't own this product but own another QNAP NAS, but have studied this product to provide further comment.<br /><br />Note, that Windows does not allow one to run a virtual machine of an already activated Windows PC. For example, one can create a virtual machines of one's PC and then run it as a virtual machine on the same computer to test new software. Microsoft does not allow that unless one buys a 2nd windows license. The same applies moving the virtual machine to the QNAP NAS. You will have to pay another ~$200 or so for WIN 8.1 to do that legally.<br /><br />The 853 QNAP is relatively expensive as it is a premium NAS given its relatively powerful Celeron processor that only consumes 10W. What I like to see from QNAP is encryption without performance loss in a mid-range product. This generally requires hardware-based encryption or an AES-NI Intel capable processor. Essentially none (or a few) of the QNAP or Synology systems have it today. Hopefully, that will change in the future. The QNAP 853 (Intel 1900J Celeron) processor does not support AES-NI encryption. That's why one has to give up at least 30% in performance when encryption is enabled as encryption is software based while for AES-NI processors that will be done by the processor directly which is more efficient.<br /><br />I own a QNAP 459pro+ since 2011 which has been rock solid. I recently switched (Dec, 2014) to encrypt my drives. Performance with encryption is much worse as the 459pro+ Atom processor cannot compete with the newer Celeron processor (50-70% performance loss vs 30% for Celeron). I am holding out for most NASs to support encryption will little performance penalty. That's when I buy my next NAS."

AGXF2GE4YOHMZFPVOJAMCFLXJXNA,B004KKZ0H4,5,258,False,"I purchased this camera (in black) a few weeks ago with the Lowepro Ridge30 case [[ASIN:B000BH1GFK Lowepro Ridge 30 Camera Case (Black)]] and Transcend 8GB Class 10 SDHC card [[ASIN:B003VNKNEG Transcend 8 GB Class 10 SDHC Flash Memory Card TS8GSDHC10E]]. I was tired of my old cameras not getting the right shot because they were never fast enough. That was my main criteria for purchasing this camera. After UPS dropped off the camera on a Friday, I took the kids to the park to see what it could do. The camera's ability to capture fast action shots is amazing. Kids coming down slides, crossing the monkey bars, or spinning on the merry-go-round...this captured them all crystal clear. Keep in mind, I did have to do some experimental shots first, but on fast action, set it to sports mode and fire away. Saturday was off to an outdoor Graduation. Again, the colors, ease of use, and quality of the shots was better than I was expecting. Sunday, we were off to the amusement park. I wore cargo shorts and the camera was in the side pocket all day wrapped in a napkin in a ziplock bag to protect it from rain and water rides. It took abuse from roller coasters to bumper cars. This is where I was stunned by the photos. I was able to take pictures of the kids on the roller coasters with their screaming, eyes wide open, hair blown back, ""I'm going to kill you dad for making me ride this"" expressions. See my pictures in the zs8-black photo's. BEAS62 has included some photos of closeups and the quality of the zoom. I have taken similar photos and had the same results. In my opinion, this is a great everyday-general use camera. As for the battery, I took 300 pictures between two weekends before it went to 'low battery'. Most shots (80%) were outdoor with no flash and most shots were turning the camera on and off to take 1-5 shots at a time.<br /><br />When I began this journey of trying to find a camera to take fast action shots, I was in the mindset that only a DSLR could achieve this. I have had, and used many others, in the past and have been let down. Finally I accepted that nothing was going to take these action shots without shelling out $800+. But I don't want to shell out that much, not now at least. Besides, I want a camera small enough to throw in my pocket during trips/events and not have it hanging from my neck shouting ""tourist"". The reviews on Amazon were not enough alone to convince me. The negative reviews, I felt, were lacking more detail. Some, I get it, you dropped the camera and panasonic wont fix it so now you bash them here. After weeding out the bashing, reading professional reviews on other sites, I had it narrowed down. I did have a spending limit of $250. What sold me was others recommending this one for the fast action shots, however, several of those reviewers did comment on poor low light pictures being grainy. Most of my pictures are outdoors or indoors with good lighting. I have taken several indoor photos and played with some of the scene modes. Quality indoor photos can be taken when the right scene mode is used. Auto mode does not always take the best picture. Use the different scenes for the appropriate picture. I feel many reviews are based on this Automatic picture setting. No camera I have seen will take the best pictures in Auto mode. This is not a $50 film camera of yesteryear. These are advanced electronics, the other modes are there because they take the best shots. Auto mode is there for those who don't want to stray away from the basics. Those folks are the ones who should not gripe. Mom...Dad...Grandpa...Grandma...I understand technology is too much for you, but if you are not willing to use the features as they are available or intended, don't review it based on your lack of fully testing the product. I may have passed up several better cameras because the ratings were by less-than-amateur users. I digress.<br /><br />What I like about the camera:<br /><br />  1.  24mm ultra-wide angle lens. No more backing up to get everything in the picture.<br />  2.  12 element in 10 groups Leica lens. Well known high quality lens.<br />  3.  16x optical zoom. This baby zooms and zooms. Equivalent to 24-384mm lens<br />  4.  Intelligent Scene Selector sets the scene automatically. Played with a little and should be useful.<br />  5.  Auto focus subject tracking detection. No need to keep pressing shutter button half-way to readjust focus. This helps  with the kids and fast action shots.<br />  6.  Optical image stabilization, not electronic...keeps the quality of the picture during shaking.<br />  7.  2 speed zoom, fast or slow depending on how fast you swivel the lever.<br />  8.  720p HD motion video. Not the best, Its not 1080p but only blu-ray and some camcorders are. 720p is what your local  NBC/ABC/CBS networks broadcast.<br />  9.  Face recognition. great for finding photos on your computer.<br />  10. The buttons and menu. Easy to navigate and menu buttons have ""teeth"" so you know what/where you are pressing.<br />  11. Instant on. From pressing power to 1st shot is like 1-2 seconds. Once the lens motors out, its ready. No waiting.<br /><br />What I don't like about the camera:<br />  1.  Battery. Its a proprietary battery and needs to have the microchip. There are generics, but if it doesn't have the microchip to talk to the camera, the camera wont turn on. Beware on buying generic batteries.<br />  2.  No viewfinder. Hard to see the lcd in direct sunlight, but then so is my smartphone and laptop. Not that big of a deal, as shots with direct full sun on screen are rare for me.<br /><br />When purchasing, I would recommend the Class 10 SDHC cards from a reputable company. Panasonic recommends at least a Class 6. For a few bucks more, get the Class 10. I have yet to wait for the the camera to 'write to disk' before taking the next shot. It is also fast enough for HD video, again, no waiting or buffering/glitching. As for cases, watch the sizes. I originally ordered the Lowepro Ridge 10 because the dimensions said it would fit. It didn't. I went to my local target and they had the ridge series. The 30 fits it with a little wiggle room to spare. The 20 would be too snug and risk breaking the zipper. The ridge 30 has a zipper for the camera, a flap and pouch that fit the charger (but barely, and I would not walk around with it in...just a good place to store it when it sits in the closet), and a zipper on the flap for an extra memory card or battery. Comes with shoulder strap and closed belt loop.<br /><br />...more to come, I will update the zs8-black"

Some, I get it, you dropped the camera and panasonic wont fix it so now you bash them here. After weeding out the bashing, reading professional reviews on other sites, I had it narrowed down. I did have a spending limit of $250. What sold me was others recommending this one for the fast action shots, however, several of those reviewers did comment on poor low light pictures being grainy. Most of my pictures are outdoors or indoors with good lighting. I have taken several indoor photos and played with some of the scene modes. Quality indoor photos can be taken when the right scene mode is used. Auto mode does not always take the best picture. Use the different scenes for the appropriate picture. I feel many reviews are based on this Automatic picture setting. No camera I have seen will take the best pictures in Auto mode. This is not a $50 film camera of yesteryear. These are advanced electronics, the other modes are there because they take the best shots. Auto mode is there for those who don't want to stray away from the basics. Those folks are the ones who should not gripe. Mom...Dad...Grandpa...Grandma...I understand technology is too much for you, but if you are not willing to use the features as they are available or intended, don't review it based on your lack of fully testing the product. I may have passed up several better cameras because the ratings were by less-than-amateur users. I digress.<br /><br />What I like about the camera:<br /><br />  1.  24mm ultra-wide angle lens. No more backing up to get everything in the picture.<br />  2.  12 element in 10 groups Leica lens. Well known high quality lens.<br />  3.  16x optical zoom. This baby zooms and zooms. Equivalent to 24-384mm lens<br />  4.  Intelligent Scene Selector sets the scene automatically. Played with a little and should be useful.<br />  5.  Auto focus subject tracking detection. No need to keep pressing shutter button half-way to readjust focus. This helps  with the kids and fast action shots.<br />  6.  Optical image stabilization, not electronic...keeps the quality of the picture during shaking.<br />  7.  2 speed zoom, fast or slow depending on how fast you swivel the lever.<br />  8.  720p HD motion video. Not the best, Its not 1080p but only blu-ray and some camcorders are. 720p is what your local  NBC/ABC/CBS networks broadcast.<br />  9.  Face recognition. great for finding photos on your computer.<br />  10. The buttons and menu. Easy to navigate and menu buttons have ""teeth"" so you know what/where you are pressing.<br />  11. Instant on. From pressing power to 1st shot is like 1-2 seconds. Once the lens motors out, its ready. No waiting.<br /><br />What I don't like about the camera:<br />  1.  Battery. Its a proprietary battery and needs to have the microchip. There are generics, but if it doesn't have the microchip to talk to the camera, the camera wont turn on. Beware on buying generic batteries. Few will work, and panasonic charges an arm and a leg.<br />  2.  No viewfinder. Hard to see the lcd in direct sunlight, but then so is my smartphone and laptop. Not that big of a deal, as shots with direct full sun on screen are rare for me.<br /><br />When purchasing, I would recommend the Class 10 SDHC cards from a reputable company. Panasonic recommends at least a Class 6. For a few bucks more, get the Class 10. I have yet to wait for the the camera to 'write to disk' before taking the next shot. It is also fast enough for HD video, again, no waiting or buffering/glitching. As for cases, watch the sizes. I originally ordered the Lowepro Ridge 10 because the dimensions said it would fit. It didn't. I went to my local target and they had the ridge series. The 30 fits it with a little wiggle room to spare. The 20 would be too snug and risk breaking the zipper. The ridge 30 has a zipper for the camera, a flap and pouch that fit the charger (but barely, and I would not walk around with it in...just a good place to store it when it sits in the closet), and a zipper on the flap for an extra memory card or battery. Comes with shoulder strap and closed belt loop.<br /><br />...more to come."
AH3K75XVHA3I54SRUHZL3XA3Z5PA,B00SGE7E56,4,3,True,"Edit 9/7/15: I'm updating my review from two stars to four stars because the CPU slowness was because it was doing an Windows Update check that doesn't show up using the default Task Manager settings, and I did get used to the off-center trackpad. Not a bad computer for the price if you're okay with the larger size, and it has Windows 7 too (Home only though), which is a plus.<br /><br />First, Microsoft really screwed things up with Windows 10:<br /><br />You need the latest BIOS update (1.17) from the Lenovo web site or the Windows 10 upgrade will brick your system. 1.12 (Feb 2015) was installed on my system. I was in an unbootable state -- stuck at blue Windows logo -- and even booting a Windows 7 ISO I downloaded from the Microsoft site was stuck in the same place. Wasn't able to boot the Windows 7 recovery partition anymore either (choosing it will boot and hang on Windows 10 again).<br /><br />After burning the BIOS update to CD and updating the computer, the Windows 10 install finished, and I was able then to boot the recovery partition and restore the Windows 7 image. It's still working fine right now.<br /><br />Software aside, it may take a couple weeks to get used to the trackpad on the left side of the computer (centered on the main part of the keyboard). If you do an Internet search for &#34;1569 amd a6-7000&#34; (1569 is the score), you'll see the performance is very low compared to Intel processors. You're also paying (not much) for an average to below average matte screen. I originally wrote that the system was really slow -- it wasn't, it was because the system was doing a Windows Update check with uses up all the CPU, and Task Manager hides that normally."
AH3K75XVHA3I54SRUHZL3XA3Z5PA,B002Q8HNFO,4,51,False,"(Re-wrote this review 12/6/09)<br /><br />This is an excellent budget notebook with a 15.6"" screen that's only 5.8 lbs.  We just bought two for my wife's parents (don't buy it for 3D games, as it has integrated graphics, but office apps and browsing are fine).<br /><br />Pros:<br />- T6600 Core 2 Duo (not the Pentium Dual Core, lower-end C2D, ULVs, or Atoms)<br />- Relatively quiet and light (5.8 lbs)<br />- Big hard drive (mine had a Seagate Momentus 5400.6)<br />- Screen has relatively good viewing angles, horizontal and vertical<br />- Pretty good fit and finish for a plastic casing (although there's a somewhat flimsy lid that is separate from the battery)<br />- 4 USB ports<br />- VGA output is crisp (to 1280x1024, didn't try bigger)<br />- I haven't noticed the palm rest getting warm at all ... but you're not playing 3D games are you?<br />- You can select one language during boot up that's set forever, that is, until you restore from the recovery partition.  The first time I chose Traditional Chinese.  Works great.  I restored (press F9 at boot) and selected English.  Works great, didn't need to put in DVDs, and all the software reappeared.  I even choose the option to use one C:\ drive, instead of the default 60% C:, 40% D:.<br />- Opening the notebook casing is easy -- find the ""electronic - hardware"" version (not the ""hardware"" version) of the manual on Asus's web site (search for K50, then click Download, then Manuals).  The hard drive is easily replaceable.  Relatively clean layout so I can imagine blowing out dust bunnies will be easy.<br />- Includes Office Home & Student 2007 (Word/Excel/PowerPoint/OneNote) pre-installed WITHOUT a product key.  It asks for that so I assume you just punch one in and everything's great.<br />- Includes a trial of Trend Micro Internet Security for antivirus protection pre-installed.<br />- Aside from the Asus utilities, relatively little bloatware<br />- Turned off all of Win7's eye candy.  Don't need that.<br />- 1-year international warranty.  Includes accident protection (register for this within 60 days on the Asus U.S. web site, and it's non-transferrable from the original owner).  No paperwork on extending the warranty.  We're trying our luck in case the computer breaks down in &lt; 1 year and they give us a hassle about it being a gift and the warranty being valid.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- A bit fat<br />- The screen has a blue tinge, just like with Asus's TN LCD displays.  You get used to it though.<br />- Glossy screen (reflections), not matte<br />- Two-finger touchpad scrolling is too sensitive out of the box with Firefox (although it might be okay with IE).  Turning it all the way down, it's fine.<br />- The numeric keypad uses smaller keys!  Difficult to use for folks with big hands.<br />- The arrow keys don't have space around them (and actually the right arrow key is bumped into the numeric keypad section), so you need to learn where they are.<br />- The keyboard and touchpad are on the left side of the computer because of the numeric keypad.  You quickly get used to that, though, so no biggie.<br />- The touchpad buttons require some pressure to click, but you get used to it.<br />- 4 GB maximum memory.  Just 1 user-accessible memory slot which contains 2GB.  No biggie.<br />- No DVI.  No port replicator option with that option.<br />- No Bluetooth, FireWire, eSATA, ExpressCard/PCI Express slot<br />- Integrated Intel graphics (not for 3D gaming, but great for 2D apps)<br />- The T6600 doesn't support Windows 7's XP compatibility mode.  Most of the Win7 Home Premium notebooks I've seen have a CPU which doesn't support XP mode.  Only Win7 Professional and higher supports VT mode anyway.  Does XP mode matter at all?  I have no idea.  Search the Internet for that.<br />- It doesn't wake up when you open the lid.  It does sleep when you close the lid.  Yes, I checked the settings.  Tip:  Change the close-lid behavior to Sleep instead of Hibernate for a faster sleep, but battery will drain faster.<br /><br />Edit 12/10/09:<br /><br />A few cons I've noticed:<br />- The two speakers are on the bottom of the notebook, at the front lip.  You really need a hard surface to reflect the sound up to you.  Definitely below average compared with other notebooks IMO.<br />- The Page Up / Down keys are above the numeric keypad -- way out of reach.  It's an incredible hassle with Internet browsing.<br />- Remember how I wrote the graphics are good enough for 2D?  If you watch a Yahoo! music video in full screen mode, that sucker will tear during fast motion.  It's fine at the normal zoom level and with computers with discrete graphics.<br />- I'm always accidentally hitting the DVD eject button.  Other notebooks I've used recess this button."

The camera pans in and out based on people’s position in the room, which means little kids are mostly in the picture. But the audio is terrible, no matter what kind of tv or sound bar you have.

AFS2RNKSVRFSDLOCCGV7TUYSW5JQ,B0764WCXCV,5,0,True,So my wife’s 3 year old laptop has been grinding to a halt. It was an Intel i5 with 8gb of Ram so it had respectable specs for a general home use laptop still. The bottleneck was a 5400 rpm drive that hasn’t been wiped and reloaded since purchased new. I purchased this to try to give the computer another year or 2 of use.<br /><br />After doing a backup and the install (5 minutes flat on her Dell Inspiron) I reloaded Windows and once the install was finished the computer booted in mere seconds!

After some analysis I determine the differences between the two was minimal so I took the price adjustment.  This turned out to be a great deal.  I installed it in an external docking station, formatted, and used Carbon Copy Cloner to transfer all my stuff and it worked great.  The speeds are lower than advertised.  I got write at 400 and read at 434 but still very fast.  Now the reliability testing starts.  I will update this review later if any issue comes up.  I gave it 4 stars do to lower speeds than advertised.

I just upgraded from an old Dell with a quad core, with Windows 8.1 I can turn the thing on (not from standby or hibernate) and be up and running before my printer is ready to scan, averaging about 20 second boot time.

AHZZCVEZFC6S2ZU7ISXXFHRJIKMA,B001P06Q5C,2,4,True,"I really want to give this camera a positive review, but I just can't bring myself to do it.  Over the three weeks of use this camera saw (ranging from backpacking trips to picnics) I took some really awesome shots.  However, in the end I just couldn't justify keeping it when it seemed to get all the basics wrong.  I am not a photography expert.  I don't know what aperture means and if you start talking about spot metering you're likely to lose my attention to something shiny.  Of course, those things are the reason that I purchased a point-and-shoot camera in the first place.  I read some of the early reviews (this camera premiered in April 09) and thought I had found a camera to fit my very active outdoor lifestyle.  A friend has the 790 SW and I really liked it, but it seems they made some mistakes when upgrading.<br /><br />When I first started taking pictures with it I thought maybe it was my own doing.  I, admittedly, don't know what I'm doing so I thought maybe I'd set some funky settings.  However, simply putting it on ""iAuto"" and focusing/shooting resulted in photos that only seemed good if the person(s) in them was standing completely still.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt though and tried it a few more times.  Unfortunately the result was consistent. I was throwing out 3/4s of the pictures I was taking.  Those numbers are unacceptable when some of the places you go take days of hiking to get to.  For an example of what I'm talking about please see the photo here.  I asked a friend to simply walk across the room while I took a picture with the Intelligent Auto feature on.  This is not a cool shot, AT ALL.  I repeated the process only using some of the scene settings (action specifically) and the result was a washed out noisy photo that I wouldn't think of posting.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />I decided to give the camera two stars because it does do some things really well.  For instance, it survived a couple of drops, my chalky hands while rock climbing, and a river swim in the Smoky Mountains (with complete submersion).  However at the end of the day it's supposed to do those things AND take good pictures.  I have returned my camera to Amazon (awesome return policy) and will purchase another rugged style point-and-shoot soon.  I'm considering the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS1 or even considering ""downgrading"" to the Olympus 1030SW.  I will post reviews when I have made a decision and tested the cameras out."

YouTube is a great source for background music, having easy to find, extended-play (10+ hours or streaming ‘live’) music available. I was very disappointed with regards to the Echo SHOW’s inability to directly access YouTube; can be done, but very cumbersome and difficult to navigate to the desired selections.<br />My PROs:<br />• Attractive, all-in-one compact design; device’s ‘Retro-Modern’ styling deserves a spot in the Design section of NYC’s “Museum of Modern Art”<br />• Initial set-up extremely easy<br />• Voice recognition is very good, even in a noisy environment with background music playing.<br />My CONs:<br />• Voice-only control can be very frustrating for complex inputs/requests<br />• Lack of external keyboard connection ability<br />• Answers are very short and lacking in detail<br />• Alexa’s AI needs more development (see my comments, below).<br />My WANTs:<br />• YouTube . . . Please !<br />• Keyboard connect ability as a secondary input (via ‘Bluetooth’ or USB)<br />• Audio output (low level, stereo) jack for connecting a powered external speaker system for better sound quality.<br />As noted above, I also have some reservations with respect to the ‘answers’ provided by Alexa. I personally (others my feel differently) that ‘answers’ are just too short, incomplete, and sometime WRONG (or at least, misleading). A prime example is my question regarding Gold:<br />Question: “How much does one cubic centimeter of Gold weigh?”<br />Answer: “There is 0.043 pounds of Gold in 1 milliliter.” While this answer could be correct UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, I consider it to be WRONG (IMHA)! This Q/A is an indication of AIexa’s inability to properly interpret the question ‘in context’ with common practice, and also to totally disregard the need for ‘qualification’. Alexa should realize that “Gold”, being a precious metal, traditionally uses the TROY weight system, NOT the standard AVOIRDUPOIS system. Thus, the best ‘correct’ answer is 0.0517… Troy Pounds (or, better yet, 19.32 . . grams, which is the weight of one cubic centimeter of Gold (equal in grams to the Specific Gravity). Also, weight-per-volume needs to be qualified as to temperature (and, for gases, pressure). In addition, although “milliliter’ and ‘cubic centimeter’ are equal ‘volumes’, the use of ‘milliliter’ is a bit ‘off-track’ since ‘milliliter’ is normally used in reference to ‘liquids’ not ‘solids’.<br />In summary, the Echo Show may serve the needs of many purchasers, but I found it to not meet my expectations or requirements. Alexa, and Artificial Intelligence in general, is fairly new and will continue to evolve. At some point I may ‘revisit’ this device, but for now: bye-bye Alexa.<br />*************<br />Accidentally omitted mention of using a small Bluetooth keyboard with my Fire 8 HD tablet / powered speaker mention in the above review; the keyboard makes input a lot more convenient and faster."

She is extremely happy with this iMac and wonders why she waited so long to go back to a Mac. The built in iSight camera is a great addition. The Front Row software is also nice, though limited in use. I set it up for her without a hitch, fast and easy. Getting her set with her DSL account was also a breeze. The screen is bright and clear and the added Mighty Mouse is a nice bonus. I have experience with iMacs since their debut in 1998, this is by far the most refined and elegant design. Apple has definitely hit the bulls-eye with this one. As far as G5 vs. intel goes, my choice would be the G5 if you have existing software that has not or will not be updated for awhile and you need to work now. If you are starting from scratch, I guess I would go with the intel version. That being said, I don't usually buy the first version of anything.

The cost of this monitor can buy a good desktop monitor. Over the past few months, I have not seen any deal/discount on this unit.<br /><br />2) the touchscreen. Not to say it does work or something wrong with the monitor. It's just not as useful as I thought it would have been. I think this is due to my particular use case and the way Macs are programmed to utilize the touch functionality.<br /><br />3) ok, I lied. Maybe there is a third thing can be bothersome. The screen is reflective, not matt finish. I didn't like it at first, but I think it's needed for the touchscreen.<br /><br />Now to point out what I like about this monitor and respond to some of the negative aspects<br />1) The picture quality is definitely the best comparing to many cheaper ones that I have tried, even some the slightly more expensive ones. The color accuracy is much better and coming close to MacBook Pro's monitor.<br /><br />2) 17in size with 1080P resolution seems to be a good combination for everything I do, movies and light gaming. Most of time, I use it for news, technical data display, and some web browsing.<br /><br />3) The USB C port can be used for both power and data at the same time.

However, I've never tried using a stylus or trying to write on the screen.<br /><br />Additionally, there is no VESA mount like others have said. Not an issue for me, but can be a factor depending on the use case.<br /><br />Finally, I really do like this monitor and wish to put in a good word along with some hopefully useful info for those who's on the fence.

The story of a family whose English countryside home and property must pass to the next male heir, just rubs me the wrong way.  There are five daughters in the family, and the mother's goal is to get them all married off advantageously (in case her husband drops dead and they are all kicked out).  I don't remember all the chickens, pigs and goats being all around the house, nor the wash hung on the line. Of course none of the girls, mother or father had to do a lick of work, they had servants for that...the father thanked one of them once for serving the food.  One maid hums as she passes out the clean laundry, so we're supposed to infer that as servants, they were content with their lot in life.<br /><br />Kiera Knightly plays Lizzie Bennet, who is supposed to be not very attractive, but very intelligent and witty. This is not convincing.  Ms. Knightly displayed a disturbing habit of wrinkling her nose and baring her overlapping incisors at the camera at almost every opportunity. In fact, I think her teeth should have gotten second billing.<br /><br />The rest of the story is basically the same as the novel and all following Harlequin romance stories - distant man, girl can't stand him, learns more about him, falls in love (especially when she sees his house), he falls in love with her, oh happy happy joy joy.

AGKA3UZOLCCUJX6QBOX4MOTPNK3A,B09ZXZNLNH,5,8,True,"This is similar to the frame that comes in Thermal Grizzly's kit without the lapping jig or screen printing, simple and understated unlike the gaudy Thermalright clones. This solves the problem of Intel's badly designed ILM and that's all I needed. Minor bending will correct without lapping your CPU's die cap, which is an extreme measure only intended for competition overclocking. I considered knocking a star off because this doesn't come with instructions, but there's plenty of info out there on these and it's fairly obvious what needs to be done. If you catch these with Prime shipping, it's a good deal.<br /><br />This item comes with the frame, a torx key driver, screws, and adhesive plastic washers. Use the included plastic washers to avoid any conductive contact between the frame and your motherboard. Note the position of the corner arrow etched into the frame, it should match the arrow position on the CPU. Most importantly, use only two fingers to tighten the screws, and only tighten them a little bit, maybe a quarter turn after you feel any resistance. You want to secure the CPU so it doesn't move, but not mash it into the socket.<br /><br />In addition to this item, I would suggest upgrading the backplate at the same time to a full metal bracket that extends to the heatsink mounting holes. You've already disassembled the ILM at this point, it just makes sense to replace the flimsy plastic one most coolers come with."

I got this one because it had no complaint ratings about not working, and it came with a case. I had no issue whatsoever. This Drive worked like a charm. My only complaint is I had to install a DVD app in order to use the DVD feature.

AGYZLJ3EV4L3WZVSXWCEGGAGQGSA,B084GSTBQ6,1,11,True,"UPDATE 01-14-2022: The PC is completely dead, and MSI support was useless. They basically told me to do what I had already done. When I told them that it didn't work (again), he told me it was out of warranty as of November 2020 and to have a nice day - then disconnected. Unfathomably rude and unprofessional - and it would seem that my warranty was only 7 months? Even if I was already out of warranty, the option to pay for repair sure would have been nice.<br /><br />STAY AWAY from this laptop and this horribly unprofessional company. I'm left with a useless brick and a wife who doesn't have a computer with zero options but to buy something from somebody else.<br /><br />Original 4-star review below:<br /><br />I bought this PC for my wife, as her 2-year old productivity PC was not up to the task of her newest hobby - gaming.<br /><br />Setup was as you would expect on a brand new system - easy enough, but filled to the brim with bloatware and trials that MSI no doubt gets paid to put on the drive. I spent some time removing a lot of that and installing the necessaries - 7Zip, Chrome, LibreOffice, etc.<br /><br />There are some interesting things to note that I found when trying to benchmark this system - in order to save battery, the system will dynamically switch between using the GTX 1660ti and the Intel integrated GPU. It's a neat concept, but it can cause some weird issues if you try to make changes to graphics settings.<br /><br />The one thing that bothered me the most about this setup was the RAM. It came with a single 8GB SODIMM rather than 2 4GB SODIMMs. While 8GB is enough for mostly everything, only having it in single channel versus dual channel made it really chug when my wife tried to play something like Shadow of the Tomb Raider. I had a slower 16GB stick laying around and installed it until I can grab an 8GB stick identical to what's in there.<br /><br />If you're going to purchase the base model ($1,099 at the time of this writing), I recommend grabbing another stick of RAM and hard drive for storage.<br /><br />The build quality is quite nice - but the aluminum does attract finger prints, so keep an eye on that. The bottom is easy to remove, though be wary that there is a 'Factory Sealed' sticker covering one of the screw holes. I haven't read the fine print to see if that voids any kind of warranty I have, so you may want to do that.<br /><br />Thermals seem to be okay - there are two fans inside, presumably one for the CPU and one for the GPU, and they've kept the system from thermal throttling. They can get rather loud, and one of them has an ever-so-slight whine (as if it may be juuust clipping the edge of the heatsink), but when wearing headphones, they're inaudible. It does get uncomfortably warm, so I would recommend having some sort of tray beneath it if not using it on a desk.<br /><br />When it's unplugged, performance will drop substantially, and battery life has been abysmal so far. I would say that doing normal productivity tasks (she home schools our son, for example), it's fine on battery. Count on it needing to stay plugged in while playing games on it.<br /><br />Overall, I'm satisfied with the purchase. Given the size and quality of the screen (with 120Mhz refresh, no less), the CPU, and the GPU you're getting with this package, I'd say that this is one of the better value options out there when comparing to the Dell or HP offerings."

This is the best landscape or studio DSLR in the market.  Other than not having a mode dial with Custom User Settings (U1, U2) like the D7000, this camera has near perfect ergonomics.<br /><br />However, I do not recommend the D800 for paid work that have once in a lifetime moments, such as capturing the first kiss at a wedding or truly spontaneous moments, because there is a high probability of missing focus.  When situations have no do-overs, equipment inadequacies are not an option.  This is the reason why I stopped searching for a ""good copy"" of the optically superior Sigma 35mm 1.4 and settled for the more reliable Canon.<br /><br />I have had both bodies and a replacement body (serial 3041XXX) ""fixed"" by Nikon and they felt the last fixes were good enough.  Good enough, I did not invest $18,000 into a system for good enough!  Without getting into the whole left side autofocus (AF) saga, which is readily available on other reviews and websites, the AF is horribly inconsistent even with the latest firmware (A: 1.01/B:1.02) using the center AF sensor.<br /><br />My percentage of focused photos took a massive dive with this camera; I tried compensating by closing down the aperture a few stops, but the increase in depth-of-field area was not always enough.  With the D3/D700, I would wait for moments and capture it with one shot.  The D800 missed focus often enough that I began shooting in spray n' pray style, however, often the focused photo was not what I wanted.  Creating the dilemma, do I give the client a great moment that is out of focus by meters or a ho-hum moment in focus?  When I owned the D3 and D700, I used to shoot 500-1000 photos per event, I was taking 3,000-5,000 photos with the D800.  This MASSIVE increase of photos created a workflow nightmare and my quality of work suffered (subjects centered, ISO's in the 12,800-25,600 range to allow for smaller apertures).<br /><br />Autofocus problems only get worse when in AF-C, if shooting a person walking towards the camera at a slow to medium pace in the F/1.4-2.0 range, expect 1 out of 10 perfectly focused, 1-2 acceptable, and the rest throwaways.  Stop down to F/5.6 and at best it's 50/50.  I took a huge financial hit switching to Canon (selling used, buying new), however, my two Canon 5D MkIII's get 7 perfectly focused, 2 acceptable, and about 1 throwaway running the same test of a person walking towards the camera. Stop down one or two stops for near perfect results.<br /><br />Nikon does many things better than Canon.  In body AF Assist Light, intervalometer, spot metering based on AF point, intelligent Auto ISO, better AF position selector, better access to flash options, and many more.  Overall, less menu digging, and obviously Nikon's megapixel advantage is nice for cropping.<br /><br />The ten plus (I actually lost count) trips to Nikon service centers can attest just how much I wanted this camera to work.  Nikon customer service is beyond atrocious and their technicians are incompetent.  Maybe a few years into production, new D800s will be adequate, but I will never know because I do not see myself buying Nikon again.<br /><br />The Canon 5D MkIII's sensor has less dynamic range, 1.3 bits less color space, but those 24 bits it does have are beautiful colors that require less post-processing for nice skin tones.  Because I am confident that the AF will not miss, I am now shooting 300-600 photos per event, that plus less time in post.  My turnaround went from 4-6 weeks (culling missed focus photos and fixing color) to only 2-7 days with the inferior Canon.  My clients are happier because they are getting their photos fast.  In the end, I prefer focused images taken by an average sensor, than a blurred images taken with a sensor with all the dynamic range and megapixels in the world.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />The D800 is perfect for photographers that shoot landscapes with Zeiss lenses, people that like having subjects perfectly centered, or autofocus then recompose photos in the F/5.6-11 range.  However, if you shoot wide open with fast primes and not getting the ""shot"" puts yourself or company at risk, look into another camera.  If my livelihood did not depend on camera equipment, I would have stayed with Nikon.  However, in my line of work there are no do-overs, thus the Nikon advantages gave way to its faults, and after struggling with Nikon's abysmal QC and CS in recent years (SB-900, D7000, D300s, three D800's, 28mm AFS 1.8, 35mm AFS 1.4) and reading about D600 issues.  I will not be buying a Nikon for work anytime soon.<br /><br />*********************************************<br />* Original Review<br />*********************************************<br /><br />Below are my observations after one month of ownership.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-----<br />+ Resolution:  Amazing detail when shot with the right glass and settings.<br />+ Dynamic Range:  Incredible, when shooting in lower ISO's it is near impossible to ruin a photo.  Search the internet for ""fred miranda d800 review Yosemite"" to see real life comparisons.<br />+ Color:  I recommend creating custom profiles using a [[ASIN:B002NU5UW8 X-Rite ColorChecker Passport Software]] or Adobe DNG profiler for better than Adobe LR colors.<br />+ AutoWB:  Works well in about 70% of lighting scenarios, somewhat better than the D3/D700.  *** See Tip Below ***<br />+ Low ISO:  Having a true 100 ISO is godsend for on-location lighting setups or shooting wide open in daylight.<br />+ High ISO:  The D800 and LR4 do an excellent job in controlling noise.  Using PS plug-ins a properly exposed image can print acceptable 8x10's at ISO 12800 (max for D3/D700's is 6400).<br />+ Tonality:  With a good camera profile in LR4, the tonal range rivals Fujifilm 400H Film.  This is incredibly useful on portraits with 4-1 or greater lighting ratios.  Posterization in the shadows (DSLRs Achilles' heel) is only noticeable on highly manipulated images.<br />+ Handling:  The Auto ISO is easier to engage and the new position of the ISO button is more intuitive.<br />+ Exposure:  Better than D3/D700, but far from perfect.  Contrary to Nikon's literature, it struggles with backlit scenes.<br />+ Battery Performance:  It can get me through a full day's shoot if I avoid extensive LiveView or WiFi use, otherwise I need to use a backup battery.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-----<br />- Software:  Nikon software can produce excellent results, but it is clunky and slow.<br />- Handling:  Awkward placement of the mode selector button (to make room for movie record), lacking the D7000 U1/U2 style custom banks, switching of AF modes is not as effortless as the D700.<br />- Autofocus: All 51 points are still too centrally located, no increase in cross-type sensors over the D3/D700, all the cross-type AF sensors are in the middle, like the D3/700, the outer sensors are near useless in low lit, low contrast situations.  * For more details on AF performance, see update above and comments<br /><br />Summary:<br />Using proper technique, the images this camera produces are superior to any camera I ever shot.  Would I jump systems for this camera?  If I owned a large collection of top-tier gear, NO!  Otherwise, I would consider it if I was not too invested.  Does it equal or better Medium Format?  There are differences in perspective, defraction limits, DOF, FOV, and CANNOT BE COMPARED.  Having shot Canon (AE-1, 630, A2, Elan II, 20D, 40D, 5D mkI & mkII, 1D's), Nikon (FM, F4, F100, D200, D300s, D7000, D700, D800, D3), Fuji (S3, S5), Mamiya (645, RB67), and Hasselblad (H4D-40), I know that they are excellent tools that are capable of creating amazing images.  Pick the one that best fits your needs and have fun shooting.<br /><br />*** TIP *** To improve WB (green cast), use the WB Fine-Tune (pg. 149) and shift Magenta 1 or 2 points or use a X-Rite Passport for every scene change."

AEI5QEJAFJHPBOEFBTFXZG7VFSDQ,B07F2R5TFQ,5,1,True,"I've now built 4 PCs in the past 7 years or so, and this is by far the best case in which I've ever built.<br /><br />If you're considering this case, you're probably here because you've immediately noticed how stylish it is. It's just as pretty and sleek in real life as it is in photos, so if that's your primary concern, go ahead and make the purchase.<br /><br />However, what isn't readily apparent in photos is just how high quality the materials are. The sleek brushed aluminum panels are solid and pleasantly hefty, though not so heavy they weigh the case down unnecessarily. Further, they all slide into place and lock one another together in an impressive, intelligently designed way so that the case remains solid even before applying the thumbscrews to lock everything down. This is more of a big deal than it sounds—nearly every case in which I've built (even the expensive ones) feature some kind of annoying rattling, or a panel or fan screen that doesn't quite fit as snugly as you'd like. As the PC ages and the fans vibrate everything continuously over years of use, this tends to create rattles and light ambient noise that will annoy you more and more over years of usage.<br /><br />I'm now nearly 6 months into using this case, and I've got 9 fans in it (probably overkill, but let me live). I'm a heavy gamer, so those fans are often spinning at 100%, and this case has zero rattles whatsoever. Airflow is superb and it keeps components clean. I have used cases in the past which featured plastic windows and had poor airflow, this case has solid, heavy glass, and airflow is impeccable. It's also got superb layout for easy cable management and PSU mounting, and although it tucks the PSU behind the motherboard, I haven't noticed any heat issues from this location, as fresh air is amply supplied via properly located vents in the case.<br /><br />I've heard people say building in this case is somewhat difficult, but it's been by far the easiest case for me to build in out of others. Whether this is due to my growing skill at building multiple PCs, or because the case is better designed, is difficult for me to say. But I don't consider myself a master builder or anything like that (I build only for myself and for pleasure), so I'd lean towards the latter.<br /><br />I've gushed enough, so to summarize, I'll say that this case looks beautiful, it's impeccably designed, the materials it uses are superb, and it's easy to build in. It's also far cheaper than some of the other top cases on the market.<br /><br />Lian Li has made a fan of me. The only way I'll ever replace this case is if Lian Li releases a better model. You really can't go wrong with it, unless you need an optical drive. But who needs an optical drive in 2020?"
AEJ6L45ORZ7ZTSQ2O6VZGSBC3DHA,B00PJSFR7Y,5,1,True,"I purchased this cooler and used it with the i7 5820K.  It is a big cooler, but it is shaped so that it allows for your RAM To fit underneath.  It only hung over one side of the RAM slots on the MSI x99s gaming 7 motherboard.<br /><br />I checked out the other big name coolers (Noctua, Phanteks, Corsair), and came to the conclusion that the size and function of this cooler would be the best.  I really wanted to try the liquid coolers, but the stories of leaks was enough to keep me away.  The Noctua 2011 cooler seemed too large, and I didn't want something that would dominate the entire motherboard.  This cooler fits the bill quite nicely.<br /><br />The cooler was easy to install on the socket 2011 motherboard, and performs well with overclocking.  I used Artic Silver 5 thermal paste with cooler.  I bumped it up to 4ghz, and while gaming it runs from 45-50C.  At idle, with Intel Speedstep enabled, it runs anywhere from 28-35C.  If you won't be overclocking, then it will be way more than you could ever need as a cooler.<br /><br />I would recommend this cooler.  It is efficient, just big enough, and a nice price."
AEJ6L45ORZ7ZTSQ2O6VZGSBC3DHA,B00AW71U5U,5,15,False,"I chose this laptop over a few others for it's value and for the potential of what it can do with a few extra additions to the computer.<br /><br />DESIGN<br /><br />The design of the computer is excellent.  It has a smooth metal brownish-grey finish, full size keyboard with numpad, and a nice responsive trackpad that is easy to use.  The keyboard is chiclet style, and is easy to type on and responsive.  One downside is that the keyboard is not backlit, but at the price this should be expected.<br /><br />SPECS<br /><br />It's important to note that the processor specs listed on Amazon at the time of this review are incorrect.  As listed on MSI's website (and what came with my laptop), the processor is a Intel i7-3630QM, not an Apple A4 (do PC's even come with Apple processors?).  The 3630QM is a quad-core processor at 2.4ghz, with a max turbo of 3.4ghz.  The laptop also has a max RAM capacity of 16GB (only comes with 6GB, however), and has SATA3.  These were both important factors for me for future upgrades to the laptop.<br /><br />The resolution is 1366x768, so you do give up some screen space, but again at this price that is to be expected as well.<br /><br />FUNCTION<br /><br />The laptop comes with surprisingly little bloat, with a few MSI utilities and Winzip, of all things.  I found the computer to be quite responsive, even with the 5400rpm drive.  Gaming is nice with the 645M Nvidia card.  I play a lot of SWTOR and Guild Wars 2, both of which worked well.<br /><br />One thing to note on this laptop is that MSI puts a tamper sticker right over one of the screw holes on the backplate of the laptop, so that putting in upgrades will essentially void your warranty (the sticker states that warranty is void if sticker is tampered with).  It's a risk you will take if you plan on upgrading right away.<br /><br />The machine doesn't come with recovery disks, but it does have an MSI utility to burn recovery disks on the desktop.<br /><br />The screen quality is good, not great.  I wouldn't put it up there as the best, but it is quite clear with good color representation.  Viewing angles are not great, as the color washes out quickly as you get at more of an angle.  This has been my experience with most laptops.<br /><br />All in all I feel this is a great value for the money.  It features several mid to higher end pieces that will allow you to have an above average laptop to do some gaming on, especially with more RAM and an SSD upgrade.  As is, it still can handle current games (but surely not as well as a high end laptop or desktop)."
AEJ6L45ORZ7ZTSQ2O6VZGSBC3DHA,B005UDITPK,5,22,True,"My reasons for buying this board:<br /><br />PCI-E 3.0 support<br />USB 3.0 ports<br />SATA 6 GB/s support<br />Used ASUS for my past 5 builds<br /><br />Really, the only difference between the PRO and the next version down from this board is the SATA 6 GB/s connectors on the board.  This is worth the extra dollars if you plan on using one of the newer SSD's that support this.<br /><br />The board itself was an easy install (well, easy in terms of installing a motherboard, which can take an hour or so with all the components), and I feel the quality is excellent.  I had to position my Cooler Master CPU cooler towards the side of the case to avoid covering one of the RAM slots, but I was fortunate to have it pointing right at a vent anyway (Hyper 212 Plus cooler and Cooler Master HAF 912 case).  Paired the board with Intel i7 2600K and Patriot Viper Extreme Division 4 1866MHz 16GB.  Working well with both, no BSOD's.  New BIOS is great, love the fact that you can use a mouse and the interface no longer looks like an old DOS program."

The picture didn't even match what I received!!  They obviously have this one all messed up."
AHCJYRPRAJQHKZRYWHQZW5OLZBWA,B07MC8BLC3,5,2,False,"I kind of had a grudge against tower heatsinks for CPUs. Last time I put one on was in the early days of the Hyper 212, which started the design trend. It was a monster to install, really obnoxious.<br /><br />This one was much easier, just pop stand offs on the AM4 backplate, paste it and screw it on. Temps went from 87 during a cinebench load to 67. I'd say a 20c difference was worth the 30 bucks.<br /><br />Some advice:<br /><br />1. The standoffs are not labeled well, or at all, actually. You want the ""medium"" ones, I'd say for the AM4 slot. Not the tall ones, and not the ones with the stout ends. You know you are right because they will screw in much easier. I know this sounds stupid but for people like me, it'll make sense once you're putting it in practice.<br /><br />2. Don't sweat the paste. All you need to do with thermal paste is use enough. Tech sites and channels have shown, over and over in recent years that as long as you have full coverage it is fine. They include enough paste for one application, so just use it up and be done with it. (At least on a Ryzen chip, which are a bit larger than Intel)<br /><br />3. When doing the screws, rest the motherboard on its box (or hold up on the backplate from behind the case) and do each one just a tiny bit at a time. AM4's backplate gets really finnicky if you screw one part too much in at first, you'll know because it'll raise up the opposite side and you won't be able to make contact. If this happens, just unscrew the previous one(s) a little and it'll level out.<br /><br />4. Don't worry about wobbling or gap/space on the backplate and board, it'll be like that until the actual heatsink is fully screwed in. I've seen a few concerns about this but just carry on with the install and you'll have no issue.<br /><br />9 out of 10 quality product for the price, I'd say 10 if the instructions or labeling were better. It isn't a difficult system but it is  a bit obtuse without previous experience with the socket."
AFQUEDDUEKS22CHSMB2S4CAI6IRA,B07F2DPR3G,5,1,True,"Sadly, I discovered my motherboard is not able to read the master boot record off the PCIe port, despite that, the Rivo PCI-E Riser PCIe M.2 PCIe SSD to PCIe Express 3.0 x 4 Adapter Card adapter does however make data storage available when using the Intel Solid State Drive (SSD) 660P Series 1 TB and other M.2 drives.  The only issue of course is the main screw is a challenge to hold in place when mounting your M.2 drive so precision is required.  As M.2 prices decline I'll definitely reinstall this adapter to use an M.2 SSD for use as extra storage until I upgrade my motherboard.  It's made of very high quality and highly recommended, I might add that it looks really cool as well!"
AFQUEDDUEKS22CHSMB2S4CAI6IRA,B07GCL6BR4,5,0,True,"I tried to make the Intel Solid State Drive (SSD), 660P Series 1 TB my main internal drive but discovered my motherboard does not support master booting from the PCI Express Port when using an adapter, I therefore went with a SATA 3 SSD, but then found use for the Intel 660P SSD with an SSK Aluminum M.2 NVME SSD Enclosure Adapter (also found on Amazon) and then connected to Xbox One S via USB 3.0 port.  Games save and load very quickly.  It does get a bit hot inside the enclosure but since I have Gamepass, I really needed the extra storage this SSD provides.  It's also very small and can hide behind my Xbox.  I recommend the Intel Solid State Drive (SSD), 660P Series 1 TB for multiple uses even if you want to use for a laptop, it's small portable and durable."
AE4CQXRSGUXWPSONX3OE7DMXILKA,B00NGK92IM,4,43,False,"I was hoping to keep this a short and concise review. This is the shortest I could do :)<br /><br />TOP HEAVY: as a laptop, this is top heavy, which is not a surprise, since the screen is also a fully-fledged tablet, while the keyboard is just a keyboard and nothing else. Not a big deal, but it's something to be mindful when holding or opening it if you are used to conventional laptops which feel more balanced even at the 11.6"" screen size. Speaking of opening, this requires conscious effort to open. A plus if you have a problem with laptops opening on their own, a minus if you like to easily and single-handedly open laptops.<br /><br />DETACHING: the attaching and detaching is easy, no special skills needed. Just align it and the strong magnet grabs a hold of it. When attaching, be careful not to get your fingertips caught between the tablet and keyboard part. It is a strong magnet. Mine didn't get caught but if you are not paying attention, it may happen. Detaching is simple as well... Sometimes when detaching/attaching, an on-screen message appears telling you to eject the device using the System Tray before you physically remove it. However, there is nothing in the System Tray for ejecting the keyboard. Not sure why you would need to anyway, since the keyboard is just a keyboard. Maybe I'm missing something... The Display Mode here is a bit different, the keyboard does not rotate all the way or sideways. Instead, you put the tablet backwards on the keyboard, so the screen is facing you, and the keyboard is behind the screen. Useful for watching movies, slideshows, reading books, flipping through magazines, essentially it's a tablet on a stand.<br /><br />KEYBOARD: for a 10-inch keyboard, I was pleasantly surprised with A-Z (letters) and numbers touch-typing. The letters are a decent size and with good spacing for touch typing. However, a lot of the other keys are small to smaller. There's only one CTRL (left side). The Escape is really tiny. The arrow keys occupy a tiny rectangle area on the bottom right corner of the keyboard. It has very tiny Page Up and Page Down buttons that don't need FN. With FN, those two become Home and End... There are no lights of any kind on the keyboard, caps lock changes show on the screen only. The virtual keypad is pressing FN and a few letters/numbers on the middle-right side. You are better off attaching a USB numeric keypad if you have to do any serious data entry... There are no dedicated music play/pause buttons, however, if you press the FN plus mute or volume up/down keys on the keyboard, it brings up the playback app on the screen which has play/pause (depending on which music app you are using)... There's only so much one can squeeze on a 10"" laptop keyboard... The keyboard does not have legs, however, I never felt the need to prop it up. The further back you push the screen, the higher the keyboard angle gets, so you have some flexibility there... On clean marble type surfaces, especially when the keyboard is brand new, it has a tendency to glide a little bit, so be mindful of that... X-Files: there is a magnetic area on the rightmost side of the palm rest of the keyboard (it decisively grabs paper clips) - rightmost edge, below the right arrow. Not sure why.<br /><br />OTG PARTY: the micro-USB port on the tablet side worked with an OTG (microUSB to USB) cable. I was able to attach (one at a time) a USB keyboard, USB mouse, wireless USB dongle (for wireless keyboards/mice). The wireless keyboard and mouse also worked on the keyboard's USB 2.0 port. This worked with two different mouse/keyboard combo sets (Logitech MK270 and AmazonBasics). You can have a keyboard and mouse party, with multiple sets of them connected and working at the same time :)... Speaking of connections, the instructions that come with it suggest that if you are going to connect external spinning hard disks, to power the hard disks on their own (not use  the Switch's USB power)<br /><br />TOUCHPAD: the touchpad is nice for a small keyboard, you get an area of roughly 9x5 cm. The two finger tap (mouse right click equivalent) is pretty handy. What is sorely missing is the three finger horizontal swipe to switch tabs within a browser (ChromeOS). You have options for adjustments in the settings.<br /><br />Micro-HDMI: using a random micro-HDMI to HDMI cable, I connected it to a TV/monitor. You have multiple options, extend the screen, duplicate the screen, or use the TV only (the tablet screen turns off). When you duplicate, you only get a smaller window on the TV (if your TV is more than 1280x800). When you extend or use the TV only options, it fills up the whole TV screen (1080p screen in my case). It is quick and easy to switch between duplicate, extend, TV-only, tablet-only.<br /><br />BUTTON PRESS ROW: the Power and Windows buttons are both on the same side (right side) and depending on how you are handling or storing the tablet or laptop, you can easily press either one of them accidentally. The headphone port is nearby as well, another opportunity for an accidental button press while adding/removing headphones. It may take a couple of weeks to get used to it. After about 3 weeks, I no longer press them accidentally. Initially I was frequently hitting either the Power or Windows buttons... By the way, the Volume Up/Down buttons on the tablet side increase/decrease the volume by 2% with each press.<br /><br />WATCHING VIDEOS: only some of the major video streaming apps are available in the Windows Store (I used Flixster, WatchESPN), however, you can switch to the Windows Desktop side for a lot more options. I streamed videos without issue from Amazon Instant Video and M-Go using Firefox with Silverlight, and also watched iTunes TV shows downloaded (if you don't have to have an iPad, a Windows 8 tablet is an affordable way to watch your iTunes movies/videos!)... Speaking of WatchESPN, I watched a couple of basketball games, and it was pretty good. Despite the small screen, I was able to easily read the player's jersey numbers and follow the action without issues or distractions. The screen was able to handle the fast paced action... The tablet has front speakers, facing you in laptop mode and tablet (landscape) mode. As with most small devices, there's only so loud they can get. In noisy situations, headphones or external speakers are probably needed...<br /><br />BLUETOOTH: I did not have any issues with the bluetooth devices I connected (headphones and mouse).<br /><br />CHARGING: while charging, the light is orange. When charging is complete, it turns to blue. The charging light is on the opposite side of the charging port, which can be confusing because the headphones port and charging port are similar in size (but if you look closely, there is a marking on the charging port). Charging happens through the charging port using the included AC adapter. It is a compact adapter. Vertically, it only takes one spot on the wall (use top or bottom if you have more than two). The only removable part of the AC adapter is the charging head (only one is included for North America). It does not appear to charge via USB. I never saw a charging light when connected to a PC.<br /><br />INSTALLATION/SETUP: fill up the coffee machine. It took me about two hours wall time to get all the updates and upgrades through Windows Update. Lots of reboots. Lots of them! You don't have to stare at the screen for those two hours straight, but you need to glance at it every few minutes. You can use a local account or Microsoft account. You need a Microsoft account in order to get a free app from the Windows Store. You only need to add a credit card if you want to buy a premium app... Boot to Desktop is one of the options in the handy Acer Shortcut app that lives in the system tray and task bar... There are plenty of customizations and adjustments to make, if you jump into the various settings and options on the Metro and Desktop side.<br /><br />CASES: I haven't looked for a custom case for this, since I mostly use it as a laptop when I am on the go, and whatever worked for other laptops, works for this too. Of the universal tablet cases I tried for the tablet-only, this tablet was a bit too long for them.<br /><br />OFFICE 365: you get a one year subscription to Office 365. You don't get the Office software to own forever. A product key is included in the packaging that activates your subscription. It is ""Office 365 Personal for Windows 8.1 with Bing for Small Tablets"". It says you must redeem by 12/31/16.<br /><br />BLOATWARE: McAfee is the most annoying. You get a 30 day trial. It comes activate. Site Advisor is also installed. It is a two step uninstall. First uninstall as usual from Control Panel, then download (!) an uninstaller program from McAfee to completely get rid of it. Windows includes its own security software (Defender and Firewall), so it takes over within seconds after you get rid of McAfee.<br /><br />MEASUREMENTS: out of the box, the 64GB version has 46.8GB available... The processor is the Intel Z3735F 1.33 GHz (the last time I looked there were two different processor mentioned in the description)... It is 32-bit Windows 8.1 with Bing... Tablet weighs 1 lb 3.8 oz on its own. Keyboard weighs 1 lb 2.2 oz on its own. As a laptop, it weighs 2 lbs 6.1 oz. The AC adapter weighs 3.4 oz... Made in China says the included paperwork.<br /><br />DESKTOP SIDE SAVES THE DAY: as of review time, the Windows Store still has a big gap in the popular apps versus iOS/Android. Not just the number of apps but the features as well. For example, Evernote Touch and Kindle (no zoom!) are subpar on the Windows Store side vs their iOS/Android versions. What saves the day for those, and many others, is that you can simply switch to the Desktop, and either use the Windows Desktop app or use the Browser for the web interface. A 10-inch screen, and a nice one at that, is quite usable for many of the non-complicated Windows Desktop apps. Case in point, I prefer the Evernote and Kindle desktop apps over their Windows Store versions... Not all Windows Store apps are subpar. For example, the Amazon shopping app scrolls sideways at a blazing speed, and the WatchESPN app is pretty smooth...<br /><br />Vs CHROMEBOOKS: Chromebooks finally have competition. The SSD makes a noticeable difference in the usability of Windows versus Windows laptops with slow spinning hard disks. I end up using this more often than the Chromebook, which was not the case with my previous hard disk based Windows laptop. Of course you still have the usual Windows issues and annoyances and quirks and irritations, but you have more flexibility, for example you can install as many browsers as you want (an easy way for multiple people in the same household to keep their stuff separate without having to log-in and log-out all the time). Chromebooks now have Multi-SignIn which is an improvement, but not as flexible as separate browsers.<br /><br />AVID READER TIP: arrange the tablet in Display Mode (tablet in front of the keyboard), attach a USB mouse, sit back on your chair, and use the scroll wheel of the mouse to change pages in the Kindle reader app. Lean Back Reading!"
AE5FHDAHTOGQPTIFMLDKSEPKNOKA,B06ZYHPYRZ,5,0,True,Came in perfect condition. Is defintely a smooth matte finish top and bottom part. The keyboard cover fits perfectly and is equally beautiful. The screen protector wasnt a perfect match however the gap is not noticeable unless youre looking for it. Very easy to put on and feels sturdier than my last case. Very impressed overall since the price isnt bad. They even have a soft case that almost exactly matches these hard shell covers
AE7Y6T6NQ3S53VM5AYOJC7X2H34A,B07CPTF5LL,4,2,True,"I've had the machine for a couple of weeks now, and though I bought it without the benefit of any prior reviews, the specs look good, and the price was right, so I took a chance. And I'm very glad I did. First, some numbers from an evaluation program called, ""Why So Slow?"" (WSS), which is helpful in evaluating so-called 'low end' computers.<br /><br />The Jumper computer (which I've named EZ Jumper), comes with an Intel Atom processor rated @ 1.44 MHz, WSS rated its speed during its speed test at a minimum of 1.679, with a burst rate of 1.920 MHz. And while the speed was higher than the minimum rating, the temperature stayed within a respectable range of between 69 to 74 degrees Celsius.<br /><br />EZ ships with 4 GB of RAM and 64 GB of on board storage, which I immediately augmented with the maximum amount of additional storage through the use of a 128 GB Class 10 TF card. During my testing with WSS, this reduced my CPU load from 72.4% down to 32.8%, and my memory load down to 56.4%. WSS reported no page faults or other problems originating from the BIOS or Chipset.<br /><br />So why only 4 1/2 stars and not 5 stars? During my initial programming of EZ Jumper I ran into some bottlenecks when updating the OS, though these later resolved themselves when I let EZ do the updating it on its own. Secondly, the Windows Experience Index is only a 3.5, though I don't find it lacking in anything I use the computer for. Lastly is the lack of some external ports, i.e., there is only 1 USB 3.0, and no USB C port. To solve this I installed a 7 port powered USB 3.0 hub, with an non-powered 4 port hub for battery use. Nonetheless, 4+ stars is a pretty solid rating for a pretty solid little computer."
AE7Y6T6NQ3S53VM5AYOJC7X2H34A,B01M4MZVUT,5,2,True,"In summary, this is the most powerful computer I have ever owned. It has everything I wanted in a 2016 personal computer, and it beats out many of the machines that are being touted as the best for 2017. Mentioning just some of its good points,<br /><br /> 1) It has 16 GB of dual channel RAM, most computers come with 8 GB of single channel memory;<br /> 2) It has a dedicated video card in the Radeon R7 350 with 2 GB of the fastest video memory available, GDDR5 (most graphics are embedded<br />  on the motherboard using shared memory to power it);<br /> 3) The video card supports dual monitors, with both VGA and HDMI outputs;<br /> 4) It comes with a built in DVD-RW, and an extra large and fast 2 TB, 7200 RPM HDD; and,<br /> 5) It comes with the AMD FX- 870x processor, which I prefer over the Intel core, mainly because of how the CPU syncs with the installed<br />  graphics card, and, how RAM syncs with VRAM.<br /><br />Now for the downside issues.<br /><br />The first downside is what seems to be excess heat from the CPU processor; a common issue on some of Lenovo's desktop computers. I have since talked at length with a contracted member of WorldWide TechServices [wwts.com] about the readings from SpeedFan [Softpedia.com], and Speccy [Piriform.com], which showed a range from a minimum temperature of the upper 70sC to a peak of 91C. As the tech person put it, 'its like comparing the physical temperature of a book on the one hand, and fresh lemons on the other end of the spectrum - there's no comparing the two'. Instead, he talked about the &#34;thermal margin&#34; of Advanced A10 (and above) CPUs and Chipsets. While its way too much to get into here, the software and its user manual are available for free from the AMD website (see attached); [amd.com].<br /><br />My own foray showed one overriding 'gap' in the air flow through the case:  the interior of the H50-55 case does not have a straight-line path for cooler air from the outside to flow onto and past the CPU, before finally exiting out the back of the case. In the supplied case, the air flow must make two 90 degree turns in order to vent the heat back outside. Possible options for correcting this include:<br /><br /> 1) Redesigning where the interior components are mounted to create the straight airflow path  (Lenovo's responsibility);<br /> 2) Using a much larger front side fan to draw in more air from the outside  (also Lenovo's responsibility);<br /> 3) Including in the design an exhaust style fan in the rear of the case to forcibly draw hot air from inside the computer back outside  (also<br />  Lenovo's responsibility); or,<br /> 4) Mounting a small quiet fan on the outside of the computer in the rear, powered through a USB connection  (easily done by the end user).<br /><br />As a practical matter I decided to use Option 4, which also addresses the cause of the other downside issue:  a proprietary power supply. It is one of Lenovo's own design and is more than sufficient to run the components included with this system; but, it lacks any additional power take-offs. Meaning there is no way to add an item to the computer if it requires a direct connection to the computer's power supply, as most fans do. This was borne out by Lenovo Tech Support personnel, who told me in two different online chat sessions that I'd have to replace the power supply if I wanted to power any extra components.<br /><br />Since I wanted to keep the computer because of its specs and performance, I nonetheless felt the need to address the extra heat being generated. To do this I removed the port covers on the back panel of the computer, and then mounted a very small clip-on fan that runs off of a USB 2.0 port [Amazon.com]. I clipped the fan to the vertical support post where the expansion card slots are located. This drew out the hot air generated by the CPU, and since this fans power source was a USB 2.0 port on the outside of the case, no power supply issues occurred.<br /><br />These two downsides notwithstanding, this is one powerful computer that I'm very happy to own.<br /><br />Regards,<br />BearPup<br /><br />UPDATE:  During a recent hot spell I had turned on our air conditioner. Shortly after it came on I noticed that the computers temperature values had decreased significantly. Based on this I ordered a small clip on fan in order to direct cooler air on to the computer. Within an hour the core temperature had dropped about 10 degrees Celsius, and the thermal margin had also decreased by about 7 degrees Celsius. With this change in the thermal values, my rating of this powerhouse of a computer scores a perfect 5 out of 5 stars. It just doesn't get any better than this."

It has everything I wanted in a 2016 /17 personal computer, and, only 2 things that nobody wants. First the good points:<br /><br />  1)  It has 16 GB of dual channel RAM, most computers come with 8 GB of single channel memory;<br />  2)  It has a dedicated video card in the Radeon R7 350 with 2 GB of the fastest video memory available, VDDR5 (most graphic are embedded on the motherboard);<br />  3)  The video card supports dual monitors, with both VGA and HDMI;<br />  4)  It comes with a built in DVD-RW, and an extra large and fast 2 TB, 7200 RPM HDD; and,<br />  5)  It comes with the AMD FX- processor, which I prefer over the Intel core, mainly because of how the CPU syncs with the installed graphics card, and, of how RAM syncs with VRAM.<br /><br />Now for the downside issues.<br /><br />The first downside is excess heat from the CPU processor; this is a problem common to some of Lenovo's desktop computers. As I write this I am awaiting contact from a local Lenovo repair service; I've no idea what parts they are planning to fix. My own diagnosis tells me that the main cause of the heat problem is the lack of a proper airflow through the mini tower case. The interior of this H50-55 case does not have a straight line path for cooler air from the outside to flow into, past the CPU, and then finally exiting out the back of the case. In the supplied case, the air flow must make two 90 degree turns in order to vent the heat outside.

This was borne out by Lenovo Tech Support personnel, who told me that I'd have to replace the power supply if I wanted to power any extra components.<br /><br />Also pointing to Option #4, was my wanting to keep the computer because of its specs and performance, while also needing to address the extra heat being generated. After removing the port covers on the back panel of the computer, I mounted an 80mm fan on the outside of the back panel using cable ties. This drew out the hot air generated by the CPU. Since this fans power source was a USB 2.0 port on the outside of the case, no power supply issues occurred. The net result of adding the fan was a 35 degree C decrease in reported CPU temperature, which dropped from 86 C down to 51 C, which is a significant drop.<br /><br />These two downsides notwithstanding (-1 star), this is one powerful computer that I'm pleased to own and use. I'll post back here after the Lenovo technician visits."

AFHJ75ULPJHIGXTU4IUTV3ELYZEQ,B00JNAA54O,4,4,False,"The Good:<br />+ Highly Portable<br />+ Good CPU Performance<br />+ Value - Outperforms Its Price<br /><br />The Bad:<br />- Awkward Controls<br />- Dull/Muted Display<br />- Bloatware<br /><br />Overall:  The ASUS MeMO Pad 8 is for budget-minded users looking for a highly portable tablet.<br /><br />Background:  The ASUS MeMO Pad 8 is the second in the MeMO Pad line that I have reviewed (see my review of the MeMO Pad FHD 10).<br /><br />Design:  ASUS can’t seem to get out of their own way when it comes to design.  While the build of the MeMO Pad 8 doesn’t feel as cheap as the FHD 10, the control placement makes for a frustrating user experience.  The volume rocker and the power button are along the right side (in portrait mode), but they are at a weird angle as the edges of the tablet are slanted inward from front to back.  This makes the buttons hard to press, and I find that I am always hitting volume down when I want the power (and screen lock) button.  It is unfortunate because these are controls that users need every time they use the tablet.<br /><br />Setup:  As seems to be standard with ASUS tablets, it begins with an 8 hour charging cycle.  It’s not a dealbreaker, but it puts a damper on the new tablet experience.  The real setup process is smooth as it should be by this stage of Android tablet development.  Unlike all other tablets I’ve owned, this one did not have a firmware update.  You are off to the races at this stage.<br /><br />Display:  The resolution of the MeMO Pad 8 is 1280 x 800 which is typical of 7”/8” tablets - the noted exceptions are the iPad Mini w/Retina Display and the Samsung Galaxy Tab S 8.4, which have superior displays but at superior prices.  However, resolution is not what disappointed me in the MeMO Pad 8.  The display is dull and dark compared to the FHD 10.  I applied the same background wallpaper on each device, and the difference is significant.  This affects every aspect of using the tablet - other than something like music playback where you aren’t using the screen.<br /><br />Gaming:  While the display doesn’t yield the most fulfilling experience, the Intel processor handles intensive games without blinking.  I fired up Riptide GP2 with low expectations, but there were no hesitations or skips during play.  Other games (such as Zen Pinball) are just better on a 10-inch tablet.<br /><br />Portability:  This is the main appeal of the MeMO Pad 8 over the FHD 10.  It is much easier to carry - especially for people like my wife who carries her iPad mini in her purse.  In addition to being smaller, it is also lighter.  One other side benefit of the size is that thumb typing is easier than it is on 10-inch tablets.<br /><br />Bloatware:  It’s a way of life for Android tablets that don’t come directly from Google.  Disable the apps, and grit your teeth once at the wasted space.  As they said on Battlestar Galactica, “All of this has happened before and will happen again.”<br /><br />Overall:  The ASUS MeMO Pad 8 seems to have two main benefits that I’ll call the “two P’s” - portability and price.  This is a budget tablet that provides slightly better than budget performance.  If portability is not a major concern for you, I would strongly recommend that you consider the FHD 10 instead.  The current price gap is around $10, but the features and performance make this a no-brainer."
AFHJ75ULPJHIGXTU4IUTV3ELYZEQ,B00DXFDI4O,5,315,False,"The Good:<br /><br />+ Extra Smooth, Fast Navigation<br />+ Video Playback<br />+ Music Playback<br />+ Games<br />+ Good Browser Experience<br />+ Long Battery Life<br />+ Micro-USB Charging Port (Finally!)<br />+ Intel Processor<br />+ Priced Right<br />+ Plenty of Case Options<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />- Lots of Bloatware<br />- Feels Cheap<br /><br />Overall:  The materials might feel cheap, but ASUS gets the rest of the table experience right this time.<br /><br />Design:  I guess to get the rest of the experience at this price, ASUS had to compromise on design materials.  The back casing of the ASUS MeMO Pad FHD 10 makes most netbooks feel like they were made of prime materials by comparison.  There's no way to sugar coat it.  The MeMO Pad feels like a toy compared to the brushed aluminum on the Transformer Pad Infinity.  It is also not the thinnest or lightest tablet compared to the likes of the Sony Xperia Z.  However, this is where my gripes essentially end with the MeMO Pad.<br /><br />Setup:  The instructions recommended a minimum of 8 hours charging, and I dropped mine on the charger and left it overnight.  This is a bit of a buzzkill for the excitement of a new tablet, but it is worth it.  You will benefit in long-term battery performance over the life of the tablet.  Other than that, ASUS has an easy to follow guided process that even first time users will be able to follow without issue.  There was a firmware update available, and I installed it before proceeding.  From this point forward, I experience boot-up times of about 35-40 seconds.  It's not the fastest, but it is vastly better than the Transformer Pad Infinity.<br /><br />Video Playback:  This is the punch line for a ""Full HD"" tablet, right?  Well, ASUS did a great job.  I fed the MeMO Pad some eye candy in the form of Thor and Beowulf from Netflix.  I have always thought that the throne room scene at the beginning of Thor was striking, and the colors were as rich as ever.  Beowulf is a relatively new entrant on Netflix, but it came through in all its glory as well.  One other Netflix improvement is in the actual navigation of the app itself.  Every other tablet I've used (Acer Iconia A100, ASUS Transformer Pad Infinity, and Sony Xperia Z) had poor, choppy navigation when scrolling through movies.  I am very pleased to say that this is not the case on the MeMO Pad.  Perhaps it is the new Intel chip that makes the difference.  This starts a trend of performance over design.<br /><br />Music Playback:  While it is definitely bigger than your phone (or dedicated mp3 player), the target use for the MeMO Pad is still with headphones.  The speakers are sufficient for watching video or playing games, but they lack the bass required to provide an enjoyable, balanced music listening session.  However, I used both my Monster Diesel Vektr (corded) and Plantronics BackBeat Go 2 (Bluetooth) headphones, and the experience is quite good.  If for some reason you don't already have a device to play mp3s, this will get the job done.  The Play Music app is the default for local music play, and both it and the Amazon MP3 apps can play from the cloud.<br /><br />Gaming:  Call me old school, but I love pinball.  I have been a fan of Zen Pinball since it came on my Acer tablet a couple of years ago.  The HD screen makes tables such as The Avengers pop visually, but the gameplay was smoother than I have experienced on my other tablets.  There was never a hitch or a jerk in the display.  While this is far from the most taxing game out there, I noticed a surprising improvement over the Transformer Pad Infinity.  The performance over design trend continues.<br /><br />Navigation:  I mentioned this earlier about Netflix, but the smooth navigation carries over into all aspects of the MeMO Pad.  Both the app tray and Chrome are snappy and smooth.  In the past, I have always been a bit envious of iPad owners because everything flowed so effortlessly.  This tablet is the first Android offering that has performed in the same zip code as the iPad.  I don't know how to account for it with certainty, but I do know that this is the first tablet I've had with the new Intel Clover Trail+ chip.  Whatever the cause, it's about time!<br /><br />Other:  The battery life on the MeMO Pad is as advertised.  The first charge lasted for three days of intermittent use.  ASUS finally went away from the proprietary charging port to micro-USB.  It is so nice not to have to worry about carrying around my one and only charger for my tablet.  It will just work with the one myriad of micro-USB chargers I have at home, work, in the car, etc.  You might accuse me of burying the lead on this, but all this goodness comes at a substantial discount over the Transformer Pad Infinity prices.  The only thing the Infinity has over the MeMO is the brushed aluminum case.  (All apologies to the ""Dock"" owners, but that is a component destined for failure from stress/wear and tear.)<br /><br />Complaints:  The list is pretty short.  I've already mentioned the cheap feel of the back panel.  The other thing that I don't like is common to most tablets - lots of bloatware.  Perhaps I am the outlier on this, but I just can't imagine that users are chomping at the bit to use the one off ASUS apps over things that are more generally available.  The only way to avoid them is to go with a ""pure Android"" device from Google, and I guess I can't be too harsh.  Since Android 4.0, you can disable and hide unwanted apps.  I just wish the tablet and computer makers would stop it.<br /><br />Conclusion:  Although I wish it had nicer material for the back panel, I can't take exception with much else about this tablet from ASUS.  Whatever it is that they've changed since the ""Transformer"" line; it works.  This tablet is strong to quite strong.  You get your money's worth, and I highly recommend it."
AFHJ75ULPJHIGXTU4IUTV3ELYZEQ,B004EWEZM4,3,10,False,"Background:  I own an HP Mini 210 netbook, and I have a Droid X phone.  These devices set my expectations for netbook and touchscreen performance.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />* Sharp Display<br />* Generous Storage<br />* Newer Intel Atom N550 Processor<br />* Very Good Sound Quality<br />* Windows 7 Home Premium Edition<br />* Netbook Performance<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />* Tablet Performance<br />* Short Battery Life<br />* Battery Not User Replaceable<br />* Screen Glare<br />* No Wired Network Option<br />* No Video Output<br />* Awkward USB Port Cover<br />* Hibernate Enabled By Default<br /><br />Overall:  The Dell Inspiron Mini Duo is a real mixed bag.  While it performs well as a Netbook, it has some drawbacks to consider.  Users hoping for anything comparable to an iPad or Xoom will be greatly disappointed in the Tablet mode.<br /><br />Setup:  There's not much to do here.  Plug in the power cord and let it rip.  The Duo guides you through a few simple steps to get up and running in minutes.  One thing of note is that the Duo should not be run on battery power until you have charged the battery for 12 hours.<br /><br />Display:  The screen on the Duo is pretty sweet with 1366 x 786 resolution and 720p playback.  Video playback is sharp and clear; however, you will have to have it at the proper angle in order to avoid glare.  This seems to be common on Netbooks with HD playback capability as my HP Mini 210 was the same way.<br /><br />Sound:  With a whopping 320 GB of hard disk, I transferred my entire music collection over to the Duo.  Using my V-Moda Vibe earbuds, I was more than pleased with the sound quality of the music.  The included speakers are decent, but nothing spectacular.  I would recommend something like the Logitech Z305 USB speakers if you do not plan to use earbuds.<br /><br />Processor:  One of the bright spots for the Duo is the Intel Atom N550 processor that it ships with.  Unlike the N450, this is a true dual core processor.  I notice a significant improvement in performance over my Mini 210.  I believe it is for this reason that Windows 7 Home Premium comes standard.  I still don't use the Duo for much more than web and media, but that is more of a factor of the smaller screen.  I would not want to try to do a lot of word processing or spreadsheet manipulation as eye strain would be sure to follow.  If this is not an issue for you, the Duo has the horsepower to do it.<br /><br />Netbook Mode:  I found the keyboard to be more than sufficient for my needs.  Typing e-mails is a non-issue.  It is a bit odd at first to see light coming through the edge of where the true screen rotates to convert to tablet mode, but I adjusted to this quickly.  I like that the touchpad has physically separate left and right mouse buttons.  The touchpad on the Mini 210 could be frustrating because the buttons would often blend with the pad itself.<br /><br />Tablet Mode:  This is where the Duo truly disappoints.  Windows 7 has minimal support for tablets/touchscreens, but it is not that great.  Dell includes their Stage software that launches automatically when you rotate the screen and convert to tablet mode.  It includes basic apps for music, video, books, and painting.  The icons for web and games are shortcuts to IE and a group of game icons respectively.  The true apps are pretty good, but I found navigation to be somewhat sluggish with the touchscreen.  I also prefer the interface in Windows Media Center, but I found it equally sluggish with the touchscreen.  However the real issues come when you try using a regular Windows app with the touchscreen.  You have to be as precise with your finger as you would moving the pointer with a mouse.  To illustrate this I used Outlook Web Express to access my corporate e-mail account.  I had a number of SPAM messages that I wanted to check and delete without reading.  It took me 4-5 times to successfully hit the checkbox for each message.  I gave up after trying the third one.  Normal slider controls are almost impossible to manipulate effectively in tablet mode.  At the end of the day, the majority of the software is just not developed with a touchscreen in mind, and it shows.<br /><br />General Annoyances:  The battery life of the Duo is fairly short.  I haven't gotten more than 3 hours off of a charge where it is typical for my Mini 210 to get 9-10 hours.  It seems that Dell took a (bad) page out of Apple's book, and the batter is not user replaceable.  I don't use these often, but I have found the lack of video output and wired network support to be annoying.  There is not a way to hook the Duo up to the projects at work, and sometimes you have access to wired rather than wireless networks.  I would also dump the USB port cover.  The soft flap will not close over the mini receiver that comes with most mice these days.  I grabbed a Logitech V220 mouse to use with the Duo since it has a larger receiver that is easier to remove when stowing the Duo.  Finally, in Dell's wisdom Hibernate functionality is on by default.  This is a deadly combo when applying Windows Updates.  The Duo wound up in a bad state where the display would not work (although it was backlit with power) when it hibernated while applying Windows Updates.  I wound up having to call Dell Support to get things working again.<br /><br />Advanced Use:  In an attempt to get a better tablet experience I installed Ubuntu Netbook Edition to dual boot with Windows 7.  This is not for the faint of heart, and in the end the improvements just aren't there.  It does perform rather snappy in netbook mode which one would expect from a lighter weight OS.  There are good resources specific to the Duo for doing this on the Ubuntu forms.  I may try to replace the Ubuntu partition with Android for x86, but the currently available version of Android (2.2) is not optimized for tablet usage.  Perhaps when Honeycomb makes its way over the x86 port.<br /><br />Overall:  The Dell Inspiron Mini Duo is an interesting idea, but it fails at the things meant to set it apart.  I would recommend buying a device that does one thing and does it well until someone develops software that spans the netbook/tablet world better."

It was a little jerky when it tried to render 4k at 30 frames per second and stalled completely trying to render 4k at 60 frames per second.   I have computers that will render 4k at 60fps, but they cost at least 4 times what the Inspiron 5485 costs.<br /><br />Users that have huge libraries of music or photos may want to upgrade the SSD.   One of the advantages of the Inspiron line is the ease of upgrading.  With a small screwdriver and some patience it’s very easy to increase the RAM and SSD storage.<br /><br />Summary:<br />The Inspiron 14 5485 is a very good general purpose laptop.  Light enough and small enough to fit in a backpack but powerful enough for most school/home/office tasks.  It would be suitable for a high school or college student or for most home use unless you are doing big application builds or high resolution video rendering."

The theory falls apart somewhat as there are two programmable buttons on the far left side of the mouse: Logitech calls these Thumb Back and Thumb Forward buttons. I found them difficult enough to use as a rightie, I can only imagine it would be more difficult for a leftie.<br /><br />The package includes a carrying case, batteries (the ones in the box were dead) and Windows-ONLY software. I tested the mouse on my MacBook and an ACER laptop. The mouse did work right out of the box on the Mac (once fresh batteries were inserted), but without the 'special features'. To get those to work you need to go to the Logitech site. The file you need is icc222.dmg - a quick download.<br /><br />The key element is the minuscule RF dongle that goes in a USB port. [Bluetooth afficiandos are just going to have to wait.] It's so small that you hardly need to remove it, unless you use a very small tote. If you do want to remove it, there is a convenient storage area inside the mouse.<br /><br />REGULAR FEATURES:<br /><br />Left and Right Buttons: can be set for 1, 2, and 3 clicks as well as click-lock and right click only.<br /><br />The Scroll Wheel lets you adjust increment and acceleration.  Typically a small movement is one line, a big one 5 or more lines (varies, of course, with what Application you are using).<br /><br />There is also an extension 'thingie' for those looking to use it with a big box machine.<br /><br />COOL FEATURES:<br /><br />The Scroll wheel lets you go left and right.  That's right you can now nudge the pointer over.  How cool is that.<br /><br />One-Touch search:  Behind the scroll wheel there is a button with a magnifying glass on it.  You can program that button to load up a search function such as Yahoo, Google, Finder, Sherlock, or even a custom URL.<br /><br />The Thumb Forward/Back buttons can be programmed to do various tasks.  There are more options available on the Windows menu as compared to the bare listing for Apple machines.<br /><br />PROBLEMS:<br /><br />--The BIGGEST problem is that the dang mouse software locked up my MacBook.  It is really difficult to do on a Mac so I can only conclude that Logitech thought of Apple as an afterthought.  Boo-hiss.<br /><br />--The above opinion is supported by the second annoyance which is that they didn't include the Apple software on the disk.<br /><br />--The 'nudge' feature does not work in Open Office (on the Mac) - sigh - although it does work in Adobe.  [Note: this feature worked with everything I tried on my Acer.]<br /><br />--They also could have, for symmetries sake, included another set of programmable buttons on the right hand side of the mouse for lefties.<br /><br />WINDOWS/INTEL RATING:<br /><br />Four Stars [B+].  This is a nice sized mouse with some cool features.  The software is a little slow installing but partially that was because the installer found an upgrade to download.  I would definitely consider buying this mouse for my Acer laptop.  The Zoom programmability and other programmable features work in Open Office, MSWord and Adobe and would make my life easier.<br /><br />MAC RATING:<br /><br />Two Stars. [D+]  The Nano is a nice mouse but it wasn't designed with an Apple user in mind.  The software had to be downloaded from the Logitech site and even then the presentation was inferior to that offered for Windows.  Some features like Zoom are not available to us -period.<br /><br />So, although the Nano has some cool, advanced 'programmable' features,  I can't say that I'd recommend it to Mac users.  That is, unless you are one of those vigilant sorts that can manage to remember not to let your computer go to sleep without turning off the mouse.  Otherwise, it is going to trash your kernel.  And I can't begin to tell you how annoying that was."

Continue to dislike Win 8 but mostly can ignore the App view.  The icons now cannot be moved (except for cut/paste) but that may be due to a botched install of Fences (problem is not isolated to me).  I wanted a good sized laptop with an HDMI port and a DVD player/writer; getting harder to get at this kind of price.  My main interest was the A8 AMD processor.  Sitting side by side with a very similar ASUS laptop with an Intel i5 processor, the A8 is noticeably a little slower, but only a tad with my use (internet, word processing, spreadsheets - not gaming).  Boots up relatively fast (no SSD).  As with many new laptops, it is loaded with crapware.  Most of it is easy to ignore but the preloaded and activated Norton is really a pain.  Defender is disabled.  I haven't yet removed Norton and activated Defender but I will soon.  Defender and MalwareBytes is all I think is needed.  It is not the best keyboard (ergonomically) but I have already used it a lot, and it is quite serviceable.  The touchpad is better than some in that it is not overly sensitive.  Can't say much about the battery as I rarely am unplugged.  Most of my complaints would be about Win8 (e.g., much more difficult to do a system image and restore)."

This SSD also has windows 10 installed in it so there not a lot of room left for all my games on the 512gb drive so I decided to add.  I did about 3 days of online research and decided on this solution.  When it arrived, it took longer to removed the side panel from my tower than it did to install this SSD, which fits nicely in the PCIe m.2 slot.

The event log in the BIOS showed ACPI Shutdown meaning the laptop was gracefully shutting down and not just shutting off.

I replaced the defective battery with a Dell OEM battery, Dell part number 451-BBOG.  This resolved the shutdown problem and the laptop now runs for about 4 hours on a full charge.

AF7HMCVD55KJSMMWCPDP3JDVBE7A,B00B4L2OEE,5,27,True,"If you don't want to read any further, this unit is excellent.  Below is the rest of the story.<br /><br />I was looking for a high-quality rear view camera to use in my car.  I had recently installed a JVC KW-NSX1 head unit with the rear-view camera in mind.<br /><br />There are a lot of rear-view cameras available, ranging from $15 through about as high as you want to pay.  The factory unit for my JVC retails for $200 so that was my benchmark.  However, the JVC camera only shows a horizontal angle of 130 degrees.  I wanted wider ... a lot wider.  IMHO, anything less than about 160 degrees isn't that useful.  Consider backing out of a parking space when you are in a little car ( like my Toyota Corolla) and you are sandwiched between two SUVs.  Oncoming drivers apparently think that if they can see your rear bumper, you can see them.  All I can see is the sheet metal of the SUVs to either side of me.<br /><br />After doing many hours of on-line research, I concluded that all of the low-end units have a very high failure rate and are not worth the effort to install.  Also, I decided I really didn't want night vision; rather, I wanted a camera that was very sensitive to light and didn't need it.  The problem with night vision?  The infrared LEDs are aimed directly in back of you ... doesn't help when you really need to see to the side.<br /><br /> Installation is not all that difficult, but it is tedious if you do it correctly.  I wanted to do the install just once.  That lead me to higher-priced/ higher-rated cameras.<br /><br />I looked for a camera with a water-resistance rating of IP67, low-light sensitivity of at least 0.5 LUX, viewing angle of at least 160 degrees, and theft-security.<br /><br />Boyo was one of the candidate brands.  I would have preferred a camera that mounted in a hole drilled into the car to make it hard to steal ... or even see.  however, I couldn't find any that met my needs ... especially after I had discovered this unit and compared it to a variety of other units that were in the running.<br /><br />I was torn between their older unit (VTL405HD) or this unit (VTL405HDL).  I finally decided to purchase this unit because of the higher quality of the camera and several additional features, including the adjustable backup lines.<br /><br />When I received the unit, I examined it.  It appeared to be well built.<br /><br /> Now that it is installed, here are my observations:<br /><br />PROs<br /><br />1)  Beautiful high-resolution image ... very clear even at night, and the colors are spot on.<br /><br />I haven't had to use the built-in LEDs yet.  However, their limitatons are the same as the night-vision LEDs.  They only illuminate behind and not to the side.<br /><br />2)  It is a major plus that this unit has built-in and adjustable backup lines.<br /><br />3)  BOYO provides stainless-steel bolts and nuts and the  frame is designed so that it completely surrounds the bolt head.<br /><br />The unit is through bolted to the trunk lid.  It is not removable from the outside of the car, which should provide a good measure of security from theft.<br /><br />4)  Great user support.<br /><br />I sent two e-mails and called once.  All three queries were handled intelligently and quickly.  I believe the average response time for the e-mails was less than 15 minutes ... now that's service.<br /><br />5)  The unit is made in  South Korea.<br /><br />6)  The unit can show a normal display, or a view looking down, or a split screen showing both views.<br /><br />i tried that feature and it works well.  I would think the looking-down view would be useful when hitching up to a trailer, but I won't be using that feature as I don't use this car to tow anything.<br /><br />7)  Last but certainly not least, it has a 192 degree viewing angle.<br /><br />180 degrees is perfect for my needs, and 160 would have been acceptable.  This camera easily meets my requirement.  Coupled with that very-wide viewing angle is BOYOs feature called Lens Distortion Correction (LDC).  One might expect a lens that can see more than 180 degrees would be a true fish-eye lens unless it were using exotic optics.  There is certainly lens-induced distortion in the image.  However, between what seems to be excellent optics and LDC feature, the image is quite viewable and very usable.<br /><br />CONs<br />1)  My eyes are 68 years old (young!).  The size of the font in the instruction pamphlet is TINY.<br /><br />2)  The instruction pamphlet does not instruct the user to power the camera off the backup-lamp circuit.<br /><br />I contacted Vision Tech, the maker of the unit, to ask about this, and they said to hook the power up to the backup-lamp circuit.<br /><br />3)  the wire for the unit exits exactly where the edge the my license plate sits.<br /><br />Rather than risking damaging the wire, I cut a small piece out of the license plate to give the wire some breathing room and sanded it smooth  The cut doesn't show as it is hidden under the BOYO unit.  I also installed rubber washers between the license plate and the car to give the wire additional breathing room under there."

Unfortunately, it didn't love me back when I got caught in a major thunderstorm and it got soaked through.  When searching for a new computer, I look at other brands and models before settling on another Inspiron 14z.<br /><br />First, the cosmetics.  This laptop is considered an ultrabook -- it's super thin (0.8&#34;) and light (4.12 pounds).  For a Dell, it's remarkably chic and stylish.  I love the Moon Silver finish.<br /><br />The battery life on this computer is fantastic.  I typically get four to five hours of moderately heavy use; if I'm consciously trying to conserve power (turning down display brightness, limiting programs running in the background, etc.) I can routinely get at least six hours.  Compared to other computers I've owned, this is simply great.  The Inspiron 14z also charges quickly, which is one of my favorite things about it.<br /><br />It has an 1.8 GHz Intel Core i5 processor (a third-generation Intel processor), which is fantastic for the price.  It also comes with a 500 GB hard drive and 6 GB of RAM.  The computer boots up fast and has no problem running numerous memory-intensive programs at once.  The graphics quality is great, it has an HDMI port, and the webcam works wonderfully.  I definitely give it 5/5 for overall performance.<br /><br />As with most Dell products, it takes some initial tweaking to get the machine working the way you want.  Adjust the sleep/hibernation settings right off the bet to avoid major annoyance (the default is far shorter than I prefer), change the energy-saving preferences, and alter the trackpad settings.  I also uninstalled McAfee and installed Norton instead (personal preference -- I've had major performance problems with McAfee in the past).  It takes a few days to get used to a new trackpad and keyboard, but the transition was easy for me, as I've owned an Inspiron 14z in the past.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this ultrabook.  It looks fabulous, is light and portable, and is lightning fast.  That, combined with the excellent battery life, make this a fantastic product in my book.  Enjoy!"

This is for a number of reasons (some which are not AMD/CPU issues, per se) Be advised that this is *not* a genuine quad core CPU (it has two *non-independent* cores) and Windows does not fully support this CPU yet!  However, note that the FX 4100 dominates cost to performance ratios versus Intel - the only selling point.<br /><br />The ""quad core"" advertising is grossly misleading.  The FX 4100 operates the cores differently than its predecessors to obtain ""quad core"" performance effects.  Unfortunately, that doesn't change the fact it really is only two effective cores and the four core operation must share CPU resources.  Worse, Windows does not properly support the FX's new methods of operation!  A new patch is due 2012 Q1 to Windows to rectify the performance issues.  I won't explain here but further reading:  articles regarding MS KB2592546<br /><br />AMD FX 4100 WEI of only 7.2 - my prior AMD 840 managed 7.4 with an inferior system.  The Windows Rating is normally to be taken with a grain of salt except hardware review benchmarks have come to similar (relative) conclusions.  Real life usage of this CPU also shows a performance hit.<br /><br />This CPU is excellent ""bang for your buck"" but there are serious issues at play:<br />1. Highly misleading advertising with the quad core.  This is a dual core that (with unsupported tech) operating as a quad core.<br />2. Microsoft will not fully support this CPU until 2012 Q1.  AMD has liaisons with Microsoft & this should have been coordinated prior to release.<br />3. The two cores on this CPU do not perform that well. Again, cost-to-performance considerations are the only thing that make it worthwhile.<br /><br />This CPU is fine if you're upgrading from a dated AMD system.  I would advise Intel Core users to hold tight.  Benchmarks indicate you're better off with a Phenom II, a predecessor, until 1. Better software app support and 2. Better CPU support in Windows.<br /><br />Note:  Someone will eventually comment that Windows shows 4 cores in task or device manager.  Again, this doesn't change the fact the CPU is operating only 2 hardware ""modules"" operating as 4 cores.<br /><br />Edit: Clarified since some people want to bring the term ""module"" into play due to successful AMD marketing."

AEDBG5SI337W6YK5ZQW3ZIHJMFTA,B0039RWAVS,4,1,True,"I bought this TV a couple weeks ago despite all the negative reviews describing the TN panel quality.  I'm not sure which panel I got (there were probably 8 different serial numbers on the box) but I have no such issues with viewing angles, color quality, or overall picture quality.  I may have lucked out and gotten the IPS panel, but I can't tell you for sure.  What I can tell you is this TV was definitely worth the extra money spent over an entry level HDTV.  I had seen LED TVs before and the picture quality beats just about any regular backlit LCD hands-down.  The contrast is beautiful and although the blacks aren't true blacks, they are pretty close.  An LED backlit TV is kind of the middle ground between LCD and Plasma monitors as far as picture quality goes.<br /><br />There are a ton of menu options, picture options, and you can automatically tell that a lot of time went into tweaking the user interface.  One feature that I didn't notice upon purchase was the USB port, which I plugged my external hard drive into and it automatically recognized all my AVI video files, picture files and music files.  Another great feature is you can change the picture settings for each individual input, which saves a lot of hassle when you spend a lot of time using additional sources.  The TV itself is beautiful, although I would have preferred a slightly smaller bezel surrounding the panel.  However, you will be amazed by how thin the panel is - less than 2 inches!<br /><br />On the negative side, the DTV tuner is a bit weaker than my previous TV - for some reason, NBC (which came in with no problem before) makes a clicking sound every 10-15 seconds when receiving a 1080i signal.  Given my antenna is not the strongest, this may be resolved by getting a true outdoor antenna, but it is annoying to have a cheap tuner in a pricey TV.  Also, the speakers are not the best - it is quite okay if you are only concerned about spoken word, but any music/soundtrack loses impact when playing through the tinny speakers.  A real enthusiast would immediately purchase surround sound / sound bar / some kind of external speakers.<br /><br />Another negative is the 120 hz feature, which I have found not all that useful.  I have turned it on during sports and been quite happy with the results, but I usually keep it off or set to ""low"" when watching TV or movies.  The reason: the feature is always turned on, although it is only useful in fast-action scenes.  I wish there was some kind of intelligent feature where it would turn sense fast-moving action, because it is makes motion look fake/plastic-y in regular non-action scenes.<br /><br />Overall, this TV is worth it just for the amazing picture quality.  And I am quite picky about my picture quality."

AF2TS3KEYKELC73VSUTRGAE44FQQ,B005O65JXI,3,0,True,"Although CM makes probably the most popular CPU coolers, the 212 EVO is one I love to hate. Although it does what it's supposed to, their mounting system almost always drives me crazy!! I've used these on both AMD and Intel builds but generally go to another brand with a different mount system. As with many others, I can never get these coolers to snug down properly without sliding all over the place. It takes very little pressure to make them slip and slide all over the CPU and that's worrisome to me. The thermal paste probably keeps the base of this cooler in contact with the CPU but shouldn't the mount between the two be more solid? The adjustable &#34;X&#34; bracket, the &#34;guts&#34; to the whole assembly, only contacts a tiny area of the base thus supplying just a tiny bit of pressure to keep it tight. Maybe the loose fit bothers me more than it should, but in the future, will stay away from the 212 Evo."
AF2TS3KEYKELC73VSUTRGAE44FQQ,B00JKCHDKY,5,6,False,"I just updated an older Gigabyte board running an AMD Phenom chip to this one but using an Intel i5 4690 chip. I used the same case and power supply. I formatted a new SSD and did a clean install of Windows 7. I also used the included Gigabyte disk for drivers, etc until such time I could D/L the most current ones. Bios was F8 which is the current one. So, here's the problem I'm having and ask the community if they have a solution. The computer POSTS fine and goes into Windows in about 10 seconds. I even get the code ""AO"" on the digital readout. Here's the question-  I can't get any USB device to work in particular my mouse and keyboard! Perhaps none of the USB drivers were installed? The only way mouse and keyboard will work is in BIOS but other than that- nothing : (  It wouldn't be a big deal to re-format my SSD again and reinstall Windows (and the Gigabyte Installation Disk), but does anyone know if there's a simpler solution?

During the initial set-up, the Gigabyte Setup/Utilities disk didn't to a very good job of installing the USB3 drivers. That's why the mouse and keyboard didn't work after booting into Windows. Using a PS2 mouse (like Sarah), I used the Gigabyte Utilities Disk and again downloaded the appropriate drivers. For lack of a better phrase, they didn't ""take"" the first time. Now, the motherboard works like a champ and works very well. I now fully endorse this product and highly recommend it to those shopping for an Intel (or AMD) board. Although two people have had USB driver problems, it was an easy fix and probably due to a glitch on the Utilities Disk."
AF2TS3KEYKELC73VSUTRGAE44FQQ,B0074OVYVE,5,1,True,"I have these mounted on three desktop computers and am completely satisfied with them. Two are on AMD motherboards and one on an Intel board. You have the option of using just the one (included) fan or a 2nd fan for push/pull. Enermax includes a 2nd set of clips for another fan. The mounting system is straight forward and rock solid. You can easily see how its done from several great tutorials on YouTube. On all three of my systems, my idle temperature varies between 26-32 degrees C. I can't comment on the upper temps since I'm not much into gaming. When installing, be aware that there are two directional arrows etched on the top plate of the cooler. Make sure the arrows are pointed in the direction of where you want the air to blow. When I first installed the cooler the arrows were facing the opposite way yet the fan mounted properly and was blowing the proper way. However, I noticed a slight whistling sound which shouldn't have been there. When I oriented the cooler the correct way and reinstalled the fan there was...... silence! Funny this should happen since the cooler looks the exact same whether looking at it from the front or back. Maybe the fins inside are oriented a certain way for optimal cooling? On my other installs, I paid attention to the arrows and had no noise issues at all. An additional note- I use the &#34;pea size&#34; application of thermal paste as opposed to covering the entire CPU. The pea sized gob of paste spreads out perfectly when tightening down a cooler, whether it's this one or any other brand."

I have used Cooler Master cases and Lian Li, but like this one the best. It is solidly built throughout and the plastic side panel is particularly attractive to show off the ""goodies"" you've used on your build. There are more than ample openings in the side that makes cable management a snap. As someone pointed out (either here or at another site) that the cut out for the 8 pin mother board power cable is placed incorrectly and sits directly under the mobo. I hope Enermax realizes this and corrects the error. However, there IS a small slot about 4"" away that WILL allow you to route the cable from the power supply to the mobo. The tool-less design of the drive trays works great as does the front slots for the DVD player/burner and card reader I use. I did use some screws on the right side to give those things a bit more stability, however. The front panel with the red LED fans is really attractive as well as the overall design of the case. It's sort of industrial looking and looks like it means business! Kudos to Amazon for packing this case inside a separate cardboard box as added protection during shipment.

AF2TS3KEYKELC73VSUTRGAE44FQQ,B009F1JL5A,5,17,False,"In early March, I bought the Asus U47a, notebook which is sort of the big brother of the VivoBook S400ca. Since I use the U47a for my online banking (Quicken) and my more `serious' work, I bought the S400ca for travel and portability. So far, Baby Brother has been excellent and has exceeded all my expectations. The only difference between the VivoBook and the other is a smaller HDD, less RAM, a slightly slower processor, no back lit keyboard, no DVD drive, one less USB port, and a glossy screen. However, the glossy touch screen is mandatory if you're going to use Windows 8 to its full potential since that's the idea behind it. Despite these differences, I really enjoy this ultrabook and find myself using it more than its big brother.<br />Since there's no DVD drive, the form factor is a lot sleeker and makes the unit weigh a bit less. Most software is now downloadable so a DVD drive isn't as important these days. If you do need one, an excellent external drive is only about $30.<br />Many have mentioned that the glossy screen creates some glare, which is true. But, without the glossy touch screen, Win 8 would be almost impossible to use. I actually prefer the glossy screen of the VivoBook over the U47a.  I feel there's more resolution and clarity. A glossy screen also seems like it would be easier to clean as opposed to a scratch prone matte screen.<br />This computer has a great feel to it and wonderful fit and finish. The keyboard action is just about perfect for me and keeps my typos to a bare minimum! I haven't been subjected to any of the track pad problems I've read others are having so maybe I'm just plain lucky! Even the fan is well-behaved and when it does run, it's whisper quiet.<br />The VivoBook begs to be upgraded to really boost performance and make it fly faster. Asus uses a one piece back rather than little compartments to get to the RAM and HDD but don't let that deter you. All you need is a small Phillips screwdriver, an old credit card, or a plastic knife. First, take out the 10 screws that hold down the back cover. A magnetized screwdriver helps tremendously for removal/reinstalling these screws. Beginning near either hinge, start prying apart the back from the main body. You'll hear clicking/snapping sounds as the tabs/clips separate. The plastic knife or credit card will insure you don't scratch anything as you're prying. In a moment or two, you'll have the back off. Keep the screws in a cup or other spot so they don't get lost. There are three things you can do once you're inside the case. Replace the stock HDD with a SSD, add a stick of RAM, and put in a better wi-fi card if you desire. Since I get a perfect wi-fi signal and no drops with the OEM card, I'll leave that alone for now. The RAM slot is easily accessible but for some reason new RAM seems to resist snapping into place, so take your time with this. The HDD is removed by taking out just 3 screws. Several reviewers have said that it's hard getting the proper sized SDD for this and they've had to remove the case of their SDD to make it fit. This computer takes a 2 ½"" drive that's 7mm thick. The Samsung 840, G.Skill, Crucial, and Intel SSD's will all fit perfectly. Just make sure you read the specs before ordering to insure you're getting the 7mm one as several makers also produce a 9.5mm drive, as well.<br />To make things easy if you upgrade to a SSD, here's what I do. On the OEM drive, remove all the bloatware that you don't want or need. If you're not a McAffee fan, get rid of that, too. Then, simply clone your original drive to the SSD you plan to install. I have used the Easus Todo cloning software with perfect results in every SSD upgrade I've ever done. Youtube has some excellent videos that show how the cloning process is done and it's not really that hard. Some people prefer to do a clean install of Win 8 but you need to be more tech savvy to go that route. But, once your new drive is cloned, just remove the old, pop in the new, and you're ready to go!<br />With my additional 4GB of RAM and a Samsung 840 SDD, my Windows Experience Index is:<br />Processor: 6.9<br />Memory (RAM): 7.4<br />Graphics: 4.6<br />Gaming graphics: 6.2<br />Primary hard disk (SSD): 8.1<br />So, as you can see, this is a screaming little machine with just a few, quick additions!<br />There are just a few things that I'm not crazy about with the VivoBook. If the top had a shiny aluminum finish, it would be just perfect! The black aluminized finish really is a fingerprint magnet.  However, a spritz of Windex on a cloth will instantly remove them. This is my first notebook with the power plug on the right side as opposed to the left. It seems I'm always snagging the cord when I stand up since (in my mind) I think it's on the left side. This isn't a negative but just something that will take getting used to on my part.<br />For those who aren't too crazy about Win 8 and miss the halcyon days of Windows 7, you can easily download something called ""Classic Shell"" which may ease your transition into the newer OS. It sure has helped me!<br />Enjoy your new Asus because it's really a standout in the world of ultrabooks especially when you consider what you're getting for your money!<br /><br />*********************************************IMPORTANT BIOS INFORMATION***********************************<br />My computer had version 206 installed. The current BIOS version is 207. For the life of me, I couldn't get the EZ Flash function to work in order to flash to the newer version.

On the next screen, locate the BIOS file which you have downloaded to a thumbdrive earlier. The download, once unzipped, should say ""S400CAAS.207"" The type file it is should say ""207.""

AGZ6BVFQ5LTXY7PW5RNVM3A56HCQ,B0764HW116,5,21,True,"When I got the computer, I noticed that the display was an FHD and not a UHD.  My first thought was to return it for a refund.  I was told that I had 30 days from the date of purchase to return it.  So, it occurred to me to give it a try and see how I liked it.  Prior to this laptop, I had a Sager with similar specs and it had a UHD display.  When I used the Sager, I normally had it set to less than 2160p.  The reason being, was the size of the fonts.  Yes, there is a way to adjust the fonts in Windows 10.  But I’ve found that many applications I use, do not adjust the fonts properly.  So, many of my apps would be very difficult to use simply because the font size was too small.  Given that I had the display set to less than 2160p, the display never had that crisp appearance that you would get while in native mode.  So, I had to ask myself… Would I prefer to have a laptop with a UHD display and have the resolution reduced (and have less “crispiness”?  Or would I be better off with a laptop set to a native resolution of 1080p?  I had to find out.  So, that’s what I’ve been doing over the past few weeks.  Thus far, I think the Dell looks better in its native mode, than the Sager does at a resolution below its native mode.  This turned out to be the deciding factor.  I’m going to keep the Dell.<br /><br />What I like about this laptop (Pros):<br />1.) As stated above, I find the display to be sharp, sufficiently bright, and the colors appear true.<br />2.) The HDMI output supports 4k@60hz.<br />3.) I like the fact that it comes with a  USB 3.1 Gen 1 Type-C with Thunderbolt 3 port.  I don’t have a use for it at the moment, but I think I will in the future.<br />4.) The back-lit keyboard is nice.  It has a nice tactile feel and does not bend with the pressure of my hands.<br />5.) I consider this a gaming laptop, but I like the fact that it doesn’t look too flamboyant.  It’s reasonably thin, is made of durable material and feels sturdy.<br />6.) To access components such as the RAM and storage drives requires the removal of just one screw that secures the (underside) cover.  I’ve installed a 500 and 480 GB SSD drives with no issues.<br />7.) It plays all of the games I enjoy with no issues.<br />8.) It doesn’t come with bloatware.<br />9.) While using the computer for browsing the internet, playing videos, and productivity, it remains cool and fans on low (and quiet).<br />10.)  The fingerprint reader makes logging in a no brainer.<br />11.) The BIOS settings are the best I’ve ever seen in all of the laptops I’ve owned thus far.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.) The fan can get a bit loud when playing some graphics intensive games.  Having the sound volume turned up usually drowns out the fan noise, though.<br />2.) It doesn’t have enough indicator lights.  It only has only one for when it is on charge or the storage drive is active.  Otherwise, no indicator lights for power, wireless, etc, like most laptops do.<br />3.) The power adapter is big.  To be honest, it’s about the same size as most other gaming laptops, so no real surprise.<br /><br />Other observations:<br />1.) Setting up a dual/external monitor configuration via the HDMI port is a bit awkward.  When connected to an external monitor, you must use the Nvidia control panel to adjust its video settings.  While the built-in display settings are always adjusted via the Intel Graphics Settings.  I’ve yet to try a triple display configuration via the thunderbolt port, so I can’t comment on that.<br /><br />Overall, I’d recommend this laptop to anyone.  Despite the fact that the display has less resolution than is stated.  After owning a laptop with a 2160p display, I prefer 1080p over it, because the fonts just don’t scale across all apps, and I find that 1080p is sufficiently “crisp” on a 15.6” display."

(This isn't a problem on my MAC!!!)<br /><br />Bad Points<br />- The back button is out of reach of your thumb so you have to ""crawl"" your hand forward to reach the back button. I'm sure if my thumb were as long as my index finger the mouse back button would be reachable but as of now it is not.<br />- Not sure about battery life. Haven't had it long enough to know. Hope it lasts ok. The power is shut off when you fold it shut so the more you fold it shut, the longer the battery life.<br />- It's not bluetooth. Would be nice to not lose a USB port when I want to use a mouse AND USB drive AND another USB thing.<br /><br />As you can see there are only a few negative points.<br />It's a pretty solid mouse.<br />If you want the added features go to [.....] and search for intellimouse and you can get the extended software for interesting features.<br /><br />Try one. They're a bit pricier than I'd prefer but I gifted it to myself because I'll be in Kuwait for a year. : /<br /><br />** Update after 2 years it, without reason died. ***<br />Not sure if it's programmed to do so so you have to go buy another one but it's possible.<br />Avoid products which are designed to fail after XX number of uses or time. It only encourages manufacturers to create junk.<br /><br />*** 3 Year Update ***<br />- The USB transmitter died and the mouse is now useless.<br />Awesome Microsoft, thanks.<br />This so called ""Planned Obsolescence"" where products are designed to fail so you must buy a new one irritates the heck out of me.<br /><br />*** Latest update 4 years: I tried the USB receiver again to see if it worked and it still works.<br />Weird, I Tried it on a different computer and it didn't appear to work but now it does.<br />sweet."
AHUMNEVSPWC2AAF3JKC6P3J2DV5Q,B01BIWKP58,5,0,True,In an Intel NUC.  Good enough.
AHQH6S4ZMV5V7SG424B5EINPZ33A,B07X5KSBNJ,5,0,True,"I wasn't a fan of the other dongle/dock options on Amazon because they all looked cheap, like they would last a week in a laptop bag or traveling, but this ones got a nice metal case. Sturdy!<br /><br />I replaced my Dell work dock with this dongle and haven't had any issues pushing 2 monitors at 1440p after installing OEM drivers from Intel."
AFTFD27LOA2Q2SOVZWG5ZXRSS3DQ,B000PMGZDO,5,1,True,"I doubled my RAM in my Macbook Pro with this kit, I think mine is a 2008 2.4 Ghz Intel Core 2 Duo.  I went from 2 GB 667mhz DDR2 SDRAM to 4GB.  Super quick, popped the battery out, used a micro-screwdriver to remove the 3 screws in the metal plate and then you can see the RAM.<br /><br />After that you GENTLY push the two little metal tabs out outwards and you can GENTLY pull up on the old ram and then slide it out at an angle.<br /><br />Reverse the process, boot the computer up, and check your stats in &#34;About This Mac&#34; - it'll show the upgraded memory immediately.<br /><br />PERFECT!"
AFBH3IKEY67ZT5SFWPNEYIR3MYOA,B00CRJSV9O,4,0,True,"Used one of these in my new system.<br /><br />Only issue I've had with it is the stock intel CPU fan wouldn't spin fast enough on startup, so I had to go into BIOS and lower the minimum fan speed."
AEJ5FTL5L4X6TCBUSQEHC5SKWPNQ,B0019NKGR4,4,0,True,"Fast CPU...Haven't had any problems with it yet; only had it a couple of months, though. Never had any issues with Intel processors."
